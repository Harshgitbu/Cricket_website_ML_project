What he observed - not just from his own side's lacklustre display, but the inspiration provided by Brendon McCullum's New Zealand side - convinced him an entirely new approach was necessary in England's cricket with a policy of No Fear (and No Retribution) at its heart. It required a man of strong will not just to say it, but to implement it, but Morgan did so, seeking to fashion a side that would play with courage and be impervious to pressure or criticism. \n"", 'The revival he led was dramatic. Going into the 2019 World Cup year, England were rated not only the No. 1 ODI side but had set a host of new records, including the two highest scores made in the format. Morgan, relentlessly committed to this bold style of play on good days and bad, was at the heart of the transformation.', ""Morgan's self-sufficiency and independent thought has caused him to tread a path that has not always been popular with English administrators. He preferred the IPL to county cricket long before it was ECB policy. Although he strove for a while to play for England in all three formats, he played the last of his 16 Tests in 2012 and his interest in the longer format appeared to wane once he recognised he had little chance of a recall. He didn't play any first-class cricket in 2016 or 2017 and averaged 11 when he returned for half-a-dozen games in 2018. A somewhat private man, he is respected by his players for his inner strength, cool temperament and tactical nous but remains largely a closed book to those outside the dressing room."", 'Once the selectors had decided to dispense with Alastair Cook just before Christmas in 2014, Morgan, the regular ODI deputy, was the most obvious candidate.  But his elevation coincided with one of his worst periods of form since switching to England from Ireland. A left-hander who quickly built a reputation for inventive and audacious strokeplay, Morgan also possessed the patience and power of shot to be a natural ""finisher"" - a role England had struggled to fill for a decade. In some ways, he was a prototype, encouraging the English game to adopt a more inventive approach only subsequently to face up to the challenge that he might be overtaken by more highly-powered models.', 'As a young man in Dublin, Morgan was recognised as a cricketer of rare unorthodox talent, who plays the ball exceptionally late and was adroit both at sweeping and reverse sweeping. Time at Dulwich College only hardened his desire to play for England, which he never tried to hide back in Ireland.', ""Morgan made his Ireland debut at the age of 16, making 99 against Scotland in Ayr, and was soon signed by Middlesex, who gave him his debut a week after his 19th birthday. He floundered in the 2007 World Cup: batting at No. 3, he made only 91 runs in nine games. But he soon established himself in the Middlesex line up, especially in limited overs cricket, and his switch to England was long anticipated. After securing Ireland's qualification for the 2011 World Cup, in April 2009, he was called up by England, thereby denying Ireland the chances to pick him in the World T20 and beyond."", ""At the age of 23, he shot to prominence on the back of two match-winning innings against South Africa. First was a 34-ball 67 in the Champions Trophy in September 2009, followed two months later with an unbeaten 45-ball 85 in the opening Twenty20 of England's tour of South Africa. His bold approach and crisp hitting evoked comparisons with Kevin Pietersen."", 'His growing stature was confirmed when he was the only England player to be awarded a new contract at the auction for the third season of the IPL in January 2010. He was signed for $220,000 by Bangalore, where he joined England team-mate Pietersen. But he failed to make an impression and was soon left on the bench. He returned to his best for England in the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean as his powerful shot-making and coolness under pressure helped England to their first triumph in global limited-overs events. With three ODI hundreds that year, his first for England coming against Bangladesh in Dhaka, his reputation was soaring.', ""Despite a modest first-class record he was rewarded with a surprise call-up to the Test side for England's first Test of the 2010 summer, against Bangladesh. Walking out to bat at 258 for 4, he could not have asked for a gentler introduction and showed enough confidence to pick up his first Test boundary with a reverse-sweep. With the retirement of Paul Collingwood, a permanent space opened up in England's Test side. Centuries against Pakistan (2010) and India (2011) represented the high points."", 'But a disastrous tour of the UAE in early 2012 effectively ended his Test career. With Joe Root making his debut before the end of the year, he never returned to the Test side.', ""He remained an indispensable member of the one-day side, though. And while there were prolonged fallow periods - from September 2012, for example, he went a year and 17 innings without an ODI half-century and, by the time he was appointed captain, he had scored one fifty in 19 innings - he produced enough outstanding innings (not least a match-defining century against Ireland) to retain his place. Going into the 2019 World Cup, he was England's record run-scorer in ODIs."", 'While his captaincy record at domestic level was not inspiring - Middlesex won five out of 22 limited-overs matches under him in 2014 - and the 2015 World Cup campaign was painfully poor, progress was fast once England embraced a new coaching regime (Peter Moores was sacked in May 2015) and bolder selections. A watershed series against New Zealand saw England, so hesitant and mediocre at the World Cup, pass 350 three times in 10 days in registering their highest ever ODI total (408-9; subsequently overtaken) and their highest ever second-innings total (365-9; also subsequently overtaken). A new template had been set.', ""Such was Morgan's statute within the side, he survived his decision to skip the Bangladesh tour in 2016 on security grounds - the players had been given a choice whether to tour, though the impression remained the management had rather hoped the captain would lead the way - and oversaw a spell of 12 bi-lateral series wins out of 13, including nine in a row broken only by an aberrational defeat against Scotland. If highlights were a 4-1 victory in Australia in early 2018 and a 5-0 whitewash at home later in the year, it was all a prelude to the 2019 World Cup which will surely define both his and his side's legacy.\n"", '\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2003, 2004']",16.0,24,1,700.0,130,30.43,1278,54.77,2,3,77,6,11.0,0.0,217.0,203,29,6813.0,124*,39.15,7592,89.73,12,43,575,182,77.0,0.0,80.0,78,15,1753.0,85*,27.82,1347,130.14,0,9,131,78,35.0,0.0,99.0,164,16,4912,209*,33.18,9649,50.90,11,23,,,75.0,1.0,345.0,319,44,10667,161,38.78,11850,90.01,20,64,,,116.0,0.0,267.0,253,34,5595,90,25.54,4378,127.79,0,28,436,238,126.0,0.0,16.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,217.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,80.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,99.0,,102,90,2,2/24,2/24,45.00,5.29,51.0,0,0,0,345.0,,42,49,0,-,-,-,7.00,-,0,0,0,267.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

Lumb's confident strokeplay was not short of swagger and was just what England needed at the top of the order as they sought to bring more vigour to their short-form game. No respecter of tradition, he was also one of the first England cricketers to make unabashed calls for the ECB to introduce a city-based Twenty20 tournament.  \n"", ""Lumb, the son of prolific Yorkshire opener Richard Lumb, was born in South Africa and made his way through the junior teams in Transvaal before returning to his roots to play for Yorkshire. A hard-hitting batsman, he made his county debut in 2000, scoring 66 not out against the touring Zimbabweans. A knee injury in 2001 meant that he played only a small part in Yorkshire's success in winning the county championship that year, although he did record a maiden first-class hundred against Leicestershire. In doing so he became part of only the fourth father and son pair to score centuries for Yorkshire."", ""He made progress in 2002 by becoming a regular member of both the Championship and limited-overs sides and in 2003 scored close to a thousand first-class runs at an average of over 40, including two centuries and six fifties. He was selected for the ECB National Academy squad the following winter, but has failed to progress to Yorkshire's expectations and was dropped during the 2005 season.  Although he averaged in the middle-thirties in 2006 with a top score of 144 he decided to leave at the end of the season and joined Hampshire."", 'The move galvanised his career, and his prolific Twenty20 form in 2009, where he made 442 runs from 11 games as Hampshire won the Friends Provident Trophy, including a blistering unbeaten 124 from 69 balls against Essex, earned him a $50,000 IPL contract with Rajasthan Royals.  It proved to be the launch-pad to higher achievements.', ""On the back of an unbeaten 58 to guide England Lions to victory against the senior team in a warm-up match in Dubai, he was called in as the latest incarnation of England's Twenty20 specialist opener for the World Twenty20 in Caribbean in May 2010. His selection was a revelation as, despite a top score of 33, he routinely muscled brisk starts which set the tone that carried England to their first ever triumph in a global limited-overs event."", ""Injury disrupted his 2011 season, the final year of his contract  with Hampshire, but he was identified by Nottinghamshire as batsman who could bolster an unreliable top order in four-day cricket and director of cricket Mick Newell, who remembered Lumb's career-best Championship score of 219 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 2010, signed him on a three-year contract. "", 'His debut season for Nottinghamshire yielded more than 1,400 runs across all formats, including 910 in the Championship.  Although he did not make the starting XI in any of their matches, Lumb regained his place in the England Twenty20 squad in time for the defence of the World Twenty20 before playing a starring role for Sydney Sixers in the Champions League in South Africa, hitting an unbeaten 82 off 42 balls as the Australian franchise beat Lions by 10 wickets in the final.', 'Suspicions that Lumb might increasingly become a T20 specialist were confounded in 2013 when he returned more than 1,000 Championship runs. He skipped the IPL auction in 2014, saying he had ""ticked that box"" but England - and Sydney - retained an interest in his T20 skills and he was named in England\'s squad for World T20 in Bangladesh.', 'Lumb teamed up with Riki Wessels in 2016 to set what was a new record stand for a List A game in England: 342 in 39.2 overs in a Royal London Cup game against Northants at Trent Bridge, beating the 318 amassed by India\'s Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly against Sri Lanka in Taunton in the 1999 World Cup. Lumb, who made 184, commented that it was one of those days ""when the stars were all aligned"". Nottinghamshire\'s 445 for 8 in their 50 overs was the second highest total in List A matches worldwide at the time. Astonishingly, despite being stricken by injuries, Northants got within 20 runs. Lumb also hit the mark with a 17-ball T20 50 against Leicestershire, one of the fastest in Notts\' history, but his poor Championship form had much in keeping with a Notts relegation season.', ""Lumb's final summer came in Notts' triumphant 2017 season when they added promotion in the Championship to both limited-overs trophies. He was part of the Notts side that beat Surrey in the Royal London Cup final at Lord's, but then retired later that month because of an ankle injury. \n \n"", '\n']",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,3.0,3,0,165.0,106,55.0,203,81.28,1,0,12,3,1.0,0.0,27.0,27,1,552.0,63,21.23,413,133.65,0,3,64,21,8.0,0.0,210.0,352,18,11443,221*,34.26,,,21,58,,,118.0,0.0,221.0,213,11,6623,184,32.78,7614,86.98,8,44,,,72.0,0.0,221.0,219,12,4972,124*,24.01,3605,137.91,1,26,597,176,72.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,3.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,27.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,210.0,,342,260,6,2/10,,43.33,4.56,57.0,0,0,0,221.0,,12,28,0,-,-,-,14.00,-,0,0,0,221.0,3,36,65,3,3/32,3/32,21.66,10.83,12.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He joined Somerset when he was 18 and made his international debut four years later, little more than a week after qualifying for England. He was briefly England\'s answer at the top of the order, helping them win the 2010 World Twenty20 and rise up the one-day rankings. But his form stuttered and he was dropped after the India tour in January 2013. He returned to the squad at the 2014 World T20 but failed to add to his 46 one-day internationals and 25 T20Is. During the subsequent English season, he suffered a sickening blow in the face, breaking his nose and damaging his eye socket while batting against Northants when a delivery from David Willey burst through his grille. It forced him into retirement in June 2015 as he conceded defeat to impaired vision and what he indicated was psychological trauma. ""I feel I will never be mentally the player I was,"" he said. \n', 'He played for South Africa at the 2006 Under-19 World Cup before coming to Millfield School. He made his Somerset first-team debut in April 2007, scoring 69 not out off 58 balls and taking a catch his coach described as ""world class"". The batsmen-friendly conditions at Taunton aided his attacking instincts and in the 2009 English season, his last before he qualified, he scored 1,242 runs at a 59.14 in the County Championship as well as averaging almost 50 in one-day cricket.', 'The selectors, who had been watching for some time, rewarded him with a place on the Lions tour of UAE although Geoff Miller did caution that England ""had to be careful about the number of South Africans in the side"". Yet Kieswetter was undeterred and repeated his allegiance to England when Graeme Smith said he\'d like to him to come back to South Africa.', ""The day after he became eligible for England in February 2010 he hit 81 against the senior side in Abu Dhabi, enough to earn a rapid elevation to the full squad for Bangladesh where his first innings of the tour was the small matter of 143. It was a promising sign. He made a century in his third ODI, against Bangladesh before playing a crucial role in delivering England's first ever global limited-overs success in the World Twenty20. Alongside Michael Lumb, Kieswetter powered England to aggressive starts, making 222 runs in the tournament, the fourth-highest tally, including a Man-of-the-Match winning 63 in the final against Australia."", 'But that proved his high water mark. In his next 18 T20s for England, Kieswetter made only two half-centuries and was eventually dropped for the crucial World T20 tie against Sri Lanka in 2012. Jos Buttler, his county team-mate, took his place and Buttler eventually usurped him from the ODI side too.', 'In 2013, a battle ensued between Kieswetter and Buttler for the gloves at Somerset but Kieswetter did enough to earn the No. 1 slot with over 500 runs in the Friends Life t20 - form that earned him a deal in the Australian Big Bash League - an average of 56.80 in the Yorkshire Bank 40 and 31.89 in first-class cricket. Buttler left for Lancashire at the end of the season.', ""Kieswetter initially thrived in the ODI side, averaging 51.00 in the five-match series at home to Sri Lanka in 2011 but in his next 23 innings made only two half-centuries. Struggling in India could be forgiven and he didn't get too many chances in subsequent series that England dominated against Pakistan and Australia as he was moved down the order. But with his wicketkeeping not the sharpest, the calls for change grew after a top score of 33 in four innings against South Africa. He went back to India in January 2013 but was dropped for the final two ODIs and was then left out of the tour to New Zealand under new one-day coach Ashley Giles."", 'He had initially hoped to fully recover from his injury, sustained when struck by a short delivery from Willey. He returned at the end of 2015 season and then went to play domestic T20 in South Africa, but struggled with the after-effects of the injury and announced he would not be playing the 2015 English season.', '""I realise I am one of those lucky people who earns a living doing something they truly love,"" he said.

After being awarded a benefit year by his club in 2007, he was given his chance to shine for England when called up to their one-day squad in June. It was a long overdue selection as Hampshire supporters will attest to, but Mascarenhas made his chance count, slapping five sixes in a single over from Yuvraj Singh at The Oval, and earning a call-up to England's Twenty20 squad on the back of some disciplined bowling performances. His growing reputation in the shorter forms of the game saw him as the first England player to join the Indian Premier League, in 2009, and later that year he captained Hampshire to a Friends Provident Trophy triumph at Lord's, where Sussex were beaten in the final."", 'It was at the IPL, in 2010, however, that Mascarenhas suffered a serious Achilles injury that meant he bowled just three overs for Hampshire in the season and eventually needed surgery.

His talents have been particularly apparent in Test cricket where his command of swing bowling, especially on his home grounds, has been the stuff of artistry, bearing comparison with any swing bowler in any age. He has been an integral part of three victorious Ashes campaigns and became the first England bowler to take 500 Test wickets, leaving Ian Botham's previous benchmark of 383 a mere dot on the horizon. His one-day career has also had its moments as he gradually became adept at bowling in a more defensive fashion, but it is as an attacking swing bowler where he has had few peers. \n"", 'Anderson\'s 500th Test wicket came in September 2017 when he dismissed Kraigg Brathwaite in a Lord\'s Test against the West Indies. It was a delivery that illustrated his talent, coming down the slope to hit middle stump (his 501st - to bowl Kieran Powell - was even better). He became only the sixth player, and third pace bowler seamer after McGrath and Courtney Walsh, to reach the landmark and admitted to feeling emotional. ""Normally it\'s anger but today it was a bit more, not quite teary but emotional. I don\'t get like that when trying to focus on my job and it took me a bit by surprise.""', 'Anderson has been something of a contradiction. He has had a reputation for being shy and uncommunicative off the field, except in the company of close friends, yet on the field his verbal aggression, which he has argued is necessary to conquer that diffident character, not always endeared him to opponents or critics.', ""For the first six years of Anderson's international career, the best way to sum up his bowling was to paraphrase Mother Goose: when he's good, he's very, very good - and when he's bad, he's horrid. But when the force was with him, he was capable of irresistible spells, seemingly able to swing the ball round corners at an impressive speed."", ""Anderson had played only three one-day games for Lancashire when he was hurried into England's one-day squad in Australia in 2002-03 as cover for Andy Caddick. He didn't have a number - or even a name - on his shirt, but a remarkable ten-over stint, costing just 12 runs, in century heat at Adelaide earned him a World Cup spot. There, he produced a matchwinning spell against Pakistan before a sobering last-over disaster against Australia."", ""Five wickets followed in the first innings of his debut Test, against Zimbabwe at home in 2003, then a one-day hat-trick against Pakistan, but his fortunes waned. For a couple of years Anderson was a peripheral net bowler as attempts to change his action to avoid injury affected his pace and rhythm. That oft-predicted stress fracture kept him out for most of 2006, but he still made the Australian tour and the World Cup. However, as England's 2005 Ashes-winning attack began to fall apart, Anderson made his second coming - starting in Wellington on the 2007-08 tour of New Zealand, where he and Stuart Broad were united for the first time. The same opponents were blown away at Trent Bridge (Anderson 7 for 43) a few weeks later, during a summer that earned Anderson the honour of being named among Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year. He marked the award, given at the start of the 2009 season, by making the West Indians looked clueless at Chester-le-Street (nine wickets in the match)."", 'In 2010 Anderson came of age in a staggeringly comprehensive fashion. No longer content with being unplayable when the mood caught him, he took the decision to shelve the ""magic balls"" and concentrated on hammering out a rock-solid line and length, with dot balls and maidens his new holy grail. The upshot was a scintillating year in which he proved unhittable in every sense, with an economy rate that ramped up the pressure in every spell, and a range of weapons that made him a threat on every surface. ', 'A career-best 11-wicket haul against Pakistan at Trent Bridge, when he came as close to unplayable as at any time in his career, was the prelude to a breakthrough tour of Australia in the winter of 2010-11. Anderson arrived to a torrent of doubters, who recalled his forlorn performance on the preceding Ashes four years earlier, in which he had taken five wickets at 82.60. But he left with a series-sealing 24 scalps at 26.04, and a reputation transformed. ', 'Deadly with conventional swing and seam, and with a new line in reverse swing as well, he had become arguably the most complete fast bowler in the world. He was awarded the Freedom of Burnley - his home town - in 2012, which was also his benefit year, and also eased past Brian Statham\'s 252 Test wickets to become Lancashire\'s most successful England bowler. His increased range was demonstrated in India the following winter, when Anderson claimed 12 wickets at 30.25 but was described by MS Dhoni as ""the major difference between the two sides"".', ""In 2013, fittingly at Lord's, a ground where enjoyed much success, he became the fourth England bowler to reach 300 Test wickets when he had Peter Fulton caught at slip. When he began the Ashes with a match-winning 10-wicket haul at Trent Bridge his form showed no signs of abating, but the following nine Tests against Australia were far less successful as a chastened England returned home after the battering down under in 2013-14."", ""Anderson took 37 wickets in seven Tests against Sri Lanka and India in 2014, but his reputation was sullied by a verbal confrontation in the first Test at Trent Bridge with India's Ravindra Jadeja and accusations of pushing and shoving on the way in the dressing room corridor. India insisted that his behaviour had become unacceptable, but the resulting ICC investigation could not separate the truth from the lies and both men got off lightly. The World Cup in the antipodes was another unhappy episode, as the curtain came down on Anderson's 194-game ODI career - another format in which he was England's leading wicket-taking exponent - after an ignominious group-stage exit."", ""By then, England's Test bowling records were bound to fall his way. He passed Botham's record Test-wicket haul in the Caribbean and shortly afterwards reached 400 against New Zealand at Headingley. His fitness remained exemplary, his action as rhythmical as ever, and his appetite still powerful enough to imagine, as he passed his 33rd birthday, playing for another five years. A northern spring, Sri Lanka the opposition, cheered him with three five-wicket hails in successive Tests in Leeds and Chester-le-Street in 2016, but a shoulder injury marred his summer and he was innocuous on Indian pitches as England slumped to a 4-0 defeat that winter. "", ""The 500-mark beckoned, however, and a fit-again Anderson averaged 14.10 during the home series against South Africa and West Indies. He was the pick of the attack as England were crushed in Australia yet again, and continued to rule the roost at home. When he bowled Mohammed Shami to complete England's 4-1 win over India and record his 564th Test wicket, McGrath's pace-bowling record was eclipsed - and there were tears on the outfield from Anderson, as he contemplated the retirement of his great mate Alastair Cook."", ""That Anderson's left-hand batting has also steadily improved from his early days as a fully paid-up rabbit was illustrated when he struck 81 against India in 2014 - his maiden first-class fifty - as he shared a Test record stand of 198 for the tenth wicket with Joe Root in the first innings. He has served England with distinction as a nightwatchman on numerous occasions and went 54 Test innings before collecting a duck, an England record. At Cardiff in 2009 he survived for 69 nail-chewing minutes to help stave off defeat by Australia. He has also been an outstanding fielder, strikingly so for a fast bowler, lithe in the outfield and sharp in the catching positions."", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2002', 'Awarded the OBE in June 2015']",148.0,207.0,86.0,1174.0,81,9.7,2940.0,39.93,0.0,1.0,159.0,3.0,91.0,0.0,194.0,79,43,273.0,28,7.58,561,48.66,0,0,23,0,53.0,0.0,19.0,4,3,1.0,1*,1.00,2,50.0,0,0,0,0,3.0,0.0,239.0,308,124,1790,81,9.72,,,0,1,,,140.0,0.0,255.0,102,62,371,28,9.27,,,0,0,,,65.0,0.0,44.0,10,6,23,16,5.75,26,88.46,0,0,3,0,8.0,0.0,148.0,277,32335,15490,575.0,7/42,11/71,26.93,2.87,56.2,27,27,3,194.0,191,9584,7861,269.0,5/23,5/23,29.22,4.92,35.6,11,2,0,19.0,19,422,552,18.0,3/23,3/23,30.66,7.84,23.4,0,0,0,239.0,,48503,23446,920,7/42,,25.48,2.90,52.7,40,45,6,255.0,,12414,10003,352,5/23,5/23,28.41,4.83,35.2,11,2,0,44.0,44,933,1318,41,3/23,3/23,32.14,8.47,22.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

But, after building a reputation as an elegant batsman, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann. \n', 'While many critics dismissed him as a ""part-time"" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. He had also developed a doosra after working with his friend and sometimes Worcestershire teammate, Saeed Ajmal.', 'But it was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. He made an outstanding, unbeaten century in his second Test, at Headingley, as England went within two balls of saving the series and while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an England spinner in a Test, he struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling in his first three appearances.', ""That changed in training for the Lord's Test against India. Encouraged by team-mate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test offspinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an on-looker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight."", ""It was to prove a pivotal meeting. Moeen was tighter at Lord's, devastating in Southampton and excellent at Old Trafford as he finished the series with 19 wickets; the fourth highest haul any spinner had claimed against India in a Test series outside the subcontinent and the best since 1967 when Ray Illingworth bowled 30 more overs and claimed one more victim."", 'While he struggled to recapture his batting form in Test cricket, he took his chance when promoted to the top of the order in the ODI side by hitting a 72-ball century in Colombo and ended the year a regular in all formats.', 'He had looked destined for such success for some time. Signed by Warwickshire as a 15-year-old, he made a century on first-class debut against Cambridge MCCU (he remains the second-youngest man to score a first-class half-century for the club) and Championship debut against Nottinghamshire but was dropped for the next game on both occasions. He also captained England U-19s to the semi-final of the 2006 World Cup, blasted a 56-ball century in an U-19 Test against Sri Lanka and, as a 14-year-old, smashed 195 not out in a Twenty20 match for his under-15 club side Moseley Ashfield. The next highest score was 11.', ""But, frustrated by a lack of opportunity at Warwickshire during Mark Greatbatch's ill-fated reign as coach of the club, he left for local rivals Worcestershire at the end of 2006 and was a key part of the team that won the Pro-40 title in 2007. It included a 46-ball century against Northants in 2007; there had, at the time, been only one faster List A century made in England in matches involving two first-class counties."", ""There were setbacks. Trying to combat a tendency to nick off, he went through a period of batting like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and then a spell of leaving balls that hit his off stump instead. But he made 1270 runs at 47.03 in 2010 and 1375 runs at 62.50 in 2013 - the year he won the PCA's most valuable player award - as he augmented his flair with increased discipline outside off stump. And, all the time, he was working on his offspin, claiming 33 wickets at 29.00 in 2012 and 28 at 33.71 a later year."", 'It was enough to earn him an England call-up for the ODI series in the West Indies at the start of 2014 and the World T20 in Bangladesh a few weeks later.', ""His older brother, Kadeer, played for Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Leicestershire while their cousin, Kabir was once a team-mate of Moeen's at Worcestershire, and was the first of the family to play international cricket. "", 'Moeen\'s development had a significance beyond the playing field. Taking on the mantle of role-model for fellow British Asians - a sector of society that county cricket has not always encouraged as it might have done - he also talked eloquently of his Muslim faith and grew perhaps the most noticeable beard in English cricket since the days of WG Grace.

Shahzad has proven his worth time and again with a series of thrilling batting displays, often producing his own version of the helicopter shot, and his fearlessness at the crease makes him one of the few Associate batsmen capable of standing toe-to-toe against Full Member opposition. \n', ""Shahzad had yet to make his debut when Afghanistan's magic carpet ride took them from WCL Division Five in 2008 to three straight promotions up the Associate cricket ladder, but he proved to be a valuable addition to the squad at his maiden tournament, the 2009 World Cup Qualifier in South Africa. Needing a win in their final Super Eight match to secure ODI status for an initial four-year period, Shahzad struck 73 in a 21-run victory over Namibia. Afghanistan made that that cherished ODI status more permanent, with Shahzad at the forefront of the batting unit, most prominently in T20s. He has played a starring role in each of Afghanistan's World T20 Qualifier campaigns to secure four consecutive berths at the World T20, beginning in 2010, and he is far and away his country's career leading scorer in the format. "", ""Due to his adventurous strokeplay and the nature of Afghanistan's membership status, Shahzad has sometimes been unfairly stereotyped as a limited-overs specialist but he has an adaptable technique to play long-form cricket too. Eleven days after his 64* off 46 balls ensured a successful chase against Ireland in the 2010 World T20 Qualifier final, Shahzad engineered one of the greatest heists in first-class history, scoring a fourth-innings 214 not out to overhaul a target of 494 in a 2010 Intercontinental Cup match against Canada. "", ""The one blemish on Shahzad's ledger is linked to his weight, which has been a fluctuating concern under different management regimes. The short and stocky wicketkeeper received a major wake-up call when he was left out of Afghanistan's final 15-man squad for the 2015 World Cup on fitness grounds by then coach Andy Moles. The sting of missing Afghanistan's maiden appearance at the ICC's showpiece event in Australia and New Zealand spurred him on to a wondrous revival and at the end of 2016 he was named the ICC Associate & Affiliate Cricketer of the Year, the first Afghan to claim the honour. "", 'In January 2017, Shahzad achieved a rare feat of scoring two T20I half-centuries in a day, leading Afghanistan to victories over Oman and Ireland in the morning semi-final and evening final of the inaugural Desert T20 Challenge in Dubai. It would later emerge that in a drug test taken just days earlier, Shahzad tested positive for the banned substance Clenbuterol, which Shahzad claimed to have inadvertently ingested through his use of the weight-loss supplement Hydroxycut. After a provisional suspension started in April 2017, he was retroactively suspended for one year and became eligible to play again on January 17, 2018.

Honing his skills with endless sessions of tennis-ball cricket, he managed to begin training at Arshad Khan's academy in Peshawar and made his competitive debut against Rahim Yar Khan Cricket Association in Pakistan's erstwhile Cornelius Trophy in 2003, making 61 after having just met most of his team-mates. On a tour of India he caught Mike Gatting's eye with a century against a visiting MCC side. That brought him more valuable experience with MCC, for whom he made his first-class debut, and he went on to play a major role in Afghanistan's progress to the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in 2009. Nabi struck 58 against Scotland on one-day international debut and 102 in his first first-class game for Afghanistan, against a Zimbabwe XI."", ""Nabi has remained the backbone of the side that qualified for the World Twenty20 in 2010, 2012 and 2014 and, recently, the 2015 World Cup. Nabi has had a couple of stints as Afghanistan's captain, taking over the role from Nawroz Mangal in March 2013 and leading the side to the 2015 World Cup. He has overseen rapid changes in Afghanistan's cricket but has remained calmer than most. Nabi has also played club and domestic cricket in England, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where he has enjoyed varying success but has gained in experience.""]",[],2.0,4,0,25.0,24,6.25,52,48.07,0,0,4,0,2.0,0.0,111.0,99,11,2565.0,116,29.14,2942,87.18,1,13,159,83,50,0,68.0,63,10,1161.0,89,21.90,800,145.12,0,3,78,66,37.0,0.0,34.0,55,4,1276,117,25.01,2467,51.72,2,5,136,40,20,0,146.0,132,14,3569,146,30.24,3972,89.85,3,16,228,124,66.0,0.0,207.0,169,34,3060,89,22.66,2158,141.79,0,8,214,155,95.0,0.0,2.0,3,282,159,4.0,3/36,3/94,39.75,3.38,70.5,0,0,0,111.0,107,5279,3747,118.0,4/30,4/30,31.75,4.25,44.7,2,0,0,68.0,68,1432,1705,69.0,4/10,4/10,24.71,7.14,20.7,3,0,0,34.0,55,4584,2083,90,6/33,8/85,23.14,2.72,50.9,4,3,0,146.0,142,7080,4987,166,5/12,5/12,30.04,4.22,42.6,3,1,0,207.0,204,4148,4792,217,4/10,4/10,22.08,6.93,19.1,6,0,0,False,True,True,True

Little more than 6ft tall, with a smooth and athletic run-up, his fast arm surprises batsmen and he has a natural full-of-a-length delivery, swinging the ball both ways at pace. A reasonable tailender and with excellent hands in the outfield, Hassan - softly spoken yet fiercely ambitious - represents the talent which exists in Afghanistan. \n"", ""The match at Lord's was a significant step for a bowler whose family fled the bombs of Jalalabad when he was six, and who subsequently learned the game in Peshawar where thousands of his countrymen sought refuge. His family, all of whom hated the game, did their best to encourage education but Hassan's determination - he played the game in secret for years - eventually won them over. He was first spotted when playing for Afghanistan in March 2006 in Mumbai when they defeated an MCC side led by Mike Gatting, where the then MCC president, Robin Marlar, noticed his potential, and was stunned to see him bowling in flat trainers. Hasan toured England with the national side in 2006, playing several matches against county second XIs, winning them all and was drafted onto MCC's groundstaff where he bowled against his hero, Andrew Flintoff, and was quick enough to smash Monty Panesar's helmet in the nets."", 'He ventured north to play for Norden CC in the Central Lancashire League the following year and represented Afghanistan in the 2009 World Cup Qualifiers, where his whippy action on a corrugated pitch earned him his first five-wicket haul, helping his side upset the tournament favourites Ireland. His once apathetic family celebrated back home by sacrificing a lamb and handing it around the small village to poor people.', ""Although Afghanistan missed out on World Cup qualification, they earned ODI status and at their next qualifying event - for the World Twenty20 - Hassan's incisive death bowling and 12 wickets played an important part in their qualification for the tournament in the West Indies. It appears the only thing that might be able to limit Hassan's ambition is the frailty of his own body. In 2012 a knee injury necessitated two operations, and he missed out on the World T20 qualifying final against Ireland in 2013. When he's fit, he completes Afghanistan's varied bowling attack, and his pace, reverse swing and yorkers make him Associate cricket's most lethal bowler.""]",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,32.0,17,4,92.0,17,7.07,171,53.80,0,0,9,2,4,0,22.0,9,6,50.0,22,16.66,46,108.69,0,0,3,2,2.0,0.0,13.0,17,6,58,26,5.27,139,41.72,0,0,6,3,3,0,49.0,24,7,130,22,7.64,210,61.90,0,0,11,4,8.0,0.0,40.0,16,6,61,22,6.10,69,88.40,0,0,3,2,6.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,32.0,31,1518,1153,56.0,5/45,5/45,20.58,4.55,27.1,2,1,0,22.0,22,478,523,32.0,4/22,4/22,16.34,6.56,14.9,1,0,0,13.0,24,2500,1490,67,7/61,11/154,22.23,3.57,37.3,2,6,3,49.0,48,2378,1828,84,5/23,5/23,21.76,4.61,28.3,3,2,0,40.0,40,884,991,55,4/22,4/22,18.01,6.72,16.0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

Hamilton is a free-hitting middle-order batsman and in his earlier days was a springy, if inconsistent, swing bowler who is at home on the Headingley greentops but struggled on flatter wickets. He made the news with a series of top-drawer all-round performances for Yorkshire at the end of the 1998 season, and was Scotland's batting lynchpin during the 1999 World Cup. This earned him a place on England's tour of South Africa the following winter, but he scored a pair and failed to take a wicket in what will remain his only Test, at Johannesburg, and was ruthlessly dumped.  \n"", ""After a mandatory four-year wait, he was again picked for Scotland in the squad for the 2004 ECC European Championship and helped them qualify for the 2007 World Cup in West Indies. Following a county move from Yorkshire to Durham he suffered a bout of the yips, from which he never properly recovered his bowling. He ended his professional career in 2005 but continued to bring vital experience to the Scotland team. A long overdue maiden one-day international hundred came against Ireland in the summer of 2008, and he was a surprise successor to Ryan Watson as Scotland's captain after their side's poor show in the ICC World Cup Qualifiers the following year. He held the position until the summer of 2010, when he relinquished it to Gordon Drummond. A team man to the last, Hamilton announced his retirement later that season, not wanting to hold onto a position that would keep a younger player from developing and wanting to bow out while he was still a quality player for the national side."", '\n', ' August 2010']",[],1.0,2,0,0.0,0,0.0,9,0.00,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,38.0,38,3,1231.0,119,35.17,1847,66.64,2,7,95,11,6,1,12.0,8,0,90.0,32,11.25,110,81.81,0,0,6,1,3.0,0.0,95.0,133,21,2939,125,26.24,,,2,18,,,34,0,211.0,177,28,4209,131,28.24,,,4,22,,,43.0,1.0,18.0,14,2,194,41*,16.16,217,89.40,0,0,11,4,6.0,0.0,1.0,1,90,63,0.0,-,-,35.33,4.20,-,0,0,0,38.0,6,220,160,3.0,2/36,2/36,53.33,4.36,73.3,0,0,0,12.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,95.0,,12348,6415,249,7/50,,25.76,3.11,49.5,,9,2,211.0,,4124,3227,128,5/16,5/16,25.21,4.69,32.2,4,2,0,18.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

His 140 not out against a side ranked No 1 in the world in ODIs left England shaken and was regarded in Scotland - and for that matter in many places beyond - as suitable punishment for the ECB which had successfully lobbied for a 10-team World Cup on home soil in 2019 from which Scotland were excluded.  \n', ""His father (Cricket Scotland's photographer Donald MacLeod) did not even think it was his best Scotland innings, pointing instead to an unbeaten 157 against Afghanistan earlier in the year in a World Cup qualifier in Bulawayo, when he expertly dealt with the talented leg spinner Rashid Khan, liberally employing a sweep shot that he put down to his time spent playing hockey. "", ""Two centuries in succession for MacLeod in January 2014 - a 62-ball 113 against the UAE and 175 against Canada - played a major part in Scotland's qualification for the 2015 World Cup. In many ways MacLeod was a surprising poster boy for Scottish cricket. He has roots in the island of South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, from where his grandfather moved to Glasgow. When he acted as a substitute fielder for England in an Ashes Test in 2009 he became the first Gaelic speaker to appear in a Test - he was once banned from speaking Gaelic on the field because an umpire deemed it unfair to the other players."", ""MacLeod's hopes of forging a county career as a fast bowler fell apart in 2009 when his action was reported by the umpires after an Intercontinental Cup match. Remedial work followed, including sessions with the former South Africa quick Allan Donald, then bowling coach at Warwickshire, but he was released by the county in 2010. "", ""Nevertheless, hours spent watching the preparations of Warwickshire's England duo, Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, proved to be of benefit. Cricket Scotland had introduced player contracts at the end of 2008, and gradually MacLeod, who had briefly wondered about taking up hockey, surprised everyone by forcing his way into the side as a batsman."", ""Paul Collingwood, who was added to Scotland's coaching ranks as they qualified for the World Cup, was so impressed that Durham gave him a contract on Collingwood's advice.

Returning from that short trip, he was viewed as a better bowler and slowly picked up more variations. He initially lacked pace but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets at an average of 19.08. "", ""This was when Mustafizur started to develop the left-armer's offcutter, which was delivered as a spinner does but with the added ability of making it carry to the wicketkeeper standing back. The story of Anamul Haque's dare that got him to bowl the delivery will go into Bangladeshi cricket folklore, as will the early support he received from Mashrafe Mortaza, who spotted him randomly in the Mirpur nets."", ""Soon enough, the Bangladesh selectors picked Mustafizur for the one-off T20I against Pakistan and then, midway through 2015, for the ODI series against India when he became only the second bowler after Brian Vitori to take five-wicket hauls in his first two ODIs, paving the way for Bangladesh's first-ever ODI series win over India."", ""He was excellent in bilateral series against South Africa - which included a Test debut - and Zimbabwe, while also doing well in his first BPL campaign. Mustafizur's first foray on to the world stage was through the IPL auction, when he was picked Sunrisers Hyderabad in early 2016, followed by confirmation of a contract with Sussex for English domestic limited-overs cricket. He ensured none of his new paymasters doubted their call as he emerged as one of the best bowlers in the World T20, signing off with a five-wicket haul against New Zealand, bamboozling them with his variation of cutters.

Mushfiqur was principally selected as an understudy to the ever-present wicketkeeper, Khaled Mashud, but his inclusion was further evidence of Bangladesh's determination to build for a better future. He had done well on an A-team tour of Zimbabwe earlier in 2005, scoring a century in the first Test at Bulawayo, and also enjoyed some success in England the previous year with the Under-19s, making 88 in the second Test at Taunton. He showed more evidence of grit with the full team, with a maiden first-class half-century to soften the pain of defeat against Sussex, followed by a career-best 115 against Northamptonshire. That earned him a call-up - as a batsman - to become the youngest player to appear in a Test match at Lord's. He was one of only three players to reach double figures in a disappointing first innings, but a twisted ankle kept him out of the second Test. After captaining Bangladesh's Under-19s to fifth place in the Youth World Cup in February 2006, he also featured in Bogra's inaugural Test, against Sri Lanka the following month, but could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara. He remained on the sidelines for the next few months but was recalled for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe at home in December.

He has under-performed as a batsman in ODIs, but his form picked up in 2009 and he narrowly missed out on a maiden ODI hundred on the tour to Zimbabwe. In January 2010 he cracked his maiden Test century, a notable achievement as it came against a strong Indian Test side and was the fastest by a Bangladesh player.

As long as you enjoy the highlight reel of his career, everything seems rosy: whether it was in becoming the youngest Test centurion in 2001, the unbeaten 158 against India in 2004, the magnificent 100 he made against Australia in Cardiff in 2005 triggering a huge upset, or the innovative 87 against South Africa in the 2007 World Cup, Ashraful provided the entertainment quotient that turned heads towards Bangladesh. When he made a comeback in 2013 after being dropped due to poor form, he made 190 against Sri Lanka.\n \nBut one look at the overall numbers, and it is easy to realise why some of his fans have given up on him. The fact that he has a score of 50 or more roughly 15% of the time he has batted in international cricket is one of those markers, like his batting average, that pulls him down as a batsman. Is it easy to say that he has underachieved, but those who have dealt with him over the years think otherwise, as they have been surprised by his own lack of confidence in his immense talent.', ""His rise from the outskirts of Dhaka to cricket's wonderboy has been well documented. He trained under Wahidul Gani, a dedicated coach who ran his academy in Dhanmondi, before making his club debut for Amorjyoti. After warming the benches for the star-studded Surjo Tarun in the Dhaka Premier League in 2000-01, he made it to the Bangladesh team on the back of a lot of promise and because the selectors were too focused on youth."", 'After his 2007 World Cup performance, the media wanted to see their golden boy take to captaincy, but it didn\'t work out well. He immediately fell further as a batsman in his two-year stint that also saw the loss of players to the Indian Cricket League in 2008. There were allegations of him being willing to play in the rebel league. He lost his captaincy to Mashrafe Mortaza after his affinity for a dab past the wicketkeeper cost Bangladesh a game against Ireland in the 2009 World Twenty20. And as the team started to have more performers, he lost his place regularly in the next few years. However, in March 2013, he made 190 against Sri Lanka in the Galle Test, an evolved innings which earned fulsome praise.\n \nHowever, just when it seemed it was all going to change for Ashraful, he was hauled up by the ICC\'s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit into alleged spot-fixing claims during the season\'s BPL.

He was sent to a camp conducted by West Indian great Andy Roberts, who proclaimed that Mashrafe had a great future. The selectors fast-tracked his growth and within a few months, during which he played four games for Bangladesh A in India, the young man from far-off Narail took the new-ball against visiting Zimbabwe. Soon it was clear that he had what it takes: Mashrafe was making the likes of Grant Flower jump around due to his pace, a first for a Bangladeshi fast bowler."", 'But another thing was also clear to those who observed him - his rickety bowling action. Feet and arms landed in the wrong arcs, and soon the injuries set in. And that has been the story of his career. Mashrafe has missed more games for Bangladesh than he has played ever since his 2001 debut.

But he made up the following year when his four-wicket haul destroyed India in the 2007 World Cup game at Port-of-Spain. Mashrafe's early strikes have always helped Bangladesh, none more so than in the 2009 tri-series final when he and Nazmul Hossain sunk Sri Lanka to a new low - six runs for five wickets.

As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams. \n', 'The best of his ability and temperament were on display in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, when Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. In only his fourth Test as captain, Shakib scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton, performances that offered further proof of his skill and ability to handle pressure. Against the same opponents in 2008, Shakib took 7 for 36 in Chittagong, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking seven or more wickets in a Test innings.', ""In ODIs, Shakib's contributions have been equally vital with bat and ball and he became the first from Bangladesh to achieve the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. He also became the first batsman from Bangladesh to score five hundreds, despite mostly batting at No. 5."", ""Being clearly the best player in the team, it wasn't surprising when Shakib was handed the captaincy in 2009 after Mashrafe Mortaza repeatedly got injured during his first tenure. His ability to perform consistently and to stay calm under pressure worked well for Bangladesh, as they won 22 out of 47 games under him, and even beat England in the 2011 World Cup. However, the World Cup campaign was followed by a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a one-off Test and the ODI series, which led to Shakib's removal as captain."", 'His form hardly waned, however, as he quickly bounced back to help Bangladesh bowl out West Indies for 61 in an ODI; a hundred and five-for in the same Test - something he has done twice - followed later in the year. He remained consistent for Bangladesh and his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders, but in 2014 Shakib lapsed into off-field shenanigans that saw him fined for lewdly gesticulating at the camera from the dressing-room during an ODI against Sri Lanka, then suspended for six months by the BCB for misbehaving with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and threatening to quit Bangladesh duty. The ban was lifted early and Shakib made the vice-captain in the ODI and T20 formats under Mashrafe. His match-winning ability was undimmed and he played key roles in Bangladesh wins during their stellar 2015.

His whole approach to the game has a Caribbean flavour to it. A middle-order batsman who relies on his eye as much as technique and who can attack or defend as the situation demands, he possesses a wide range of strokes, but when he is in full flow he can be a punishing player at any level. His bowling has gone from being medium-pace to a Chris Gayle-like gentle offspin, seemingly innocuous but deceptively effective in the one-day game.  It almost goes without saying that he had led Kenya in the post Maurice Odumbe era, and has done so by example. \n"", ""Coming from a famous cricketing family (older brother Tom is a former national captain and another brother David played at the 1996 World Cup), he was immediately at home on the international stage, when Kenya made their World Cup debut in 1996.  He made 65 in their first game, against India at Cuttack, top-scored with a vital 29 in their sensational low-scoring victory over West Indies at Pune,  and contributed 96 against Sri Lanka at Kandy, establishing himself as his country's leading batsman.  This was further shown when he made a destructive 147 against Bangladesh in the 1997 ICC Trophy final, taking Kenya to a second successive World Cup, and new ODI status.  "", ""He again performed well in the 1999 World Cup, with fifties against India and England, and on taking over the captaincy in 2002 he immediately underlined his class by scoring 93 and 69 in that year's Champions Trophy. While he had a personally disappointing start to the World Cup in 2003, he came good with the bat and his contributions with the ball and astute captaincy helped Kenya to reach the semi-finals."", ""This performance, aided by Tikolo's burgeoning reputation, led to calls for Kenya to be granted Test status, but those coincided with a rapid disintegration of the game inside the country as the KCA fell out with the stakeholders.  After a wretched 2004 Champions Trophy, Tikolo quit as captain, weary from 18 months of battling his own board, and he was at the heart of a players' strike which followed and which, eventually, helped lead to the ousting of the old regime.

He made his international debut for Ireland as a 17-year-old in 2010. The accolade was made more remarkable by the fact that he had only been bowling spin for four years, having switched from bowling seam at the age of 13 after coach Brian O'Rourke spotted him bowling spin in a car park during an Ireland age group tour of Wales.  \n"", ""Dockrell immediately established himself as a key player in the Ireland side. He played a key role in Ireland's 2010 World Twenty20 campaign, blending nous with audacity as his flighted twirlers saw off Netherlands in the qualifying tournament before taking 3 for 16 against West Indies and choking England's middle-order with four overs for 19. School exams then prevented him facing Australia in an ODI but a month later he was offered a contract at Somerset, where he had had an association since the age of 15."", ""He made a big impact in just his second County Championship match, taking 6 for 27 to bowl Somerset to victory over Middlesex in their opening fixture of the 2012 season. He helped his side to another win later in the year with 6 for 29 against Durham as Somerset's finished runners-up again. He finished the season with 35 wickets at 28.45 but future seasons proved less successful and the Somerset coach at the time, Dave Nosworthy, suggested that his red-ball game was suffering through a surfeit of white ball cricket. Matt Maynard, Nosworthy's successor, seemed of similar mind, and Dockrell was released at the end of 2015 - ahead of a busy Ireland one-day summer the following year."", ""In 2012 he played in his second World T20 but after three overs of punishment in a bad-tempered defeat to Australia, Ireland's final group match was washed out and Dockrell didn't get a second chance to bowl. But his year ended on a better note when he was named the ICC Associate Player of the Year in 2012. A year later he booked his ticket back to the world stage by helping Ireland win the World T20 qualifier for Bangladesh 2014. That he was cramming in experience at a young age was further emphasised when Ireland qualified for the 2015 World Cup, but the prospect of a 10-team World Cup in England in 2019 left him as just one of many Ireland players with a sense of betrayal."", 'Dockrell learned his game at Leinster Cricket Club in Dublin and played age-group cricket for Ireland since Under-13s. He made his senior debut in 2010: a T20 against Afghanistan in Colombo, where he took 2 for 11; an ODI debut followed in the West Indies. He also captained Ireland Under-19s at the 2012 World Cup. All the while he has not neglected his education, and is studying general science at Trinity College, Dublin.

Joyce had switched to England when the 2007 World Cup took place, having helped Irelands through the qualifying tournament, and became the first Irishman in the modern game to play for England. But he did not quite achieve the career he had envisaged and switched back to Ireland just in time for the next tournament in 2011. He had not quite achieved the four-year qualification period, but the ICC recognised a persuasive case and gave him special dispensation.  \n', 'Joyce was born in Dublin, and from a large family with four brothers and four sisters. He was a star for Ireland at ICC Trophy level, scoring 758 runs in 14 matches between 2001 and 2005, at an average of 84.22. But he always had ambitions to play at the highest level and, after completing his English residency qualification in 2005, made his one-day debut against Ireland in 2006. The Irish team included his younger brother, Dominick. Two days later, he represented England in his first Twenty20 International, before missing a month with a sprained ankle. International cricket, though, had whet his appetite and upon his Championship return for Middlesex at Edgbaston he struck a career-best 211 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.', ""He seemed to cement his England place with good performances in Australia - the highlight being a century against Australia at the SCG and then against lesser opponents in the 2007 World Cup, although questions began to be raised about his fluency and he was discarded after England's dismal tournament. Joyce was an important part of Middlesex's middle-order for a decade from his debut in 1999, but his frustration at a stalled England career was evident and after an unhappy 2008 he severed his ties with Middlesex and moved south to Sussex where he became an influential member of the side without ever regaining his England place. "", ""He became Sussex captain in the middle of the 2012 season, succeeding Michael Yardy. He had an exceptional summer in 2014, hitting seven centuries and averaging 66 in the Division One of the Championship, outdone only by Yorkshire's Adam Lyth among regular performers.  The England selector Angus Fraser even suggested that, were Joyce still eligible, he would have been seriously considered as Alastair Cook's opening partner in the Test side. He resigned after Sussex were surprisingly relegated in 2015, leaving Luke Wright to pick up the role in all three formats. The advent of first-class cricket in Ireland left him unsure of his Sussex future at the end of 2016, a season in which he set a new career-best with a masterful 250 against Derbyshire in Derby."", ""An oddity in Joyce's career was a rare form of dismissal in a Championship game against Warwickshire in 2009 when he swept a ball from Ant Botha straight into the pocket of the fielder at short leg, Jonathan Trott, who was leaping to take evasive action at the time."", 'Once Joyce recognised his England career was over, without the Test debut he had craved, he made clear his intentions to return to an international career with Ireland. He was named in an Irish pre-World Cup touring squad in October 2010 - more than five years after his last outing for Ireland - and shortly afterwards was granted special dispensation by the ICC to represent his country of birth at the tournament in February 2011. He explained that he had been driven to qualify for England by his desire to play Test cricket - ""the pinnacle of the game"" - but that as a ""born and bred Irishman"" he was eager to contribute to Ireland\'s success if that chance of Test cricket eluded him.', ""He is one of five members of the Joyce family to represent Ireland.

A positive captain who led from the front, he had little problem motivating his side - as demonstrated when Ireland bounced back from a disappointing World Cricket League in Kenya, where they finished 5th, to demolish the United Arab Emirates and qualify for the final of the Intercontinental Cup. He tore the heart out of the UAE batting line up in their second innings taking three for eight from his eight overs as Ireland recorded a morale-boosting victory by an innings and 170 runs. He led Ireland to a thrilling tie against Zimbabwe in their first match of the 2007 World Cup before beating Pakistan - Johnston hit the winning runs - to record one of the biggest upsets in history. \n"", ""In March 2008, at the age of 34, Johnston announced that he was taking an indefinite break from international cricket in order to recuperate and spend some time with his family, but returned for Ireland's Intercontinental Cup match against Canada five months later and was a vital member of the side - captained by William Porterfield - that reached its third successive Cup final. "", ""In April 2009 Johnston's career-best figures of 5 for 14 set up Ireland's win over Canada in the final of the ICC World Cup Qualifiers, and later that year he came within a whisker of securing the first Irish victory over England with a fine allround display as he ripped through the top order with four wickets and then hit an unbeaten 20 that couldn't quite get Ireland home.

His pace is lively without being express but he has become a valued member of Middlesex's attack - and one of the most reliable new-ball bowlers on the county circuit. He can also be a destructive lower order hitter. \n"", ""Though now a stalwart at Lord's, he actually came through Surrey's age-group sides and was a member of the England Under-19 squad during the 1999 World Cup, subsequently touring Sri Lanka with a British Universities side in 2002. He battled his way into the Surrey side, and in 2005 took a competition-best 6 for 24 in a Twenty20 tie against Middlesex at Lord's. Nevertheless, he moved north of the river to Lord's in 2007 where he felt his opportunities would be greater. And they were. Consistent in all forms of cricket, and with a liking for the big occasion, he took 104 wickets in all three formats in 2008 and began to establish himself as a county stalwart. Surprisingly, he was overlooked for the England development squad, but had his chance to shine in Middlesex's trip to Antigua for the Stanford 20/20 for 20.

His withdrawal from the 2015 World Cup because of a foot injury suffered in a training session in Dubai denied him the opportunity he had cherished and he also missed out on a potential appearance in World Twenty20 in India in 2016, this time of his own volition, when he retired from T20 internationals early in the 2015 season. "", ""While his appearances for Ireland were primarily in limited-overs cricket, Middlesex increasingly regarded saving him for first-class cricket as the best use of him. He was yet again Middlesex's leading Championship wicket-take in 2014, with 58 wickets, including ten wickets in the match against Durham.

His skill was highlighted in Ireland's famous victory over England in Bangalore at the 2011 World Cup. Mooney took 4 for 63 in England's innings, restricting the batsmen at the death with cutters, yorkers and slower balls. But his contribution with the bat was even more significant. Mooney was clinical in clinching Ireland's win, finishing with 33 not out from 30 balls and hitting the winnings runs when he clipped Jimmy Anderson to the midwicket boundary.  \n"", ""Mooney made his ODI debut alongside his older brother Paul in Ireland's maiden ODI, against England in June 2006. He contributed with bat and ball, claiming the wickets of Marcus Trescothick, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood - though he conceded 79 from his ten overs - and then hit an unbeaten 30. But he was a peripheral player for Ireland in the 2007 World Cup, going wicketless in his two games. After the tournament, he took a break from international cricket to complete his electrical apprenticeship, but returned when he was qualified and was established as a regular in the Ireland team by the World Cup. "", ""In April 2013 he was suspended for three matches by Cricket Ireland for an insensitive tweet about the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The following February he left Ireland's tour of the West Indies and took a break from the game due a stress-related illness which had been managed for some time. In a highly revealing interview in September 2014, Mooney admitted the extent of his struggle with depression, saying that he had even contemplated committing suicide. The following day he made a sublime 96 against Scotland, marked by crisp late cuts, and the Malahide crowd were distraught that he just missed out on a maiden ODI century. But more important was that Mooney was enjoying cricket again and had proved his continuing worth in the Ireland side ahead of the 2015 World Cup. "", ""While Mooney's skills seem particularly well-suited to limited overs cricket he has also been a terrific performer for Ireland in the first-class game, and took match figures of 10 for 81 as Ireland beat Afghanistan in the final of the Intercontinental Cup in 2013.

After Nicky Boje relinquished the captaincy and Andrew Hall took up the position, O'Brien was named as his deputy. He was stripped of the position and banned from the team, however, for a breach of team disciplinary rules in June 2010. Although he was subsequently cleared at a disciplinary hearing and restored to the squad he no longer held the position of vice-captain and a fractured finger kept him out of action for most of the season. "", ""Despite continuing to perform consistently - he averaged 35.72 in first-class cricket for Northants - O'Brien moved to Leicestershire at the start of the 2013 season on a three-year contract, where his experience brought solidity to a vulnerable batting line-up. In 2014 he scored 971 first-class runs, his highest tally in an English season. He retired from county cricket at the end of 2016 as his 35th birthday approached and took up a career opportunity in talent management. Although he planned to settle in Leicestershire, he had plans to play for Leinster Lightning in the new first-class competition scheduled for 2017 and did not retire from international cricket."", ""The son of Brendan, a former Ireland captain, Niall has played alongside Kevin, his younger brother for Ireland. But he played in the Bangladesh Premier League, against Cricket Ireland's wishes, at the start of 2012. He was left out of the subsequent World T20 Qualifiers and, when he regained his place in the side, found that he had been usurped by Gary Wilson behind the stumps and has yet to regain the gloves. "", ""A confident character and batsman, O'Brien's combative nature earned him a one-match ban after an outburst at officials during an Intercontinental Cup game with Scotland. The Dubliner also managed to incense Brian Lara when Ireland defeated the West Indies in 2004, in which he made 58. Lara, in O'Brien's eyes, had been caught at the wicket, but chose not to walk.\n"", '\n']",[],1.0,2,0,18.0,18,9.0,55,32.72,0,0,2,0,2.0,0.0,103.0,101,9,2581.0,109,28.05,3638,70.94,1,18,218,30,90.0,14.0,30.0,28,2,466.0,50,17.92,475,98.1,0,1,40,7,17,10,176.0,283,28,9057,182,35.51,16371,55.32,15,48,,,492.0,48.0,238.0,214,26,5700,121,30.31,7364,77.40,4,36,,,210.0,44.0,147.0,127,18,2329,84,21.36,2091,111.38,0,5,203,41,82,35,1.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,103.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,30.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,176.0,,18,19,2,1/4,1/4,9.50,6.33,9.0,0,0,0,238.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,147.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

While Ireland have been disappointed by their lack of opportunities - they played fewer ODIs against Full Members from 2011 to 2015 than 2007 to 2011 - O'Brien has remained a formidable cricketer for them, and hit 84* from 47 balls to secure a tie against Pakistan in 2013.

Blessed with great height - Rankin is six feet, seven inches tall - he gained bounce from even the most sluggish of surfaces and claimed 12 wickets in the tournament to help his side to notable victories over Pakistan and Bangladesh. Five years later, he made himself unavailable for Ireland in a bid to play Test cricket with England. The move provoked disquiet in his home country but it appeared to have been justified when he was named in England's Ashes squad to tour Australia in 2013-14, after a series of impressive limited-overs displays for his adoptive country. Progress was fitful, though, and he restored his allegiance with Ireland as 2015 drew to a close. \n"", ""Having spent some time on the staff at Middlesex without ever making it into the first team, Rankin broke into the Derbyshire side on the back of his World Cup success and then moved to Warwickshire at the end of the 2007 season. Hampered by a succession of injuries, it wasn't until 2009 that, having put greater onus on strength and fitness, he began to fulfil his potential. In 2011 he was part of the Ireland side that defeated England in the World Cup game in Bangalore and then passed 50 first-class wickets in a county season for the first time. After one particularly hostile spell in which he struck Marcus Trescothick several times on the body, the Somerset opener praised Rankin for being as good a fast bowler as he faced that season. While consistency and fitness remained an issue, there was little doubt that, when the force was with him, Rankin had the pace, bounce and lateral movement to discomfort any batsman."", 'Rankin made his England Lions debut in 2011 against Sri Lanka A and was selected on the England Performance Programme later that same year.

Having struggled to remain injury free, it was made clear to him that his body could not sustain the burden of playing all formats of the game for Ireland, Warwickshire and England Lions. It was also made clear to him by his then club coach, Ashley Giles, that he would not be guaranteed another county contract unless he committed to Warwickshire and England.', 'After impressing at the start of 2013, Rankin was called into the England squad for the ODI series against New Zealand following injuries to Stuart Broad and Steven Finn. In June that year he played his first game for England, a Twenty20 international against New Zealand. His England ODI debut followed shortly after, ironically in Dublin, where Rankin took a career-best 4 for 46 against his former country, and his returns during the one-day series with Australia were good enough to win him a place in the Ashes squad.', 'The tour did not go as he would have wished. Overlooked until the final Test, Rankin delivered a nervous performance on Test debut that raised questions about both his temperament and the environment within the England squad. He later revealed that he played the game carrying an injury. He was subsequently omitted from England World T20 squad, but thrown a lifeline latter in the year when he was recalled to the Lions squad for the tour of South Africa.

Before his 23rd birthday, he had already hit two ODI centuries against Pakistan. With a natural swagger and belligerence allied to a portly build, Stirling has evoked comparisons with Jesse Ryder. He generates huge power with seemingly little effort and is particularly strong lashing the ball straight or pulling the ball over midwicket.  \n', ""Born in Belfast, Stirling made his ODI debut at the age of just 17. He played for Ireland in the World Twenty20 in England in 2009, and then signed a three-year contract with Middlesex in December 2009. The following year he gave further notice of his talent by thumping a 134-ball 177 for Ireland against Canada in Toronto - the highest ODI score made by an Irishman. While he struggled in the 2011 World Cup, he ended the tournament with 101 in Ireland's victory against the Netherlands, and a century in Ireland's ODI series against Pakistan in May 2011 had Waqar Younis purring. He added another against the same opponents in Ireland's tie with Pakistan two years later. Stirling also revealed his big match temperament with a pair of blistering innings - 79 off 38 balls and 76 off 43 balls - against Afghanistan in the finals of the World T20 qualifiers in 2012 and 2013. "", ""While Stirling made a fine impression for Middlesex in limited overs cricket, he languished in the second eleven in the Championship. But when he got a chance in 2014, he averaged 43.87 in six games, suggesting that he was capable of managing the transition between the white and red ball. Although he has been troubled by a back injury, which has limited his ability to bowl, Stirling is also a highly competent back-up offspinner. He has frequently bowled his full allocation of overs for Ireland in ODIs and, with 1-45 from ten overs, was Ireland's most economical bowled during their victory over England in Bangalore in the 2011 World Cup."", 'Stirling had long been a curious case in first-class cricket. The discrepancy between his first-class and limited overs returns for Middlesex had been infuriating. Before his maiden Championship hundred, he averaged 27.77 for the county against the red ball, but 41.46 in one-day cricket. So that century, against Yorkshire at Lord\'s in 2017, was a perfect celebration of Ireland\'s elevation to Test status which was formally confirmed on the other side of the Thames, at The Oval, a few days later. ""It\'s about time I did this and also about time I started to score more consistently. That said, I don\'t want to take away my natural instinct to play attacking cricket.

His selection was initially viewed with suspicion by the local media, who regarded Aftab as something of a one-day cowboy, and indeed his desire to belt the cover off the ball has resulted in some all-too-brief performances. His potential, however, is plain to see, and his selection for the seminal tour of England early in 2005 was evidence of the selectors' faith, which he repaid at Chester-le-Street with a defiant, carefree 82 not out, the highest score for Bangladesh in the Test series. He also finished off the historic one-day win over Australia at Cardiff, smashing Jason Gillespie for four and six to seal victory. His medium-pacers have potential as well, as he showed with an astonishing one-day haul of 5 for 31 against New Zealand in November 2004. He led Bangladesh to a 3-2 series victory with an unbeaten 81 in the final match against Zimbabwe in January 2005. Since then, barring that run-a-ball 82 at the Riverside, he's hit a lean patch: he hasn't reached 30 in a Test, while in one-dayers he hit a couple of fifties against the Kenyans early in 2006, but failed to impress against Australia. On the tours of Zimbabwe and Kenya in August, Aftab delighted everyone with his all-out attack attitude but often threw it away when he promised so much more. He struck five fifties in eleven innings against Zimbabwe and Scotland since the Champions Trophy in October but a century still eludes him. He reached a career best of 92 against Zimbabwe in February 2007. However, his international career was put on hold when he joined the Bangladesh exodus to the rebel Indian Cricket League and was banned for ten years. After one season, he quit the ICL and made himself available for selection again. His first assignment after his recall was the tri-series at home in January 2010.

A naturally talented allrounder, he had never been seriously coached until joining up with the Dutch squad. Borren earned that nickname 'Baldrick' from his team-mates - after the character in Blackadder - and is a chirpy presence in the field. Although his medium pace was taken apart on his ODI debut against Sri Lanka, as he picked up 1 for 94 from his 10 overs, his performances in the World Cricket League in Kenya where he averaged 21.25 in his three games proved enough to earn him a place at the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean. In the same year Borren showed his allround ability when he narrowly missed out on a maiden one-day international hundred, getting out stumped for 96 against Canada in Toronto. That confident innings must surely have owed something to Netherlands' thrilling last-ball win over England in the opening match of the ICC World Twenty20 at Lord's a month before. Borren played an important role in that famous win, snapping up the wicket of Eoin Morgan and then cracking a 25-ball 30 that included a monstrous six off Paul Collingwood in the course of a 50-run partnership with Tom de Grooth that tilted the game for Netherlands. In January 2010 Borren was part of the first group of Netherlands players to be awarded central contracts - a vital step in the professionalisation of the game at Associate level - and was appointed captain of the national side for the World Cricket League Division One tournament in July 2010."", '\n', ' \n']",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,58.0,50,5,1004.0,96,22.31,1176,85.37,0,5,84,19,28.0,0.0,43.0,38,5,638.0,57,19.33,524,121.75,0,1,60,18,28,0,27.0,50,1,1331,109,27.16,2239,59.44,2,5,151,17,40.0,0.0,153.0,136,20,2746,115,23.67,3235,84.88,2,12,232,53,72.0,0.0,63.0,55,10,863,57,19.17,721,119.69,0,1,72,26,38,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,58.0,51,1979,1620,46.0,4/32,4/32,35.21,4.91,43.0,1,0,0,43.0,30,526,603,18.0,2/19,2/19,33.50,6.87,29.2,0,0,0,27.0,41,3197,1652,41,4/1,4/1,40.29,3.10,77.9,1,0,0,153.0,124,4575,3888,106,4/32,4/32,36.67,5.09,43.1,1,0,0,63.0,49,832,956,31,3/14,3/14,30.83,6.89,26.8,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Most notable in a long-standing career were two centuries at the 2011 World Cup, including an exhilarating 119 that almost stunned England. Reflecting his dominance, he won the ICC Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year Award three times between 2008 and 2011. Ten Doeschate also played five years for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL - the first Associate player to gain such a contract. \n', 'Born in South Africa, ten Doeschate cited Jonty Rhodes as his hero, and has played for Western Province. He is of Dutch descent, though, enabling him to represent Netherlands and qualify under the European Citizenship law to play county cricket. With his huge hitting, skiddy bowling and big smile, he soon became a cult figure at Essex, where he has played for more than a decade. ', 'The rise in Twenty20 leagues around the world came at a particularly good time for ten Doeschate. His combination of belligerent hitting, particularly to the leg side, and canny medium-pace have earned lucrative contracts not only in the IPL but also in Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe. But after the 2011 World Cup, ten Doeschate appeared to lose interest in playing for the Netherlands, missing the 2012 and 2014 World Twenty20s.', ""Ten Doeschate's first-class batting average is in the high 40s and if he has cause for disappointment it is that his bowling has not developed as much as he would have liked, but whatever his achievements in the longer form of the game, he will always be viewed as a Twenty20 specialist. There were few players more immediately suited to the advent of the shorter form of the game and he invites the question how many more T20 stars exist beyond the main Test nations. "", 'Essex spotted ten Doeschate playing for Western Province on a tour of South Africa in 2003. For a time, Gooch was his regular airport runner so he could play club cricket in Holland at a weekend. The following season, the second season of T20 in England, he signed full professional forms and gradually proved himself one of the finest Essex players of his era.', 'Success for Essex was frustratingly evasive during his career, and he was in the later stages of his career when he was appointed captain in succession to James Foster in 2016. Alongside a new coach, Chris Silverwood, he immediately led Essex back into Division One of the Championship, leading by example by averaging 64 with the bat with four hundreds and suitably scoring the runs that won promotion. He accepted a new two-year contract as he looked forward to first division life.', 'At 37, Essex finally brought fulfilment as he led them to their first Championship for 25 years - and first-ever, incidentally, without his old chauffeur, Gooch. Ten Doeschate suggested Essex had killed the ""myth"" that there was a huge gap between Divisions One and Two and remarked that ""people make too much of a deal about cricket captaincy."" But alongside the coaching pair of Silverwood and Anthony McGrath he built a culture at Essex that landed a punch for the smaller, non-Test counties. By then he could call himself ""Essex through and through"" and not hear a murmur of dissent.', 'Essex failed to defend their title, but at least ten Doeschate had the satisfaction of spearheading a victory in the last match of the 2018 season to prevent Surrey going unbeaten through the season, his unbeaten half-century bringing a nerve-tingling one-wicket victory that showed the Championship could still provide moments of high drama.', '\n']","['ICC Associate Player of the Year 2008, 2010, ']",0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,33.0,32,9,1541.0,119,67.0,1757,87.70,5,9,130,29,13.0,0.0,13.0,13,6,300.0,56,42.85,229,131.0,0,1,15,10,4,0,174.0,256,38,10283,259*,47.16,,,27,48,,,110.0,0.0,219.0,183,55,5826,180,45.51,,,11,30,,,67.0,0.0,332.0,294,66,6677,121*,29.28,4944,135.05,2,28,412,283,123,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,33.0,33,1580,1327,55.0,4/31,4/31,24.12,5.03,28.7,3,0,0,13.0,10,210,245,13.0,3/23,3/23,18.84,7.0,16.1,0,0,0,174.0,,10910,7172,212,6/20,,33.83,3.94,51.4,7,7,0,219.0,,5457,5241,173,5/50,5/50,30.29,5.76,31.5,6,1,0,332.0,139,2147,2922,114,4/24,4/24,25.63,8.16,18.8,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

He played as a lower middle-order batsman for Guyana between 1992-93 and 1994-95 without ever making any real impression, scoring 270 runs at 19.28 in 12 first-class matches with a best of 57. He was more prolific in the Guyanese domestic competition, with a top score of 152* for Berbice against Demerara.  \n', ""He subsequently moved to Canada and was first picked for them in 2004 as an allrounder, adding slow left-arm spin to his batting. He score a two-ball duck on his first-class debut for Canada - against USA - but recovered to record 65* in the second innings. In one-day matches his bowling has become increasingly useful, and he took 4 for 10 against Bermuda in the 2007 World Cricket League. He was named captain for Canada's Intercontinental Cup matches against Kenya and Namibia in October 2007, when Ashish Bagai was ruled out because of work commitments. He was also part of Canada's squad for the World Cup that year and although he, like the rest of the team, struggled in the competition, he did pick his caught-and-bowled dismissal of Kevin Pietersen as a particular career highlight. To cap a productive year, Dhaniram also cracked his maiden first-class century, reaching 141* as Canada beat UAE by an innings and 228 runs at King City. "", ""Dhaniram enjoyed a prolific year with the ball in 2008, picking up his third five-wicket haul for Canada in a limited-overs match against Bermuda and picking up 26 wickets across all formats - though he struggled to be incisive against major opposition. Nevertheless, he remained a consistent allround performer for Canada and in 2009 was one of six players to receive central contracts. He is currently Canada's second highest run-scorer in one-day internationals behind Ashish Bagai, and has identified the 2011 World Cup as his final engagement for the national side. If he enjoys a decent run at the event, he could well become the second Canadian player to pass 1,000 ODI runs, and with 41 ODI wickets to his name he is also likely to finish his career as Canada's leading wicket-taker in the format.  "", ""Sunil's older brother Sudesh, alongside whom he played for Guyana, joined him in emigrating but ended up in the United States. With both brothers representing their adopted national sides, they met once again on the cricket field as opponents when Canada played USA in an ICC World Cricket League Americas Region Division One game at the Central Broward ground in Florida in November 2008. Though neither brother contributed much to the result, Sudesh bagged bragging rights when his Americans prevailed by 81 runs.

A promising talent at school level, he made his first-class debut - opening the batting in the first innings - for Mashonaland A at the age of 15. In 2004, Utseya was unexpectedly thrust into the Zimbabwe national team against Sri Lanka at the age of 19 when the rebel players withdrew. He held onto a place in a weakened national side and, somewhat surprisingly, took up the captaincy from Terry Duffin in 2006. \n', ""Utseya came of age with the ball during the tour to West Indies in May 2006, where his flight and spin belied his lack of experience and years. But there weren't a great deal of happy memories for Zimbabwe in the years that followed and Utseya tendered his resignation as national captain after the side's disappointing performance at the World Twenty20 in May 2010, saying that he was stepping down in the interest of the team's future development."", 'As it turned out, the move also allowed Utseya to focus on his own development. He formed a useful spin-bowling partnership with Ray Price, the pair making an odd, yet effective, couple and even opening the bowling together when conditions warranted it. Utseya honed his game as a limited-overs cricketer, his parsimonious bowling combining with surprisingly agile fielding and a can-do batting attitude to make him an automatic pick for Zimbabwe in ODIs and a senior member of the squad. He became the second Zimbabwean to take an ODI hat-trick in the course of his 5 for 36 against South Africa in August 2014, and later in the same series sealed his place in Zimbabwean cricketing folklore when he hit Mitchell Starc for a towering six to take Zimbabwe to their first ODI victory over Australia in 31 years.', ""His career hit a major hurdle shortly afterwards, when his action was deemed illegal and he was barred from bowling the offspin that had made him Zimbabwe's most reliable one-day bowler. Utseya was forced to take drastic action, trimming an already minimal bowling action down to its absolute bare bones and remodeling himself as a bowler of slow-medium cutters.\n""]",[],4.0,8,1,107.0,45,15.28,229,46.72,0,0,12,1,2.0,0.0,164.0,132,48,1406.0,68*,16.73,2410,58.34,0,4,88,17,50.0,0.0,35.0,21,9,94.0,13*,7.83,115,81.73,0,0,6,1,6.0,0.0,82.0,137,9,2756,115*,21.53,6515,42.30,1,15,,,33.0,0.0,243.0,193,60,2092,68*,15.72,,,0,5,,,77.0,0.0,84.0,55,24,367,41*,11.83,420,87.38,0,0,21,9,24.0,0.0,4.0,6,753,410,10.0,3/60,5/192,41.0,3.26,75.3,0,0,0,164.0,160,8571,6239,133.0,5/36,5/36,46.9,4.36,64.4,2,1,0,35.0,35,749,858,26.0,3/25,3/25,33.00,6.87,28.8,0,0,0,82.0,,14284,6509,217,7/56,,29.99,2.73,65.8,8,8,2,243.0,,12220,8683,214,5/36,5/36,40.57,4.26,57.1,4,1,0,84.0,84,1818,1984,75,4/12,4/12,26.45,6.54,24.2,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

Jarvis was blooded in the home series against Kenya, and in this and subsequent one-day series in Bangladesh and South Africa, he impressed many with his pace, touching 145kph at times. He lacked control, however, and tended to be expensive, although he continued to pick up wickets. Jarvis made his first-class debut in an Intercontinental Cup game against Kenya in October 2009, and took 6 for 60 in his first Logan Cup game for the Mashonaland Eagles. Jarvis was included in Zimbabwe's squad for the tour of the West Indies in 2009-10, but withdrew from the tour with a stress fracture of the lower back. A keen sportsman, he has also played rugby for the Zimbabwe U-19s. His comeback to international cricket coincided with Zimbabwe's return to the Test fold. He debuted in his country's first Test in almost six years, which was against Bangladesh in Harare in August 2011. \n"", 'Expectations of a successful international career were shelved when he quit Zimbabwe cricket two years later to play county cricket. He said his international retirement was spurred on by a salary dispute with the board in August 2013 that forced the players to briefly go on strike and set up a union. His destination was Lancashire and, after an unproductive first season, he rediscovered much of his menace the following season, taking 62 Championship wickets as Lancashire won promotion and on course to be the division\'s leading wicket-taker until a broken hand prematurely ended his season. He stood up well to first division life, too, in 2016, leading Lancashire\'s wickets tally once more with 51 and described by his coach, Ashley Giles, as ""lethal"" as his six wickets against Surrey briefly shot Lancashire to the top of the table.', '\n', '\n']",[],12.0,22,10,126.0,25*,10.5,364,34.61,0,0,13,1,3.0,0.0,40.0,28,7,153.0,37,7.28,264,57.95,0,0,15,2,8.0,0.0,14.0,7,2,10.0,9*,2.00,28,35.71,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,81.0,113,38,1098,57,14.64,2176,50.45,0,1,142,11,22.0,0.0,74.0,46,18,260,37,9.28,451,57.64,0,0,19,4,16.0,0.0,55.0,13,5,38,10,4.75,60,63.33,0,0,3,0,17.0,0.0,12.0,21,2289,1270,46.0,5/54,7/98,27.6,3.32,49.7,2,3,0,40.0,40,1936,1812,45.0,4/37,4/37,40.26,5.61,43.0,1,0,0,14.0,14,287,391,17.0,3/15,3/15,23.00,8.17,16.8,0,0,0,81.0,145,14609,7967,310,7/35,11/119,25.70,3.27,47.1,15,17,2,74.0,71,3369,3024,92,6/35,6/35,32.86,5.38,36.6,3,1,0,55.0,55,1133,1567,54,3/15,3/15,29.01,8.29,20.9,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

A tall seam bowler, he hits the pitch hard and can get good away movement - but as with many young quick bowlers consistency is his major problem. Technically, he has a good action but a better brace of his front leg through his delivery stride would allow him to make the most of his height, rather than collapsing as he tends to do at the moment. He made his ODI debut against England in October 2004 and caused the England top-order a few anxious moments. His early Test appearances did not set the world alight, and he lost his place after taking 3 for 343 in four matches - but he has the basics and anyone with a semblance of talent should be encouraged and nurtured. Mpofu has benefited noticeably from Heath Streak's appointment as Zimbabwe's bowling coach as his action has smoothed out, his outswing is becoming more consistent (although he still has a frustrating propensity to go too wide of off stump) and his pace has increased. One definite shortcoming, however, is his crease occupation. Not content with being stumped twice in an afternoon (for a pair) in the first Test against New Zealand in August 2005, he followed up by being run out for 3 in the second match, as he strolled down the pitch to congratulate his team-mate on reaching his half-century.  He still tends to blow hot and cold and has few rivals in the race to be considered international cricket's worst batsman, but when Zimbabwe return to Test cricket Mpofu will have an important role to play. \n"", ' \n']",[],15.0,28,10,105.0,33,5.83,249,42.16,0,0,7,5,4.0,0.0,80.0,39,19,46.0,6,2.3,198,23.23,0,0,1,0,11.0,0.0,24.0,7,4,16.0,6*,5.33,30,53.33,0,0,0,1,5.0,0.0,104.0,161,44,1154,57,9.86,3495,33.01,0,1,,,26.0,0.0,178.0,93,42,404,41,7.92,863,46.81,0,0,,,31.0,0.0,71.0,29,15,121,27*,8.64,154,78.57,0,0,6,1,15.0,0.0,15.0,23,2489,1392,29.0,4/92,5/123,48.0,3.35,85.8,2,0,0,80.0,79,3767,3407,88.0,6/52,6/52,38.71,5.42,42.8,2,1,0,24.0,24,515,755,20.0,3/16,3/16,37.75,8.79,25.7,0,0,0,104.0,,16635,8598,280,7/37,,30.70,3.10,59.4,8,10,0,178.0,,8317,6709,229,6/8,6/8,29.29,4.83,36.3,7,3,0,71.0,70,1499,1906,69,4/17,4/17,27.62,7.62,21.7,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

This was against West Indies in 2000-01 when, batting at No. 3 instead of his normal opening position, he scored a composed 119 that was largely responsible for Zimbabwe saving the match after conceding a first-innings lead of 216. Earlier in the year he had not only become the youngest Zimbabwean ever to score a first-class century, but also the first black player in Zimbabwe to do so - a watershed moment in the country's history.\n \nA year later, though, he put his professional cricket career on hold as he began a three-year course at the University of the Free State. Although an agreement was reached that he would still be available for Zimbabwe if required, he could not maintain his form playing against club opposition in South Africa, and the national selectors initially decided to await his return to the country. But the Rebel crisis led to his early recall in the one-dayers against England where, unsurprisingly, he struggled before registering his maiden ODI fifty in the final game. His return to the Test match team brought mixed results, but he was Zimbabwe's best batsman, technically, on their tour of South Africa, where he showed an application lacking in his team mates.\n \nAfter being criticised for not being able to score quickly enough early on in his career, Masakadza's ability in one-day cricket has steadily increased and 2009 was a bumper year for him. He scored over 1000 runs in ODIs in the calendar year at an average of 43.48 and a strike rate of 88.08, including scores of 156 and 178 not out in the home series against Kenya, the first time a batsman has made 150 or more twice in the same one-day series.\n \nMasakadza was part of Zimbabwe's XI when they played their first Test in six years, against Bangladesh in August 2011, scoring his second Test century a decade after his first. He has continued to show greater dexterity as a batsman, adding a hook and pull to a repertoire that already included muscular play off the front foot. He has also added value to Zimbabwe's set-up as a calm, amiable presence amid sometimes tempestuous times. Masakadza entered the peak of his career after turning 30, and was finally rewarded with a trip to a World Cup in 2015 - remarkably, his first."", '  \n']",[],38.0,76,2,2223.0,158,30.04,5009,44.38,5,8,264,23,29.0,0.0,204.0,203,4,5604.0,178*,28.16,7618,73.56,5,34,577,86,71.0,0.0,58.0,58,2,1516.0,93*,27.07,1295,117.06,0,10,139,58,20.0,0.0,140.0,251,11,9564,208*,39.85,,,23,44,,,124.0,0.0,339.0,337,22,10457,178*,33.19,,,9,70,,,139.0,0.0,122.0,121,15,3812,162*,35.96,3005,126.85,4,28,314,159,52.0,0.0,38.0,24,1164,489,16.0,3/24,3/24,30.56,2.52,72.7,0,0,0,204.0,84,1826,1622,39.0,3/39,3/39,41.58,5.32,46.8,0,0,0,58.0,9,72,113,2.0,1/4,1/4,56.50,9.41,36.0,0,0,0,140.0,,4130,1831,62,4/11,,29.53,2.66,66.6,,0,0,339.0,,3308,2812,86,4/36,4/36,32.69,5.10,38.4,3,0,0,122.0,29,336,380,19,2/6,2/6,20.00,6.78,17.6,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

His international career has had two clear phases: the first, when he debuted amid the state of emergency in Zimbabwean cricket that came after the sacking of the 15 'rebel' players and the second, when he returned to Zimbabwe an older, wiser bowler ahead of the 2010-11 season.  \n"", ""Panyangara made his international debut at just 18 years old, when he should have been studying for his A levels but was instead opening the bowling against Sanath Jayasuriya. Though it arrived too early, even before his debut it was clear that Panyangara would eventually play for the national side - he'd come to attention on the world stage with a remarkable bowling performance of 6 for 31 that dismantled Australia at the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in February 2004.\n \nBut he lasted less than a year in the national set-up before, in early 2005, he developed a stress fracture in his back that kept him away from competitive cricket for a year.  He left Zimbabwe for England, eventually resurfacing as an opening bowler for West Indian Cavaliers, a club side in the Nottinghamshire Premier League. He was a yard slower but, in swing-friendly English conditions, increasingly adept at moving the ball through the air and off the pitch.\n \nPanyangara returned to Zimbabwe in 2010 and slotted almost immediately into the A side. He missed out on a spot in Zimbabwe's team for the Test return against Bangladesh in August 2011 but played an integral role in Zimbabwe's historic win over Pakistan in September 2013. With form, fitness and greener pastures overseas clearing away much of his fast-bowling competition, Panyangara played for Zimbabwe much more regularly in the seasons that followed. He settled into his role as one of the team's senior seamers with aplomb and was known as a lighthearted presence in the dressing room. \n \nPanyangara grew up in Marondera, a country town about 45 miles south-east of Harare, and learned his cricket at the local primary school - Godfrey Huggins. He was a boarder at Churchill High School in Harare, and his allround skill helped him break into the Takashinga Sports Club first team before he'd written his O Levels.

Four months later, he made his Test debut too, against Pakistan in Harare.

Sibanda is an opening batsman and an occasional medium-pace bowler, and was a student at the CFX Academy in 2002. He scored 58 on debut against the West Indies, but his selection for the national team came too early, and despite failing to live up to his potential, the crisis in the national side meant that he kept his place long after others would have been discarded. Despite being a superb timer of the ball off both the front and back feet, he was slow to learn the ability to build a big innings and his selections were due almost entirely to his outstanding potential rather than actual performance. He has a very sound technique, but poor shot selection has often brought about his downfall. Coach Kevin Curran noted that he matured well on the West Indian tour in May 2006. He suffered a hand injury early on, but took his opportunities when given them, starting the tour with 52 at Georgetown, and finishing with a 78 and then a superb century in the Tri-Series final against Bermuda.  \n', ""He had a successful club season in Sydney, Australia, which seemed to have paid dividends when he registered scores of 47, 93 not out, and 64 in the home series against Bangladesh in February 2007. He could not carry this form into the World Cup, however, and his only innings of note in the tournament was 67 in Zimbabwe's tied game against Ireland at Kingston. He returned to Australian club cricket after the World Cup amid questions over his commitment to international cricket, but subsequently returned to Zimbabwe and was selected for the Afro-Asia Cup, making some impressive starts without being able to push on for a big score. He narrowly missed out on a first ODI hundred against a Test-playing nation when he was run out for 96 against the West Indies in Bulawayo in December 2007, and remained in contention for the national side thereafter with the odd good innings. "", 'Sibanda seemed to have fully matured as a batsman during the 2009-10 Zimbabwean domestic season. He was named as captain of the Midwest Rhinos and called up for the Zimbabwe XI to take on Kenya in the Intercontinental cup game at Kwekwe. Responding superbly, he rescued the Zimbabweans with 209 in the first innings and sealed the victory with an unbeaten 116 in the second. This marked the beginning of a rich vein of form for Sibanda, and he rocketed to the top of the domestic first-class batting tables. Before the end of the Logan Cup, he had taken his season tally to almost 1500 runs at an average of 95 with nine hundreds, including a career-best 215. Tellingly, only once did he pass fifty and fail to reach a hundred. With statistics like those, it is hard to see how he can be left out of the national side, and will likely play a major role should Zimbabwe return to Test cricket in the near future. \n', ' January 2010']",[],14.0,28,0,591.0,93,21.1,1177,50.21,0,2,86,6,16.0,0.0,127.0,126,4,2994.0,116,24.54,4716,63.48,2,21,328,35,42.0,0.0,26.0,26,1,511.0,59,20.44,503,101.59,0,1,52,11,12.0,0.0,134.0,245,12,7695,217,33.02,,,18,33,,,157.0,0.0,250.0,244,13,6006,190,26.00,,,4,39,,,92.0,0.0,72.0,72,7,1584,70*,24.36,1521,104.14,0,8,136,44,29.0,0.0,14.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,11,267,265,3.0,1/12,1/12,88.33,5.95,89.0,0,0,0,26.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,134.0,,2843,1726,39,5/55,,44.25,3.64,72.8,1,1,0,250.0,,809,775,10,2/50,2/50,77.50,5.74,80.9,0,0,0,72.0,3,15,33,0,-,-,-,13.20,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Taylor, disillusioned with international cricket, signed a three-year Kolpak deal with Nottinghamshire which made him ineligible to play for Zimbabwe while that contract is in effect. He made his decision slightly open-ended, not entirely ruling out the possibility that he might one day return to the fold. And he did just that. \n"", '""I was concerned about the future of Zimbabwe cricket and with the administration side of it. I felt people were not qualified enough to run Zimbabwe cricket officially and just the way we were treated as players. It was really difficult to try and play the best cricket you could and deal with the issues.""', 'Those who doubted that he would ever return were proved wrong midway through his final season at Notts when he gained permission for an early release, citing homesickness: his wife Kelly had remained in Zimbabwe with their four young sons. He had a more optimistic attitude towards Zimbabwe cricket, too, anticipating that affairs would be better run on and off the field. At 31, he returned to Test cricket, against West Indies in Bulawayo, nearly three years after his previous innings.', 'Since making his debut in April 2004, Taylor was involved in almost every ODI - the format Zimbabwe play most often - his country has taken part in. In 2008, he missed out on 17 ODIs after making himself unavailable because of a dispute with the board and a year before that he was dropped for the last match of a series in Bangladesh and the return home series because of poor form. But, by and large, 216 matches across all formats (167 of them ODIs with a batting average of 34.82) told its own story.', '\nBut Taylor fell out with Stephen Mangongo, an uncompromising Zimbabwe coach. Firstly, he was stripped off the captaincy in July 2013 when Zimbabwe Cricket suffered one of its regular restructurings and the leadership was split with Elton Chigumbura assuming control in the limited-overs formats. He later relinquished the wicketkeeping role because Mangongo asserted that he preferred ""the best man for the job, not a part-timer"". Finally, in August 2014, he was dropped against South Africa when few anticipated such a move. ""It\'s a professional sport, there is always pressure. It is not Boozer\'s XI,"" Mangongo said pointedly. Eight weeks before the World Cup, Mangongo was sacked and redeployed with the Under-19s but Taylor\'s mind was made up.', 'He was the second Zimbabwe player to go Kolpak after their Test comeback with Kyle Jarvis also signing for Lancashire. ', ""Taylor was appointed captain after the 2011 World Cup, as Zimbabwe worked towards a return from a self-imposed exile from Test cricket. He led them to a successful Test comeback later that year, in which he also scored his maiden century, and to a win over Pakistan a month later. Under Taylor, Zimbabwe seemed a renewed force, despite a sparse fixture list and struggles away from home. As one of the senior-most players in the squad, Taylor played an important part in unifying the players in their off-field battles over unpaid salaries and the formation of a players' association."", 'Taylor shot to prominence at Cape Town on September 12, 2007, his ice-cool 60 not out carrying Zimbabwe to an incredible five-wicket win over Australia in the ICC World Twenty20. Taylor marshalled a tense run-chase with the sort of sang froid that few had ever credited him with.', 'As a young cricketer, he was nurtured by Iain Campbell, father of Alistair, at the well-known Lilfordia primary school near Harare, was a regular choice for national age-group teams and played in two Under-19 World Cups. He made his first-class debut for Mashonaland A at the age of 15; the following year he scored 200 not out in the B Division of the Logan Cup, and he was fast-tracked into the Zimbabwe national team against Sri Lanka in 2003-04 at the age of 18 after the withdrawal of the so-called rebel players. As a batsman he was soon well respected by the opposition, but tended to get out when well set. Poor footwork early in an innings was also a handicap at the start of his career, but he worked to improve that and in November 2009 struck his maiden one-day hundred.', ""That knock proved something of a turning point for him, and in the year that followed he struck centuries against Sri Lanka and South Africa and proved to be Zimbabwe's stand-out batsman at the 2011 World Cup, his trademark uppercut to third man one of the lasting images of the tournament. His star continued to rise as Zimbabwe readied themselves for a return to Test cricket, and in June 2011 he was named captain of the national side."", 'The additional responsibility of captaincy, which he had always fancied, worked wonders for his batting, as he scored four centuries in his first seven Tests in charge, after scoring none in his ten previous Tests. He also scored hundreds in each innings against Bangladesh in Harare in 2013, thus becoming the first from Zimbabwe, and the 12th in all, to achieve this feat. ', ""In July 2014, as part of ZC's split captaincy plan, he retained the Test leadership while Elton Chigumbura took over the limited-overs games. Though he's not very swift in the field, he has a safe pair of hands and kept wicket for Zimbabwe fairly often before Richmond Mutumbami and Regis Chakabva's progress as wicketkeepers allowed him to concentrate more fully on his batting."", ""Taylor's move to Nottinghamshire did not go altogether smoothly. His Championship displays were highly inconsistent. He also caused consternation by falling asleep in an unlocked car after his celebrations of Nottinghamshire's progress to the semi-finals of the Royal London Cup in 2015 went haywire. Taylor had to be woken by police after a Nottingham businessman opened his unlocked Chevrolet Matiz to find Taylor sleeping off a long night close to the Trent Bridge ground. He escaped charges. At least before he departed he managed to pick up a winners' medal in the 2017 Royal London Cup final."", '\n', '\n']",[],28.0,56,4,1840.0,171,35.38,3564,51.62,6,8,186,15,27.0,0.0,188.0,187,15,6156.0,145*,35.79,8085,76.14,10,36,537,96,118.0,29.0,30.0,30,5,660.0,75*,26.40,565,116.81,0,5,58,18,14.0,2.0,128.0,232,13,8807,217,40.21,,,31,31,,,142.0,4.0,298.0,290,26,9327,154,35.32,,,18,51,,,185.0,41.0,144.0,138,19,3202,101*,26.90,2638,121.37,1,23,292,85,57.0,13.0,28.0,4,42,38,0.0,-,-,35.33,5.42,-,0,0,0,188.0,21,396,406,9.0,3/54,3/54,45.11,6.15,44.0,0,0,0,30.0,2,30,17,1.0,1/16,1/16,17.00,3.4,30.0,0,0,0,128.0,,384,225,4,2/36,,56.25,3.51,96.0,0,0,0,298.0,,606,604,20,5/28,5/28,30.20,5.98,30.3,0,1,0,144.0,8,150,152,8,3/38,3/38,19.00,6.08,18.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Earmarked as the long-term successor to club colleague Andy Flower, Taibu was plucked from Churchill Boys High School to tour the West Indies in 1999-00, after impressing onlookers with his natural ability. Three months later he was in England, on stand-by at Trent Bridge after injury put Flower's dual role in doubt. He had yet to play domestic first-class cricket at this stage - his debut for Mashonaland had to be put on hold after he turned up at the wrong ground - but he has toured South Africa with the Zimbabwe U-19s, and was one of Zimbabwe's few bright spots in the 2003 World Cup and their tour to England later that year. A promising batsman, albeit with a penchant for cross-batted strokes, he is steadily improving at Test and ODI level. \n"", ""In April 2004, he was appointed captain of Zimbabwe following the resignation of Heath Streak, and he led a woefully inexperienced by example in the face of repeated heavy defeats.  But the pressure began to tell, and by the autumn of 2005 he found himself at the front of another players revolt, this time widely backed and against the general  mismanagement of the board.  It led to him being villified in the domestic press and threatened by some unsavoury elements connected to the board itself, and in November 2005 he announced his resignation as captain and his retirement from international cricket. Of all the high-profile departures from the game in  Zimbabwe, none were felt so deeply as Taibu - a home-grown product,  a world-class wicketkeeper-batsman, and the country's first black captain.   "", ""After spells in Bangladesh and England, he moved to South Africa later in 2006 and made clear his intention to sit out the four-year qualification to try to play international cricket for them.  But it didn't work out, and to more than a few raised eyebrows he reappeared in Zimbabwe colours in mid 2007."", 'Taibu announced his retirement from international cricket in July 2012, aged 29 years, after a topsy-turvy career spanning more than a decade.

That shot has occupied a proud position in the repertoire of some of Zimbabwe's finest batsmen: legend has it that Dave Houghton brought up both his hundred and his double with reverse-sweeps in the course of his 266 against Sri Lanka, and Andy Flower used the stroke in an almost profligate manner in many of his memorable innings. Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering. \n"", ""Reverse-sweeps aside, Williams has other shots too, and plays them often. His precocious talent was apparent while he was still a teenager. He was expected to be called up at the time of the players' strike in April 2004, but his father Collin, a former first-class player and national hockey coach, refused to release him and insisted his son should concentrate more on his studies. Almost a year later, and with just one first-class match under his belt, he was drafted into the Zimbabwe squad to tour South Africa. Although he led the U-19 side in the World Cup in Sri Lanka in February 2006 - the highlight being a win over England - there were rumours both before and after the tournament that he was not happy with the board. This turned out to be true when he turned down a central contract the following month, opting to look for a more settled career overseas. He changed his mind three months later, however, returning to play for Zimbabwe. The on-off farrago resurfaced in 2008 when he again quit for a contract in South Africa, only to return weeks later. "", ""One feels that disciplinary issues, whether perceived or actual, are never far away with Williams, who often speaks in as forthright a manner as he bats. He is one of Zimbabwe's best players of spin but was was not considered for selection for Zimbabwe's tour of Bangladesh in late 2014 after interruptions in his involvement in a training camp and an aborted disciplinary hearing. Williams responded to his omission with two centuries, a 96 and 10 wickets for Tuskers while Zimbabwe were away, underlining just what they were missing. If he is managed well Williams has the potential to be an all-round match-winner for Zimbabwe. He has a more-than-useful second string as a left-arm spinner and a keen cricketing brain, having captained Zimbabwe Under-19 and Matabeleland Tuskers on occasion."", '\n']",[],10.0,20,0,553.0,119,27.65,1012,54.64,1,2,71,1,9.0,0.0,122.0,118,16,3395.0,129*,33.28,4179,81.23,2,29,277,34,43.0,0.0,26.0,26,2,563.0,58*,23.45,459,122.65,0,3,52,11,11.0,0.0,60.0,109,6,4357,178,42.30,,,11,22,,,57.0,0.0,198.0,185,23,5048,129*,31.16,,,5,34,,,74.0,0.0,54.0,53,11,904,58*,21.52,795,113.71,0,3,86,12,25.0,0.0,10.0,16,1483,772,17.0,3/20,6/111,45.41,3.12,87.2,0,0,0,122.0,98,3672,3008,60.0,3/15,3/15,50.13,4.91,61.2,0,0,0,26.0,25,486,585,19.0,3/15,3/15,30.78,7.22,25.5,0,0,0,60.0,,4731,2331,67,5/36,,34.79,2.95,70.6,2,1,0,198.0,,6264,4916,125,7/25,7/25,39.32,4.70,50.1,2,1,0,54.0,50,858,1010,37,3/15,3/15,27.29,7.06,23.1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

There was never any doubt about the fast bowler's talent. Taylor is a natural in getting the ball to move away and, when at his best, he drew comparisons with West Indies legend Michael Holding. Injuries, however, had a knack of dragging him down. \n"", ""In a five-year stretch between November 2009 and June 2014, Taylor was able to play only five T20Is and four ODIs, and had his commitment questioned by the WICB. Just before that tough period, he had spearheaded one of West Indies' greatest Test wins, at his home ground in Kingston, by ripping through England with a match haul of 8 for 85. He eventually regained his place in the team for a tour of India in 2014 - which the players abandoned due to a payment dispute with their cricket board - and has been a regular fixture in Tests and ODIs since then."", ""Taylor's rise to international cricket was rapid. He was named the most promising fast bowler in the 2003 Carib Beer Series, after picking up 21 wickets at 20.14 in six first-class matches. That haul included a second-innings 8 for 59 in Jamaica's five-wicket victory over Trinidad & Tobago, a match in which he took ten wickets for the first time. But a back injury sidelined him from competitive cricket."", ""He picked up 26 wickets at 16.61 in the Carib Beer Cup in the 2004-05 season, and in the next, he grabbed 12 wickets at 29 to force his way back into the West Indies team. When India toured the West Indies in mid-2006, they ran into an energised Taylor at his best. Quick and accurate, Taylor turned into West Indies' spearhead as the series progressed. His pacy burst on the lifeless surface in St Kitts won many admirers, but it was his lethal performance in Kingston that underlined his worth. Getting the ball to lift off a good length, he thrilled his home crowd with his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests."", ""He picked up 26 wickets at 27.69 in the 2006-07 season and bagged his then career-best figures in ODIs - 4 for 49, including a hat-trick, when he bowled West Indies to a thrilling win against Australia in the Champions Trophy. He bettered that a year later when he snared 5 for 48 against Zimbabwe, and in 2008 was West Indies' leading bowler in the Test series against Sri Lanka, with 11 wickets in two matches at 24.81. That helped him bag the Jamaica Cricketer-of-the-Year award for 2008. That year he also blitzed a Test century at just under a run a ball, from No. 8, against New Zealand. "", ""Form on his comeback after back injury in 2014 fuelled his 2015 World Cup dream, where he was West Indies' highest wicket-taker with 17 scalps in seven matches. He was also part of West Indies' World T20 winning squad in 2016. But an unsuccessful run in the longest format in Australia in December 2015-January 2016, when he picked up two wickets in three Tests, resulted in him calling time on his Test career in July 2016.""]",[],46.0,73,7,856.0,106,12.96,1368,62.57,1,1,116,19,8.0,0.0,90.0,42,9,278.0,43*,8.42,323,86.06,0,0,31,5,20.0,0.0,30.0,15,6,118.0,21,13.11,92,128.26,0,0,10,6,9.0,0.0,103.0,161,25,1595,106,11.72,,,1,1,,,25.0,0.0,135.0,68,17,518,43*,10.15,,,0,0,,,27.0,0.0,101.0,41,19,228,21,10.36,194,117.52,0,0,16,12,20.0,0.0,46.0,78,7757,4480,130.0,6/47,9/95,34.46,3.46,59.6,5,4,0,90.0,88,4341,3780,128.0,5/48,5/48,29.53,5.22,33.9,3,1,0,30.0,30,600,863,33.0,3/6,3/6,26.15,8.63,18.1,0,0,0,103.0,,15824,8401,326,8/59,,25.76,3.18,48.5,12,16,2,135.0,,6431,5414,203,5/40,5/40,26.66,5.05,31.6,5,2,0,101.0,100,2152,2952,126,5/10,5/10,23.42,8.23,17.0,2,2,0,False,False,False,False

Cricket, though, was his calling. He lived in a neighborhood which included eventual New Zealand team-mates Kane Williamson and Doug Bracewell, and had the backing of a supportive household that also kept him grounded.', '\nSigns of his skill were evident even as a teenager. As a 17-year old, he was named the fastest secondary school bowler in the country. A year later, he was representing New Zealand at the Under-19 World Cup.', ""\nThe transition to senior cricket, though, was not quite seamless. Boult suffered a stress fracture of the back in 2009 which put him out of cricket for two years and taught him to concentrate on strength and conditioning. There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark. He became one of New Zealand's irreplaceable players across formats and one of many protagonists in the side's march to their first World Cup final in 2015. "", ""\nBoult had a tough time breaking into the limited-overs sides at first, due to a perception that he doesn't move the white ball as much as the red one. But his effectiveness in Test cricket was too compelling to ignore: he raced past 100 wickets in his 29th match and in 2013, only two years since his debut, he was New Zealand's top-wicket taker. With Brendon McCullum placing a high premium on attacking cricket in the shorter versions as well and Boult proving himself as a bowler who preferred getting batsmen out rather than keeping them quiet, it was a perfect fit. Confirmation came in World Cup 2015 when he ended up the joint-leading wicket taker with 22 scalps in nine matches including 5 for 27 in an epic victory over Australia. His worth in T20 cricket was emphasised by a (approximately) $600,000 payday in the IPL."", '\nBoult\'s strength, according to Northern Districts coach John Pamment, is that, ""he\'s got a lovely wrist position and the fact that the wrist goes right behind the ball gives him that control."" Another asset for Boult is friend and sounding board Tim Southee. When on song, their partnership makes for compelling viewing, not to mention telling numbers. In 2014, the pair picked up nearly half the wickets New Zealand took - 67 of 143 - en route to the side\'s most successful Test year, with five wins in nine matches. Boult is also among the few fast bowlers who are exceptional fielders, and has a particular knack for one-handed blinders.', '\n']",['New Zealand Cricket Almanack Player of the Year - 2015'],61.0,76,37,562.0,52*,14.41,1063,52.86,0,1,56,25,36.0,0.0,79.0,35,20,144.0,21*,9.6,190,75.78,0,0,13,6,23.0,0.0,25.0,7,3,14.0,5,3.50,24,58.33,0,0,0,0,12.0,0.0,94.0,116,47,970,61,14.05,1912,50.73,0,2,105,39,51.0,0.0,108.0,49,25,199,21*,8.29,269,73.97,0,0,17,6,33.0,0.0,88.0,19,11,36,5*,4.50,59,61.01,0,0,0,0,39.0,0.0,61.0,115,13591,6776,246.0,6/30,10/80,27.54,2.99,55.2,13,8,1,79.0,79,4290,3632,147.0,7/34,7/34,24.7,5.07,29.1,5,5,0,25.0,25,551,784,37.0,4/34,4/34,21.18,8.53,14.8,1,0,0,94.0,169,19213,9437,354,6/30,10/80,26.65,2.94,54.2,15,16,1,108.0,106,5729,4861,189,7/34,7/34,25.71,5.09,30.3,7,5,0,88.0,88,1895,2651,98,4/34,4/34,27.05,8.39,19.3,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

The most serious was a back problem in 2003 that led to nearly two years out and an operation in which his spine was fused with titanium wire. There were also various issues with knees, feet and other body parts, but Bond's desire to play could never be questioned. Some of the trouble came from his unwillingness to reduce his intensity; had he been happy to drop his pace and take things easier, he might have played more cricket. "", ""That he didn't take that path said much about his competitive nature; the game always lifted a notch when he had the ball. His athletic action was geared towards inswing and his 150-plus kph efforts meant the ball would swing late. Toe-crushing yorkers were a specialty and he feasted on the world's best batsmen; Ricky Ponting fell to Bond in all of the first six ODIs they played against each other. Bond always lifted against Australia, and it was a sign of his great skill that he took 44 ODI wickets at 15.79 against them. That included a hat-trick in Hobart in 2006-07 and one of Bond's personal favourites, his 6 for 23 against the eventual champions in the 2003 World Cup.

Unsurprisingly, his first international foray was in the T20 format. Having earned a reputation as a heavy hitter in New Zealand's domestic T20 competition, de Grandhomme earned a debut against his native Zimbabwe in 2012.

In the ODI series at home against Sri Lanka in 2005-06, scores of 70 not out, 32, 50 and 112 led to a Test baptism: he added 75 in his second match, as New Zealand took an unbeatable lead over West Indies.

Franklin was included for the third Test at Trent Bridge, and although New Zealand lost he did his cause no harm with six wickets, five of them Test century-makers. He stayed on for the one-dayers that followed, and picked up the match award at Chester-le-Street for his 5 for 42 as England were skittled for 101.

More wickets followed against West Indies, then in April 2006 Franklin did his allrounder claims no harm with an unbeaten 122 - and a stand of 256 with Stephen Fleming - against South Africa at Cape Town."", ""A knee injury hampered his 2006-07 season and he underwent surgery for a patella tendon injury in his right knee. Franklin eased back into competitive cricket by playing Twenty20 and one-day games for Australian Capital Territory and representing New Zealand in the Emerging Players tour of Queensland in October 2008. He made his first-class comeback for Wellington in November with 69 and 4 for 56 in his team's innings victory over Canterbury."", 'He returned to the international team later the same year but struggled to nail down a permanent place, despite performing strongly in county cricket for Gloucestershire in 2009 and 2010. He was part of the New Zealand side that made it to the semi-finals of the 2011 World Cup and expressed his disappointment at missing out on a central contract, though he regained a deal the following year. By this point, Franklin had developed into an allrounder capable of scoring useful runs down the order and bowling economical spells and he remains a fixture in the T20 and ODI teams, although a Test return was less successful.', ""Middlesex signed Franklin in 2015 as an on-overseas player thanks to his Irish ancestry, effectively bringing about his retirement from international cricket. Adam Voges' call-up by Australia meant that he soon assumed the captaincy, a role he held when Middlesex won their first title for 23 years in 2016 - the title settled on the final afternoon in a contrived declaration against Yorkshire with the prize of the Championship to the winners.

He has a high degree of agility in the field, where his skills were developed as a schoolboy representative soccer goalkeeper, and he complements that with solid medium-fast bowling skills and a naturally aggressive approach with the bat. Foot problems during the summer of 2001-02 meant he missed a season at a vital stage of his development, but he came back strongly in 2002-03 and sealed a place for himself in both the Test and one-day international sides. In 2003-04, he narrowly missed out on a century, as he struck 97 against Pakistan. But in the first Test against South Africa, he carved 119 not out and then 90 in the second Test, which earned him a touring spot for the England series in 2004. Oram continued to acquit himself well, and maintained his place for the Bangladesh tour in 2004-05. After suffering a stress reaction to a back injury, he missed Australia's tour of New Zealand in 2005 but returned to hit a delightful hundred, his third in Tests, against South Africa at Centurion in April 2006. His one-day game peaked at the CB Series in 2006-07, where his impressive striking rattled both England and Australia. His first ODI century, an amazing 101 from 72 balls against Australia, almost got New Zealand over the line in a huge run-chase at Perth. He broke the ring finger on his left hand taking a catch on the boundary in the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series soon after but made it to the World Cup. His comment that he would 'chop off his finger' to play sparked frenzied reaction in the media but was meant in jest and he went on to average 33 with the bat and 25 with the ball as New Zealand reached the semi-finals.

They won again in 2003-04 and were runners up in 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2005-06.', 'While Patel probably never fulfilled his ability on the international stage, he developed into a highly effective bowling all-rounder at domestic level and has enjoyed a particularly successful spell as a long-term overseas player for Warwickshire, for whom he has produced much of his best cricket. At the end of the 2014 English domestic season - a season in which he had rejected an approach from New Zealand to resurrect his international career - he was named the Most Valuable Player in county cricket.', 'It was a return of 6 for 32 against Otago in the last State Championship match of 2004-05 that propelled him into international cricket. Bracewell took him to Zimbabwe for a one-day tournament in August 2005. He played nine ODIs during the season, but in eight was either the super-sub or the subbed-out player; his batting - at that stage - offered little. At home his 2 for 23 from ten overs throttled Sri Lanka at Wellington, and won him the man-of-the-match award, then three wickets at Christchurch helped subdue West Indies. All this put Patel in line for a first Test cap, which came against South Africa at Cape Town in April 2006. ', ""He performed more than respectably - a five-wicket haul against West Indies at Napier in late 2008 was a highlight - but, with Daniel Vettori's presence limiting opportunities, Patel was generally reduced to the role of substitute or second spinner. He played only six home Tests - in each of them he was second spinner to Vettori - and when he finally had a chance to stake a claim as first choice, he struggled against India, Sri Lanka and South Africa. When New Zealand were thrashed by South Africa - they were bowled out for just 45 in Cape Town - with Patel bowled backing away, it seemed his time was up."", ""But whatever his struggles in international cricket, he proved an inspired choice as overseas player for Warwickshire. After scoring a maiden century on first-class debut for the club in 2009, he returned for every season afterwards except 2010, claiming 185 first-class wickets for the side up to the end of 2014 at an average of just 27.12 and contributing nearly 1,500 runs, too, at an average of nearly 29. He played a huge role in Warwickshire's Championship success of 2012, their T20 success of 2014 and took them within sight of a double of that season with an outstanding spell of bowling against Durham in the final of the Royal London One-Day Cup at Lord's. He finished with 107 wickets in all competitions that year and turned down a recall to the New Zealand squad for the Caribbean tour to ensure he maintained his excellent relationship with Warwickshire. They responded by extending his contract until the end of 2016."", 'Patel duly paid them back with 69 wickets to top the bowling charts for the season. He subsequently made a comeback to the national side when he was picked for the tour of India in September of that year and filled in for the injured Mark Craig for the second Test at Eden Gardens in his first appearance for his country in over three years.', ""In March the following year, Patel played his first Test at the Basin Reserve, his home ground, against South Africa. Two months later, he played his final match for New Zealand, an ODI against Bangladesh in Dublin. Though he made it to New Zealand's squad for the Champions Trophy, he did not play a game.

Abandoned by his separated parents, Ryder spent his teenage years bouncing around friends' houses and sleeping in their couches. Along the way he began playing indoor cricket, and turned out to be pretty damn good at it. Those formative years without boundaries or direction also formed the basis of the alcohol trouble that has been a companion almost throughout his adult life. \n"", ""If that hint of vulnerability, that rebellious streak, that human touch in an increasingly robotic world of sport, endeared Ryder to the public, the failure to keep that promise of talent and the tendency to not learn from indiscretions frustrated in equal measure.

He worked hard, got fitter, got therapy, boxed a little, came back to domestic cricket, and just when it seemed he was approaching a happy space in life he was assaulted brutally outside a suburban Christchurch bar in March 2013.

His first international incarnation came for Australia in the West Indies in 2008 when he stood in for the injured Brad Haddin in four ODIs and a Twenty20 and he showed he was not out of his depth: his glovework was brilliant and at the tiny Warner Park in St Kitts he clubbed a 22-ball half-century, then the equal third-quickest ODI fifty scored by an Australia player. But his form fell away during the following domestic summer and he added only one more T20 international to his tally for Australia. By the end of 2008-09 his runs had dried up so severely that he had even been dropped by Western Australia and his future appeared bleak. \n', '\nOver the next few seasons, Ronchi was there and thereabouts in state cricket but he was overtaken by Graham Manou, Tim Paine and Matthew Wade in the queue behind Haddin. At the end of 2011-12, he decided to try his luck in his country of birth and secured a contract with Wellington. His performances were strong enough to earn him a call-up to the New Zealand ODI side once he had qualified in 2013 and against England in May he debuted, becoming the first man since Kepler Wessels nearly 20 years earlier to represent two full ICC member nations.', '\nAs New Zealand rode an ODI wave that eventually culminated with defeat at the final of the 2015 World Cup, Ronchi made a decent case for himself as a lower-order batsman. He smashed 170 off 99 balls against Sri Lanka in Dunedin in 2014, then the highest score ever by a No. 7 batsman and, in May 2015, seven years after making his international debut, Ronchi earned his maiden Test cap. A half-century in the first innings at Headingley helped his side level a two-match series against England 1-1. Ronchi played three more Tests, two World T20s and two Champions Trophies before calling time on his international career in June 2017. ', ""\nHe had moved with his family to Perth at the age of seven and debuted for Western Australia in 2001-02. He established himself as a solid gloveman and clean striker of the ball and in 2006-07 he made his mark with the then fastest century in Australian domestic one-day history. His 56-ball ton against New South Wales featured a series of powerful pulls off Stuart Clark, and it eclipsed the 62-ball record set by Ronchi's team-mate Adam Voges two seasons earlier. "", '\nAnother standout moment was when he struck 89 from 49 balls against an England XI in the Lilac Hill match the same summer. Perhaps his most remarkable display was in a 2007-08 Pura Cup match against Queensland when he scored a 51-ball century, with the second fifty coming in a scarcely believable 11 deliveries. At that stage Australia were keen to call Ronchi their own, but several years later New Zealand were equally pleased to claim his services.']",[],4.0,8,0,319.0,88,39.87,432,73.84,0,2,41,6,5.0,0.0,85.0,68,9,1397.0,170*,23.67,1220,114.50,1,4,149,43,105.0,12.0,33.0,26,6,359.0,51*,17.95,256,140.23,0,1,30,14,24.0,6.0,100.0,158,15,5614,148,39.25,6685,83.97,16,23,,,343.0,17.0,190.0,171,20,4194,170*,27.77,3919,107.01,7,21,,,249.0,32.0,196.0,180,20,3951,102,24.69,2577,153.31,1,23,391,184,114,34,4.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,85.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,33.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,100.0,,30,12,0,-,-,-,2.40,-,0,0,0,190.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,196.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

He had nearly 10 years of domestic cricket before he was called up to the Test squad, having made his one-day international debut much earlier. Originally a seamer, a knee injury forced him to take his batting more seriously, and he switched from being a bowler who can bat into being a batsman who occasionally bowls. He was awarded his Test cap on the eve of the Karachi Test in May 2002, only for it to be taken back when the match was cancelled as a result of a bomb blast. When he finally got the chance he scored a century and a half-century on debut against West Indies. On the same tour of the Caribbean he broke the New Zealand record for one-day bowling with 6 for 25 in Trinidad.  He has been encouraged by John Bracewell to work on his offspin as an option which would put less strain on his body, but this has yet to be unveiled. Having spent the best part of 11 years with Northern Districts, Styris signed for Auckland - and in 2005 was tempted by Middlesex for a stint in the county game. He continued a strong link with English cricket, taking up a mid-season contract with Durham in 2007. A thrilling 101 in New Zealand's chase of a then-record 322 against Australia at Christchurch was followed by useful contributions in the one-day series against West Indies at home. A timely unbeaten 103 on and some key wickets on the first day at Auckland saw New Zealand take a series lead in the Tests. A back injury ruled him out of the home series against Sri Lanka in December 2006 but he returned in time for the last few games of the tri-series in Australia and was considered fit enough to be named in the 15-man World Cup squad where he was one of the leading performers with 499 runs at 83. After a poor Test series against South Africa in November 2007, he was dropped from the Test side for the home series against Bangladesh. In a bid to prolong his career in the limited-overs formats, he announced his retirement from Tests in February 2008 and played in the one-day side until the 2011 World Cup.\n"", ' May 2011 \n']",[],29.0,48,4,1586.0,170,36.04,3089,51.34,5,6,205,13,23.0,0.0,188.0,161,23,4483.0,141,32.48,5645,79.41,4,28,353,68,73.0,0.0,31.0,29,2,578.0,66,21.40,483,119.66,0,1,40,25,8.0,0.0,128.0,213,20,6048,212*,31.33,,,10,30,,,102.0,0.0,354.0,310,50,8709,141,33.49,,,7,57,,,135.0,0.0,201.0,186,30,4020,106*,25.76,2987,134.58,2,13,264,195,47,0,29.0,36,1960,1015,20.0,3/28,3/44,50.75,3.10,98.0,0,0,0,188.0,161,6114,4839,137.0,6/25,6/25,35.32,4.74,44.6,4,1,0,31.0,21,309,349,18.0,3/5,3/5,19.38,6.77,17.1,0,0,0,128.0,,12826,6446,204,6/32,,31.59,3.01,62.8,,9,1,354.0,,12259,9393,303,6/25,6/25,31.00,4.59,40.4,8,1,0,201.0,161,2964,3637,125,3/5,3/5,29.09,7.36,23.7,0,0,0,False,True,False,True

He was still only 19, with only one T20I cap behind him, and fresh from a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup when he was handed a Test debut against England in Napier. Southee responded with 5 for 55 before smashing 77 off 40 balls in the second innings with nine sixes. \n', ""It was a debut that gave a clear indication of the career to come. Over the next decade or so, Southee would go on to form one of the world's best new-ball partnerships with Trent Boult, and would also come to be known for his ability to clear the fence. He hit his 50th six in only his 36th Test, and could one day take the Test record for most sixes from his long-time captain Brendon McCullum."", ""Pace and outswing, however, are the main tools of Southee's trade.

Two years later, his 11 wickets in the West Indies, at 21.09, helped New Zealand achieve their first series win away from home, against anyone other than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe, in 12 years. In ODIs, his landmark performance came at the 2015 World Cup, when he sliced through England's batting with a sensational spell of swing bowling to finish with figures of 7 for 33, the best bowling figures for a New Zealander in ODIs.""]",['New Zealand Cricket Almanack Player of the Year 2008'],65.0,95,9,1550.0,77*,18.02,1755,88.31,0,5,154,68,46.0,0.0,139.0,84,31,669.0,55,12.62,670,99.85,0,1,53,26,39.0,0.0,58.0,25,8,148.0,23,8.70,107,138.31,0,0,12,8,25.0,0.0,101.0,137,12,2261,156,18.08,2624,86.16,1,7,233,89,56.0,0.0,153.0,95,32,823,66*,13.06,801,102.74,0,2,67,32,44.0,0.0,169.0,85,25,680,74,11.33,459,148.14,0,2,55,36,69,0,65.0,121,14510,7378,244.0,7/64,10/108,30.23,3.05,59.4,12,8,1,139.0,137,6967,6303,185.0,7/33,7/33,34.07,5.42,37.6,4,3,0,58.0,56,1224,1748,67.0,5/18,5/18,26.08,8.56,18.2,0,1,0,101.0,185,21056,10616,387,8/27,10/108,27.43,3.02,54.4,17,17,1,153.0,151,7694,6950,204,7/33,7/33,34.06,5.41,37.7,4,3,0,169.0,165,3611,4992,183,6/16,6/16,27.27,8.29,19.7,0,2,0,False,False,False,False

In only his third match, Taylor hammered a superb 128 against Sri Lanka at Napier and he followed it up with 84 at better than a run a ball in his first ODI outside New Zealand, at Hobart against Australia in January 2007.

With time on his side, he could one day creep up towards Hadlee's 431 Test dismissals, but to do that Vettori would need to avoid the stress fractures in his back that troubled him earlier in his career.

Among his best performances is his maiden Test double-century in January 2015, which helped New Zealand come from behind and beat Sri Lanka in Wellington. The innings was a testament to Williamson's hunger for runs and batting time - he was dissatisfied despite making 242 in over 10 hours."", ' \nWilliamson has made his orthodoxy work and is capable of scoring at a brisk tempo - he has a T20 hundred for Northern Knights and became the quickest New Zealand batsman, and fifth overall, to 3000 ODI runs. For a measure of his consistency, he has two streaks of five or more successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs in 20 months since 2014.', ' \nHe is rarely drawn to emotion and is a genial, but hard, competitor - Williamson once struck the winning six in a roller-coaster, one-wicket win over Australia in the 2015 World Cup, and celebrated with a smile and the calmest of fist pumps as Eden Park exploded in raucous jubilation.

He has done so coming from the cricketing backwaters, the mining state of Jharkhand, and through a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scales the highs and lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India have won the top prize in all formats: the No.1 Test ranking for 18 months starting December 2009, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the World Twenty20 on his captaincy debut in 2007."", ' \n', 'Dhoni, then a ticket inspector with the Indian Railways, had escaped all attention bar the odd whisper among the followers of club cricket in Kolkata until he was 23 when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi in 2004. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 within a year of his debut.', ""Dhoni demonstrated all that was right with the new middle-class India. He didn't respect reputations, but never disrespected. He improvised, he learned, but didn't make an apology about his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He still batted with low, hockey hands, he still didn't look elegant but became a multi-faceted ODI batsman, one who could accumulate, one who could rebuild, and one who could still unleash those big sixes."", ""Along the way Dhoni showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up captaincy in 2007. Just before that announcement from Dravid, Dhoni had taken a bunch of kids to South Africa and was leading India to a World Cup win in a format the country didn't even take seriously. The ODI captaincy was natural progression, and Anil Kumble just kept the seat warm in Tests for a year."", ""Dhoni brought to captaincy a thick skin and relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with coach Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they returned the favour with some of their best years in international cricket. His calmness on the field helped and worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although tactically he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests. All that can't argue against the fact that India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under Dhoni, and that Dhoni has for years been among the best few ODI batsmen in the world."", ""However, post the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and his patented helicopter shot, reality struck, and an ageing team kept losing in unfamiliar conditions. After eight straight Test losses away from home, Dhoni the captain came under immense pressure, which was accentuated by a 2-1 home series loss to England in 2012-13, the first time India had lost at home in more than eight years. This brought out a new chapter in Dhoni's career wherein he seemed more assertive as a captain, started building a new team, played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to win four wins in a series. "", '  ', ""Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came close to wins on both tours. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests, dealing with the seam movement and bounce by stepping down the pitch and taking blows on his body.\n \nWins once again proved elusive on the tour of Australia that followed, though India competed ferociously thanks to a young batting core led by Virat Kohli. "", 'Kohli had captained the side in the first Test, with Dhoni injured, and he would lead them in the fourth and final Test too, with Dhoni making a surprise announcement after the third Test in Melbourne that he was retiring from the longest format.\n \nThough his game was not as suited to Tests as it was to limited-overs cricket, Dhoni ended his career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper, with 4876 runs at an average of just over 38, and six hundreds. He had also captained India to more Test wins - 27 - than anyone else. ', 'Dhoni continued to lead India in the shorter formats, and they shrugged off a win-less tour of Australia by reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup. A year later, they won the Asia Cup T20 in Bangladesh but exited the World T20 in the semi-finals, at home. Dhoni enjoyed a good tournament as a finisher, scoring 89 runs while only being dismissed once in five innings; he showed electric reflexes while keeping to the spinners and indicated he could yet play on till the 2019 World Cup, though he gave up the limited-overs captaincy in January 2017. ', ' ', 'Dhoni has also found a new home in the IPL, having been the face of the Chennai Super Kings franchise for the first eight seasons of the tournament, leading them to two titles and four runner-up finishes. He became so deeply associated with the city that he even became a co-owner of a Chennai-based football franchise. But in 2016, with Super Kings suspended for two seasons, he became the first player signed up by the new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.']","['ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2008', 'ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2009', 'ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2011', ""LG People's Choice Award 2013""]",90.0,144,16,4876.0,224,38.09,8249,59.11,6,33,544,78,256.0,38.0,341.0,289,82,10500.0,183*,50.72,11992,87.55,10,71,806,224,314.0,120.0,98.0,85,42,1617.0,56,37.60,1282,126.13,0,2,116,52,57.0,34.0,131.0,210,19,7038,224,36.84,,,9,47,,,364.0,57.0,414.0,356,97,13080,183*,50.50,,,17,85,,,395.0,138.0,303.0,271,110,6205,79*,38.54,4573,135.68,0,24,429,272,160,78,90.0,7,96,67,0.0,-,-,35.33,4.18,-,0,0,0,341.0,2,36,31,1.0,1/14,1/14,31.0,5.16,36.0,0,0,0,98.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,131.0,,126,87,0,-,-,-,4.14,-,0,0,0,414.0,,63,53,2,1/14,1/14,26.50,5.04,31.5,0,0,0,303.0,1,12,25,0,-,-,-,12.50,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

That debut, in Mohali in 2012-13, came to Dhawan in his ninth year of first-class cricket after he had been written off by almost everybody, not least because India's opening combination had been fixed to the most prolific combination in their Test history: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. \n"", ' \nDhawan is one in a long line of stroke-players from Delhi, which became the Indian batting capital in the 2000s.

After lukewarm showing in the IPL and five ODIs, and with the Test openers going well, it seemed Dhawan would be left consigned to domestic cricket and T20 leagues."", "" \nFortune turned, though, and both Sehwag and Gambhir lost form dramatically, giving Dhawan a chance at the age of 27 with 81 caps and 5679 first-class runs to his name already.

He opened well in all three forms of the game. He could be more aggressive than Virender Sehwag, played the kind of back-to-the-wall innings that would do Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman proud, and accumulated without taking any risks, much like Sachin Tendulkar has been doing in the last quarter of his career. Either side of that period, though, livid disappointment with his technical flaws dominating his other attributes. Still, with over 10000 runs from his 56 Tests, 147 ODIs and 37 T20Is - not to mention leading Kolkata Knight Riders to two IPL titles - Gambhir has been a grand contributor to Indian cricket.', ' \n', 'Gambhir almost did not make it, ""not wanting to play anymore"" when he was dropped for the 2007 World Cup. For about eight first years of his career, he was the domestic cheque that would not be honoured at international level. While the bowlers on the Ranji circuit swore by this little left-hand batsman, he had just two international centuries to show after 13 Tests and 19 ODIs when he was left out of the World Cup party.', 'He came back with massive runs in domestic cricket, a few important technical adjustments, and with the reputation of being the best player of spin in India, outside the international side. A century in his second ODI back and a final-winning fifty in the inaugural World Twenty20 paved the way for his Test return. Test fifties against Murali and Mendis in the summer of Murali and Mendis in 2008 told him he belonged. In his next 13 Tests, he scored eight centuries: centuries to set up wins, centuries to bat opposition out, and centuries to hold on for draws, including the near 11-hour marathon in Napier. The Arjuna Award came his way, the ICC named him the Test player of 2009, but much more tellingly Sehwag called him the best Indian Test opener since Sunil Gavaskar. He scored a match-winning 97 in the 2011 World Cup final.\n', ""After the World Cup, though, began a more serious, almost terminal decline. As the Indian Test side went from sublime to ridiculous, Gambhir's failures went unpunished. In England and Australia, where India lost eight continuous Tests, Gambhir was a walking wicket, poking at deliveries outside off. From being a captaincy candidate at one time, he went to struggling to keep his place in the side. "", ' ', 'With the arrivals of M Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan, Gambhir was sidelined until an England tour in 2014 when he was called-up as back-up opener. But his return after more than a year out of international cricket ended on a sour note when he was dropped after four innings. Gambhir was on far firmer ground in the IPL - having been a mainstay at Delhi Daredevils and then going to Knight Riders for a record US $2.4 million in the 2011 auction. Gambhir went into the 2016 IPL with 39 fifty-plus scores - the second-most by an Indian in all T20 cricket.

Purists might mutter about a lack of loop and flight, but he is very much a product of his times where short boundaries, heavy bats and shorter forms afford little latitude to slow bowlers. Bowling with a windmilling, whiplash action, remodelled after he was reported for throwing, he deals by varying his length and his pace, and can turn it the other way too. His deadliest ball, however, is the one that climbs wickedly from a length, forcing a hurried jab.

But in 2008 his confrontation with Andrew Symonds created one of the ugliest controversies in cricket - he was initially charged with racial insult, which was reduced to abuse on appeal.

When he channels his natural combativeness in the right direction, he can be a fiercely competitive and dangerous opponent. He was expected to be India's lead spinner in the all three forms of the game after Anil Kumble's retirement, but following a run of poor form was dropped from India's Test team for home series against West Indies and the tour of Australia in the 2011-12 season. \n"", 'Harbhajan eventually made a comeback to the Test side, and became the 10th Indian to have played 100 Tests when he took field against Australia in Chennai.', 'However, he was dropped after the next Test and was banished to the domestic set-up.

No word describes Virat Kohli better. His passion for cricket has made him one of the best batsmen in the world across formats, and has also helped him grow into a ruthless captain. It's also passion that defines Kohli's emotional, effervescent and at times firecracker character. Virat Kohli does not hold back and that remains his strength. \n"", 'Kohli approaches 30 as the most relentless and popular performer in the sport. He is already a World Cup winner (2011), the Player of the tournament at a World T20 (2014) and has led India to a record eight consecutive Test series wins. Purely as a batsman he is already close to the summit: by his 29th birthday he had more ODI hundreds (32) than anyone apart from Sachin Tendulkar (49), and averages 49 or better in all three formats. He is the only batsman to have achieved this feat.', ""He is widely considered to be one of the four great batsmen of his era, the others being Australia's Steven Smith, England's Joe Root and New Zealand's Kane Williamson."", ""In 2012, four years after his India debut, Kohli forced the cricket world's attention upon himself. In the fourth and final Test of a dismal Australia tour for India, who were already 3-0 down, Kohli came to the fore with a composed 116 in Adelaide. It was his maiden Test hundred, and the only century by an Indian batsman on that tour. Later, in the ODI triangular that followed, he uncorked an astonishing, unbeaten 86-ball 133 to help India chase down 321 in 36.4 overs against Sri Lanka. Soon after, he made an ODI career-best 183 against Pakistan in a chase of 331."", ""There is no better batsman than Kohli in chases: he says targets allow him to think clearly and pace his innings. He is unique in that he allies this clarity of thought with a classical batting technique and a supremely confident mindset. A stable head, sure footwork and firm wrists are part of Kohli's arsenal, which helps him play an array of audacious shots."", ""Fluent all around the ground, Kohli is equally confident off the front and back foot. And he isn't shy to move away from tradition and take guard a yard outside his crease, as he did on the tour of Australia in 2014-15. Having been embarrassed by James Anderson in England, he made this technical adjustment on the advice of India coach Ravi Shastri, and scored four centuries including twin hundreds in Adelaide. He finished the series as the second-highest run-getter behind Smith, as Australia won 2-0."", 'Since then, and in no small measure helped by playing Tests at home, India have won series against South Africa, England, Australia and New Zealand while winning away in the West Indies and twice in Sri Lanka.', 'The biggest turning point - and probably the most pivotal moment - of Kohli\'s career arrived on December 30, 2014, when MS Dhoni announced his unexpected retirement from Tests following the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Kohli could not believe that Dhoni would no longer wear whites, and that he would now lead India. The second thought made him cry. ""If you told me when I started playing cricket that at 26 I will be Test captain of India... no chance,"" is how he later described his feelings.', '""A brat, arrogant and casual"" was how Kohli described himself in 2008, when he then became the second India captain to lift the Under-19 World Cup. He excelled in the IPL for Royal Challengers Bangalore, which put him on the world map and made sponsors line up at his doorstep, making him a brand even before he had established himself in international cricket. But as he steadily grew to become India\'s most dependable batsman, and not just a brand, Kohli realised he needed to rid of old, bad habits. He lost weight, gained focus and became a relentless force, supremely fit and quick across the turf, and perhaps the hungriest batsman in the world when it comes to converting ones into twos.', 'The IPL helped Kohli, like many other Indians, play positively. He is certain that his 52-ball 100* in a chase of 360 against Australia in the Jaipur ODI of 2013 (still the fastest by an Indian) was only possible because of his post-IPL mindset. In 2016, Kohli smacked four centuries in the tournament, having not scored even a single ton in his first eight seasons. When Royal Challengers finished as runners-up in 2016, Kohli was just 27 runs short of reaching an unprecedented 1000 runs for the season.', 'Kohli has played with men who presented him awards when he was a chubby-faced schoolboy, and some of the same men have ended up playing under his captaincy. Under Kohli, India have ascended to the No. 1 Test ranking and held onto it with an iron grip while also reaching the joint top position in ODIs. He has set his sights quite a bit higher, though: his quest is to create a legacy like the ones established by all-conquering captains like Clive Lloyd and Steve Waugh.\n']",['ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year 2012'],77.0,131,8,6613.0,243,53.76,11549,57.26,25,20,731,19,72.0,0.0,227.0,219,37,10843.0,183,59.57,11664,92.96,41,49,1019,116,111.0,0.0,67.0,62,17,2263.0,90*,50.28,1647,137.4,0,20,223,54,33.0,0.0,109.0,179,15,8862,243,54.03,15452,57.35,32,28,1044,34,103.0,0.0,261.0,252,40,12285,183,57.94,13200,93.06,45,57,1183,140,129.0,0.0,253.0,239,46,7911,113,40.98,5924,133.54,4,58,727,251,115,0,77.0,9,163,76,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.79,-,0,0,0,227.0,48,641,665,4.0,1/15,1/15,166.25,6.22,160.2,0,0,0,67.0,12,146,198,4.0,1/13,1/13,49.50,8.13,36.5,0,0,0,109.0,23,631,330,3,1/19,2/42,110.00,3.13,210.3,0,0,0,261.0,55,705,726,4,1/15,1/15,181.50,6.17,176.2,0,0,0,253.0,44,454,661,8,2/25,2/25,82.62,8.73,56.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He swings the new ball and reverses the old, he does well on flat subcontinent pitches and relishes the helpful ones away, and he controls all three balls well - SG, Duke and Kookaburra. He might not quite have the skills of Wasim Akram, who he has often been compared to, but mentally Zaheer has become as good as Akram. He knows how to get wickets, he has an intuitive sense of when to go for the kill, and once a batsman has shown him the slightest hint of a weakness, Zaheer preys on it ruthlessly. Unlike the Pakistan fast bowlers of the 2000s, though, he stays away from controversy and is pretty low-key off the field.\n\xa0 \n', ""Zaheer's career can be easily divided into three distinct sections, neatly segregated by injuries. He was all promise ever since he bowled Steve Waugh with a full delivery in the Champions Trophy in 2000. A mysterious injury in Australia in 2003-04 - hamstring at first and later discovered to be a nerve twitch - then tortured him for the best part of the next two years. Every comeback ended in a frustrating setback through a new injury."", '\xa0\nIn 2006, though, Zaheer, now with a shorter run up, a fitter body and a meaner mind, dazzled England with 78 wickets for Worcestershire, where team-mates started calling him \'Zippy Zakky\'. He was the perfect foil for Sreesanth in South Africa, and he then regained his status as leader of the pack with a match-winning display at Trent Bridge, as India won only their fifth Test on English soil. The new, lethal Zaheer was not only the leader of the Indian attack, he was one of the best in the world. With his guidance, India claimed the No. 1 ranking in Tests and the World Cup in 2011, which he called ""my greatest cricketing moment.""', ""\nZaheer was seen as a vital resource ahead of a lengthy Test season comprising a four-Test tour of England and then a four-Test tour of Australia in 2011-12. But a hamstring injury on the very first day led to India losing one of their premier match-winners, and also every one of those matches. It wasn't until Zaheer's return for the Johannesburg Test against South Africa that India could stem their run of Test losses overseas. At 35 years, he still had all the tricks but his pace was down and he looked rather spent even while playing the second of back-to-back Tests in Durban.\n\xa0"", 'There was no doubting how much Zaheer prized Test cricket though. He took a five-for in what became his final Test - the same one in which Brendon McCullum hit a triple ton - and ended his career with 311 Test wickets, second only to Kapil Dev among Indian fast bowlers.', '\xa0\nZaheer continues to do his bit in the IPL though.

A fellow Gujarati, Mahatma Gandhi, could well have meant to say this about Ravindra Jadeja. The best of observers ignored his steady left-arm spin at first, then he was ridiculed for his three triple-centuries in Ranji Trophy, the idea of Jadeja the Test player was contested when India gave him debut in 2012-13 against conventional wisdom, but in India\'s series win against Australia, Jadeja won them all over, not least by dismissing Michael Clarke five times in six innings. \n', ""\nThe ridicule of Jadeja's triples - more than any Indian has ever hit in first-class cricket - was actually an indictment of Indian domestic cricket, that a batsman proven to be limited in his days in international cricket could score triples with ease because of the quality of tracks and attacks. However, his record with the ball in ODIs, his fielding, and his rocket arm made him a valuable player in shorter formats, which showed when Chennai Super Kings paid $2 million to secure his services. In August 2013 he topped the ICC's ODI bowling rankings, becoming the first Indian to do so since Anil Kumble in 1996."", '\nShane Warne, his IPL captain at Rajasthan Royals, nicknamed Jadeja ""rockstar"" because of his confidence in his own ability, but his utility lies in his ability to do the dirty work. He is unerring in his accuracy, can bowl overs and overs without tiring, and maximises the natural variation available in the pitch. His fielding and his batting made him an easy pick as a third spinner in Tests in India, a ploy that worked like a charm in India\'s 4-0 win against Australia in early 2013. Clarke, one of the better players of spin going around, will testify, as will 24 wickets at 17.45 in what was his first full series.\xa0', ""\nWhen R Ashwin suffered a dip in form, Jadeja became India's lead spinner on the tours of South Africa and New Zealand in 2013-14 and the first part of their England tour of 2014. While he had his moments, such as a six-for in Durban and a breezy, match-turning 57-ball 68 at Lord's, his bowling was one-dimensional and rarely penetrative on most of the surfaces India encountered. He sat out the fifth Test of the England tour, and flew home early from the Australia tour of 2014-15 with a shoulder injury."", ""\nJadeja's bowling lacked both the accuracy and the bite of old when he returned for the 2015 World Cup, suggesting that his shoulder had still to recover fully.

In his first three matches of the 2015-16 Ranji Trophy season, all in Rajkot, on dustbowls prepared to maximise the threat of his bowling, he picked up six successive five-wicket hauls - apart from scoring two half-centuries - for Saurashtra. The surfaces that hosted the four Tests against South Africa gave lavish assistance to the spinners, and Jadeja was close to unplayable at times while picking up 23 wickets at 10.82 to help India to a 3-0 series win.', '\nWith the Super Kings franchise suspended for two seasons, the nuts and bolts of the team were dismantled ahead of the 2016 IPL season, with Jadeja finding a new home at Gujarat Lions.\n']",[],41.0,60,14,1485.0,100*,32.28,2299,64.59,1,10,149,40,31.0,0.0,151.0,101,33,2035.0,87,29.92,2416,84.23,0,10,155,37,53.0,0.0,40.0,18,6,116.0,25,9.66,124,93.54,0,0,6,2,18.0,0.0,94.0,138,22,5415,331,46.68,8868,61.06,10,25,577,97,82.0,0.0,204.0,145,45,3084,134,30.84,3574,86.28,2,15,231,64,75.0,0.0,213.0,151,52,2153,48,21.74,1761,122.26,0,0,151,73,78,0,41.0,78,11480,4548,192.0,7/48,10/154,23.68,2.37,59.7,7,9,1,151.0,147,7669,6245,174.0,5/36,5/36,35.89,4.88,44.0,7,1,0,40.0,40,811,983,31.0,3/48,3/48,31.70,7.27,26.1,0,0,0,94.0,168,23448,9538,402,7/31,13/126,23.72,2.44,58.3,17,27,7,204.0,195,10044,7936,235,5/36,5/36,33.77,4.74,42.7,10,1,0,213.0,185,3296,4258,137,5/16,5/16,31.08,7.75,24.0,3,1,0,True,True,False,True

But with all those gifts came a curse - his brittle body, which may well have contributed to him playing his last Test in 2004. Still T20 cricket, which has a cap of only four overs, gave Nehra a lifeline and at 36 he revived his international career because he had reprised the ability to move the ball at 140 kph, and became one of India\'s most successful bowlers in the 2016 World T20.\n \nNehra came out of his first full tour - to Zimbabwe in 2000-01 - with his reputation as one of the most promising new-ball bowlers on the international circuit vastly enhanced, and his performance in Bulawayo played a key role in India winning a Test outside the subcontinent for the first time in 15 years. He struggled to establish himself thereafter, as inconsistency and injuries saw him slip down the pace bowling list.\n \nThe high point of that difficult period came in the 2003 World Cup against England, where he scalped 6 for 23 and then threw up by the side of the pitch. Surgery on a troublesome ankle, and an indifferent tour of Australia followed, and Nehra\'s status as an automatic pick was lost. He pulled out midway through the 2005 Zimbabwe tour and had a succession of operations on his ankle that slowed down his career. He hit the headlines with creditable showings in the IPL, particularly in the second season, and was recalled to the ODI squad for the tour of West Indies in June 2009 and found his mojo again.\n \nHis 31 ODI wickets in 2009 were the most he had ever taken in a year, and he followed it up with 28 dismissals in 2010 to establish his place in India\'s 2011 World Cup squad. He bowled a match-winning spell against Pakistan in the semi-final, but his body failed him again - an on-field injury prevented him from playing the final, which India won to become world champions.\n \nIt was long thought that was the end of Nehra, but he willed himself back into contention picking up 22 wickets for Chennai Super Kings in 2015 - the most by an Indian fast bowler. ""I don\'t know what has happened. Whether it is my face, I don\'t know,"" he joked on being ignored by India\'s selectors in June. Six months later - and four years since his last appearance for India - he was brought back to the fold for a tour of Australia. With his help, India won their first limited-overs trophy Down Under and Nehra continued his fine form into the Asia Cup and the 2016 World T20. \n', ""Nehra was a key player for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the first part of their triumphant 2016 IPL campaign before an injury halted his season. He underwent surgery on his right knee in London, and didn't play any serious cricket for the rest of the year, but India's selectors retained enough faith in him to pick him for the T20 series against England in January 2017.""]",[],17.0,25,11,77.0,19,5.5,256,30.07,0,0,8,3,5.0,0.0,120.0,46,21,141.0,24,5.64,246,57.31,0,0,12,3,18.0,0.0,27.0,5,0,28.0,22,5.60,39,71.79,0,0,1,2,4.0,0.0,90.0,109,31,756,57,9.69,,,0,1,,,25.0,0.0,201.0,87,35,463,37*,8.90,,,0,0,,,37.0,0.0,132.0,28,15,69,22*,5.30,102,67.64,0,0,4,3,27,0,17.0,29,3447,1866,44.0,4/72,6/117,42.4,3.24,78.3,2,0,0,120.0,120,5751,4981,157.0,6/23,6/23,31.72,5.19,36.6,5,2,0,27.0,27,588,758,34.0,3/19,3/19,22.29,7.73,17.2,0,0,0,90.0,,16966,8832,303,7/14,,29.14,3.12,55.9,,14,4,201.0,,9701,8086,245,6/23,6/23,33.00,5.00,39.5,9,2,0,132.0,132,2845,3653,162,4/10,4/10,22.54,7.70,17.5,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

However, for a player of his class, the first six years of his international career were frustrating for him, the team, and the spectators, as the odd delightful innings was followed and preceded by plenty of failures. It all came together finally in 2013, when Rohit was promoted to open the innings in ODIs. The move turned out to be a masterstroke, as Rohit found form in the Champions Trophy, and then went into overdrive in the ODI series against Australia, scoring two centuries, including 209, only the third double in ODI cricket. That led to a place in the Test team, and Rohit responded by scoring centuries in his first two Test innings, becoming the fifth batsman to do so. A year later, he became the first batsman to hit two ODI double-hundreds, in an innings where he smashed the record for the highest score with 264 off 173 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens.    \n', ""For the first six years of his career, though, Rohit struggled to come up with the sort of numbers which would justify his talent. He first came to limelight when he exuded class at No. 3 in the Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2006. He took that class with him when he played for India in their triumphant World Twenty20 campaign in 2007 and the CB Series in Australia in early 2008, scoring two fifties, including a vital 66 in the first final in Sydney. However that ability to look good at the crease didn't translate into long innings in his first two first-class seasons for Mumbai. He kept making strides in the big league, though. He was bought for US$750,000 by the Deccan Chargers in the IPL, and made 404 runs at 36.73 including four fifties. "", ""He pressed a claim for higher things through two centuries in the 2008-09 Ranji final, a feat last achieved by Sachin Tendulkar and only four others before him. However, his lack of consistency meant he wasn't a part of India's World Cup-winning squad, and returned to national duty only when the top players were rested on the tour to the West Indies in 2011. There, he made his presence felt with consistent scores in the ODIs and the Man-of-the-Series award. But his form continued to fluctuate in the months that followed, and he remained one of India's most promising but unfulfilled talents over the next couple of years. All that changed in 2013, and with Tendulkar retiring from Tests and ODIs that year, Rohit looked set to be a permanent fixture in the Indian team across formats."", ""Then came the 2015 World Cup and Rohit ended up as India's second-highest run-scorer, with an impressive 137 against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals, further cementing his place in the top order. He added another feather to his captaincy hat when he led Mumbai Indians to their second IPL title in 2015.

Standing at 6\'4"", his rhythmic, high-arm action allowed him to bowl at around 140 kph. For one who started serious cricket at 14, his rise was rapid and he made his Ranji Trophy debut at 18. An injury to Munaf Patel provided him an opening during India\'s tour of Bangladesh in May 2007 but it was in Australia where he caught the attention, prompting Steve Waugh to call him the next best thing in Indian cricket. He showed he could move the ball both ways and his probing spell in the second innings in Perth, where he set-up Ricky Ponting, is the stuff of folklore. He continued to impress in the one-day series, clocking more than 150kph once, and ended as India\'s highest wicket-taker in the triumphant campaign.  \n', ""The glory days continued through his debut season, with a notable performance against South Africa, followed by 15 wickets in four Tests in the succesful home series against Australia in 2008, and a couple of strong shows in Sri Lanka in ODIs. By now Ishant was clearly Zaheer Khan's deputy in the Indian seam arsenal, but things have gone seriously wrong since. Some have blamed it on his being over-bowled, particularly on flat tracks in the IPL, while others point to a malaise that has afflicted all of India's new crop of fast bowlers. The fact remains that Ishant lost the most crucial aspect of his bowling - his pace. Without it, his natural short-of-a-good-length that had tormented batsmen of Ponting's calibre a season earlier lost its venom. Eventually the loss of pace led to a loss of self-confidence. The Indian selectors decided to be careful and began shielding him from the shorter formats of the game in 2009 in the hope that he would rediscover his zip. His struggle continued but given India's limited seam-bowling resources at the time, Ishant was persisted with, even after an ankle surgery in 2012 that put him out of action for months. When he completed 50 Tests in early 2013 he had among the worst averages for bowlers with 50 Test caps to their name."", ""Since then Ishant has somewhat revived his Test career. He was impressive on the tour of New Zealand, being the top wicket-taker in Tests with 15 wickets that included two five-wicket hauls. On his next overseas assignment, in England, Ishant was the hero of India's famous win at Lord's when he bounced out the England batsmen with his spell of 7 for 74, helping India to a 1-0 lead in the Test series. It was perhaps one of his best performances for India in whites.  "", 'He soon suffered a leg injury and was ruled out for the following two Tests. He did return for the fifth Test but his 4 for 96 was only part of an embarrassing innings defeat for India. He then went back to Australia, the country that had kick-started his career, but he could only manage mediocre performances in the three Tests he was a part of. His landing foot was proving to be a constant irritant to his fitness and the fast bowler picked up another injury, this time to his knee and was ruled out of the ODI tri-series that followed. Ishant failed to recover in time for the World Cup and was replaced by Mohit Sharma.']",[],90.0,124,43,627.0,31*,7.74,2211,28.35,0,0,71,0,19.0,0.0,80.0,28,13,72.0,13,4.8,203,35.46,0,0,6,0,19.0,0.0,14.0,3,2,8.0,5*,8.00,9,88.88,0,0,1,0,4.0,0.0,132.0,168,62,889,66,8.38,2954,30.09,0,1,100,3,29.0,0.0,123.0,45,20,174,31,6.96,368,47.28,0,0,12,1,26.0,0.0,120.0,30,22,55,9,6.87,75,73.33,0,0,4,1,28.0,0.0,90.0,161,17196,9155,267.0,7/74,10/108,34.28,3.19,64.4,9,8,1,80.0,78,3733,3563,115.0,4/34,4/34,30.98,5.72,32.4,6,0,0,14.0,14,278,400,8.0,2/34,2/34,50.00,8.63,34.7,0,0,0,132.0,234,24571,12557,426,7/24,11/51,29.47,3.06,57.6,18,13,2,123.0,120,5834,5154,178,5/21,5/21,28.95,5.30,32.7,10,1,0,120.0,120,2575,3356,93,5/12,5/12,36.08,7.81,27.6,1,1,0,False,False,False,False

Within a couple of years in international cricket, he was thought of as a possible successor to Kapil in the all-round department. There was talent to back the hype: cast your mind back to January 2006, when the lethal curve of his late swing consumed, off the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of the Karachi Test, Salman Butt, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf; or to the previous Test in Faisalabad, where his 210-run partnership with MS Dhoni steered India past the follow-on mark. \n', ' \nBut a number of factors, not least the constant injuries that Kapil miraculously avoided, meant Irfan never really fulfilled his potential, and by his late 20s was more or less confined to bits-and-pieces roles in various IPL teams.', "" \nIrfan was 19 when he made his Test debut in Australia, but already looked the part, bowling at a brisk pace and troubling quality batsmen with his left-arm swing. He played a big part in India's one-day and Test series wins on their revival tour of Pakistan in 2004."", ' \nHis batting soon took off and, under the management team of Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell, he was regularly pushed up the order in ODIs - with a promotion to No.3 immediately yielding a spectacular 83 against Sri Lanka in Nagpur. He was more than just a clean ball-striker, though, and his sensible, straight-bat approach often bailed India out of strife in Tests as well.', "" \nBut, either side of that Karachi hat-trick, his bowling form nosedived, with his pace dropping significantly, and he struggled to make both the Test and ODI teams by the time 2006 had ended. He was sent back from the tour of South Africa in 2006 to focus on domestic cricket. He made the 2007 World Cup squad but didn't figure in a single game during India's disappointing campaign, and was thereafter dropped from both the Test and ODI sides."", ' \nRecalled for the inaugural World T20 in September 2007, Pathan did not disappoint, snapping up 10 wickets at 14.90. His crucial spell of 3 for 16 in the final against Pakistan earned him the Man-of-the-Match award.', "" \nIrfan returned to the ODI side for the home series against Australia and Pakistan, and showed he had rediscovered his rhythm, based on which he was handed a recall in the third Test against Pakistan in Bangalore. He celebrated his comeback by making his first Test hundred. He was subsequently picked for the Test series in Australia, and came into the side for the third Test in Perth, where he played a crucial part in India's famous win - with five wickets and scores of 28 and 46 to claim the Man-of-the-Match award."", "" \nIrfan lost his place in the India squad in 2009 and subsequently struggled with loss of form and injuries. A back injury forced him to spend eight months on the sidelines after the 2010 IPL, and he missed the entire domestic season. That did not stop him from being bought for $1.9 million by Delhi Daredevils at the 2011 IPL auction in January. After a mixed IPL season, he impressed during the 2011-12 Ranji Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker after four rounds of the tournament. His performances earned him a recall to the national side when he was picked for the final two ODIs against the West Indies in December, 2011. He came into his own during the one-day series in Sri Lanka in 2012, finishing as the highest wicket-taker and most economical bowler. He played the 2012 World T20 - also in Sri Lanka - and played all of India's games in the tournament, before injury struck once more."", ' \nIrfan has played no international cricket since then, but remains, like his brother Yusuf, a sought-after name at the IPL. He has had stints at Kings XI Punjab, Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad, as well as an injury-ravaged 2015 season where he did not play a single game for Chennai Super Kings. With Super Kings suspended for two years, the new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants acquired Irfan at the 2016 auction for his base price of INR1 crore.', '\n']",['ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2004'],29.0,40,5,1105.0,102,31.57,2076,53.22,1,6,131,18,8.0,0.0,120.0,87,21,1544.0,83,23.39,1941,79.54,0,5,142,37,21.0,0.0,24.0,14,7,172.0,33*,24.57,144,119.44,0,0,9,7,2.0,0.0,122.0,179,29,4559,121,30.39,,,3,26,,,30.0,0.0,193.0,143,33,2454,83,22.30,3073,79.85,0,9,,,39.0,0.0,177.0,139,53,1966,65*,22.86,1567,125.46,0,2,144,70,44.0,0.0,29.0,54,5884,3226,100.0,7/59,12/126,32.26,3.28,58.8,2,7,2,120.0,118,5855,5142,173.0,5/27,5/27,29.72,5.26,33.8,5,2,0,24.0,23,462,618,28.0,3/16,3/16,22.07,8.02,16.5,0,0,0,122.0,,21034,10880,384,7/35,,28.33,3.10,54.7,,19,3,193.0,,9365,7898,272,5/27,5/27,29.03,5.06,34.4,7,2,0,177.0,172,3583,4529,173,5/13,5/13,26.17,7.58,20.7,2,1,0,True,False,False,True

With minimal footwork but maximum intent, he has piled Test runs at a faster pace than anyone in the history of cricket. Bowlers must always fancy their chances against a batsman who plays so many strokes; it's just that Sehwag fancies his chances against them much more. \n"", 'As a starry-eyed youngster from Najafgarh, where his family ran a flour mill, Sehwag grew up, like many others from his generation, wanting to be Sachin Tendulkar. Indeed, when he scored his first one-day hundred, filling up for his injured idol against New Zealand in Sri Lanka, he could have been mistaken for him: there was the same back-foot punch on the off side, the minimalistic straight drive and the wristy whip to the leg. And on his Test debut, on a fiery pitch in Bloemfontein, he matched the master stroke for stroke as they both blazed away to hundreds. But soon he emerged his own man, and not long after Tendulkar was playing a supporting, and somewhat calming, hand as Sehwag romped away to a triple-hundred, the first by an Indian, in Multan, bringing it up with a six. Two Tests ago, he had been dismissed trying the same stroke five short of what would have been his first Test double-hundred.', ""His uncomplicated approach - batting is all about scoring as many runs as quickly as possible - belies a sharp and street-smart cricket mind. He has a keen grasp of his own, and his opponents', strengths and weaknesses and exploits them in a forensic manner. What appears risky to many, is merely an opportunity for him, and his lack of footwork, which does get him in trouble against the moving ball, is mostly an advantage, for it creates space for his brilliant handwork. Few batsmen have hit the ball harder square on the off side, and fewer still have hit them as frequently. And the sight of a spinner brings the savage out in him: and for many spectacular assaults against the world's leading spinners, there have numerous outrageous dismissals against the not-so-reputed ones."", ""The most remarkable aspect of Sehwag's career of course has been his ability to build massive scores at breathtaking speed. He holds the Indian record for highest number of Test double-hundreds, and came within seven runs of becoming the first batsman to score three triple-hundreds. That innings, against Sri Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, epitomised the Sehwag brand of batsmanship: a mix of imagination, daring, power, skills, and clarity of vision. His ODI career doesn't have as many high points, and yet he held the record for the highest score in that format at one point, scoring an astonishing 219 against West Indies in Indore. The most remarkable feature of the innings was the ease with which he reached the landmark, completing his double-hundred with more than six overs to spare.  "", 'Sehwag is equally refreshing off the field and shares his views on the game in an endearingly direct and candid manner, a rare trait among contemporary cricketers. He is, in every sense, a true original.']",['ICC Test Player of the Year 2010'],104.0,180,6,8586.0,319,49.34,10441,82.23,23,32,1233,91,91.0,0.0,251.0,245,9,8273.0,219,35.05,7929,104.33,15,38,1132,136,93.0,0.0,19.0,18,0,394.0,68,21.88,271,145.38,0,2,43,16,2.0,0.0,194.0,321,11,14683,319,47.36,,,42,55,,,166.0,0.0,332.0,321,14,10454,219,34.05,,,16,57,,,120.0,0.0,159.0,157,6,4061,122,26.89,2747,147.83,2,24,487,147,42.0,0.0,104.0,91,3731,1894,40.0,5/104,5/118,47.35,3.04,93.2,0,1,0,251.0,146,4392,3853,96.0,4/6,4/6,40.13,5.26,45.7,1,0,0,19.0,1,6,20,0.0,-,-,-,20.0,-,0,0,0,194.0,,8614,4470,105,5/104,,42.57,3.11,82.0,,1,0,332.0,,6009,5154,142,4/6,4/6,36.29,5.14,42.3,3,0,0,159.0,28,358,496,22,3/14,3/14,22.54,8.31,16.2,0,0,0,False,True,False,True

An attacking left-hander who goes for the big shots with impunity and clears the field with a swashbuckling flourish when at the top of his game, Raina is also equally capable of attracting applause as an electric fielder in the circle.

The ability to split the field and discover gaps where fielders could not be placed earned him high praise when he first burst through to play for India in December 2006. The early years, however, weren't so prolific, which led to his omission from the 2007 World Cup. He forced his way back with a mountain of runs in domestic cricket, and from June 2008 was prolific in ODIs too, enhancing his stature as one of India's responsible gen-next batsmen. Also helping his cause were three supremely successful seasons for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL and in the Champions League. He was one of the four players retained by the franchise for the 2011 season."", ""His tenacity at the worst of times is typical of someone who has spent his teenage years living away from home in the demanding world of the Uttar Pradesh sports hostel, where a lack of facilities or grooming produces cricketers who must match talent with determination. At the under-19 level, Raina was prodigious with his run-scoring and a string of double-hundreds took him to the Indian junior team and beyond it, to India colours.

However, tempering his strokeplay has been his biggest problem, and has kept him out of the Indian team for long periods.   \n', 'Robust in build, Uthappa first caught the eye when he made a brilliant 66 in a losing cause for India B against India A in the Challenger Trophy in Mumbai in 2005 against an attack that included Zaheer Khan, Murali Kartik and RP Singh. In the subsequent edition of the same tournament, in Mohali in 2006, he cracked a match-winning 93-ball 100 for India B against an India A team. The reward was a place in the Indian team - in place of Virender Sehwag - in the final ODI against England early in 2006, and he capitalised with a well-paced 86 at Indore. After a spell out of the team Uthappa got a chance in the sixth ODI against England at The Oval. A nerveless unbeaten 47 off only 33 balls helped India seal a rousing win.', 'Uthappa was a part of the Indian squad which won the World T20 in 2007, but thereafter he had a poor year in international cricket in 2008, scoring only 179 runs in 11 ODI innings. That resulted in him being dropped from the Indian team, after which Uthappa had a few fairly ordinary years in domestic cricket. In 2013-14, though, he had a superb domestic season in which Karnataka completed a rare treble - winning the Ranji Trophy, Irani Cup and Vijay Hazare Trophy. Uthappa followed that up with an outstanding IPL in 2014, in which he scored 40 or more in ten successive innings and was the leading run-scoring of the tournament. The reward was a place in the Indian team for the tour to Bangladesh for the ODI series in 2014, where he made one fifty in a series of rain-interrupted matches.', 'He was left out again, but showed his appetite for runs was intact as he led the run charts in the 2014-15 Ranji Trophy season as Karnataka became the first domestic team to repeat their title-winning treble again. Uthappa made another India comeback during the limited-overs tour of Zimbabwe in July-August 2015, but with modest returns.', '\n']",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,46.0,42,6,934.0,86,25.94,1031,90.59,0,6,107,19,19.0,2.0,13.0,12,2,249.0,50,24.90,211,118.0,0,1,26,6,2.0,0.0,136.0,227,6,9118,162,41.25,,,21,51,,,129.0,2.0,189.0,183,11,6045,169,35.14,6480,93.28,14,31,,,107.0,9.0,238.0,231,20,6083,92,28.82,4523,134.49,0,35,622,211,114.0,39.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,46.0,1,2,0,0.0,-,-,32.91,0.00,-,0,0,0,13.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,136.0,,739,470,12,3/26,5/67,39.16,3.81,61.5,0,0,0,189.0,,272,266,5,2/19,2/19,53.20,5.86,54.4,0,0,0,238.0,1,6,11,0,-,-,-,11.00,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

His early efforts in first-class cricket also brought some success and not only with the ball as an unbeaten century showed that he is more than able to contribute down the order.

His bowling - the reason he was first noticed - is characterised by a galloping approach, accuracy, and reverse-swing. But it is his batting that is more likely to win matches. He boasts a prodigious array of strokes and is particularly strong driving through cover and mid-off off both front and back foot. \nHe has two gears: block or blast. Cut off the big shots and Razzaq gets bogged down, although patience is his virtue as he demonstrated in a match-saving fifty against India in Mohali in 2005. Just prior to that he had also played a bewilderingly slow innings in Australia, scoring four runs in over two hours. When the occasion demands it though, as ODIs often do, he can still slog with the best of them: England were pillaged for a 22-ball 51 at the end of 2005. and then again for nearly 60 runs in the last three overs of an ODI in September the following year. \n', ""It has hardly been smooth sailing though through his career. He suffered a slump, particularly in his bowling, between 2002 and 2004 when, though his place in the team wasn't under threat, there was uncertainty over how best to use him. But there were signs he was rediscovering some of his old guile if not his pace and nip. And if the pitch is in anyway helpful to seam - as it was in his first and only Test five-wicket haul at Karachi in 2004 or against India at the same venue in January 2006 - he can be a proper danger. Though Kamran Akmal's hundred overshadowed all in the Karachi win over India, Razzaq's performance was easily his most emphatic as an allrounder: he scored 45 and 90 as well as taking seven wickets in the match. A combination of injuries and poor form put his Test place into question and a knee injury days before the 2007 World Cup meant Pakistan missed his presence in a disastrous campaign. "", 'A lackluster comeback to international cricket against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi and mediocre performance in the practice matches saw Razzaq being omitted from the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 World Championship and consequently announce his retirement from international cricket. He then went on to sign for Worcestershire towards the end of the county season as well as signing up with the Indian Cricket League, which ruled him out of Pakistan contention. He took back his decision to retire but committed himself to the ICL for two seasons, during which he served the Hyderabad Heroes as one of their star players.

When all is not well, he looks so awkward you forget he can hit the ball clean and long. All has been well with Yuvraj more often in limited-overs cricket, where he can be effortless and brutal at the same time, than in Tests, though his form and consistency has been on the decline since his comeback following a recovery from a rare form of germ cell cancer in 2012. When he started off, though, his athleticism on the field and his canny left-arm spin made him a key one-day player as Indian cricket went through a makeover at the turn of the century. \n', 'Yuvraj\'s father, Yograj, who played one Test for India, was what Mike Agassi was to Andre. So obsessed was he with Yuvraj\'s cricket that he took a skating gold medal off his young son\'s neck and threw it out of the car. ""From now on, you are going to play cricket."" And from then on he has played cricket. The major shift came when, at 15, he carried kitbags in crowded local trains, living away from his parents and a luxurious life in Punjab. At 18 he was shredding a strong Australian attack, in only his second ODI, in the Champions Trophy in 2000.', ""Soon Yuvraj would become India's middle-order lynchpin, forming fruitful partnerships first with Rahul Dravid and then with MS Dhoni. Both batsmen, superb ODI operators in their own right, credited their success to Yuvraj's ability to score at will. Testament to Yuvraj's importance is that when he was dropped from the ODI side in 2010, it was the first such occurrence since he cemented his place in the Indian team. His ODI career is full of highlight reels, with the biggest impact being his contribution to India's World Cup triumph in 2011 - 362 runs, 15 wickets, and four Man-of-the-Match awards, and the Player of the Tournament. That put to shade even his awesome achievement in the World T20 triumph in 2007, where he famously hit a Stuart Broad over for six sixes."", ""However, his limitations have manifested themselves in Tests, where he has struggled both against the seaming and swinging ball, and quality spin.

He returned home after completing his chemotherapy in April 2012, fairly confident that he could resume his duties on the cricket field reasonably quickly and in August he was named in India's squad for the World T20 in Sri Lanka."", 'In January 2013, poor form and fitness led to his ouster from the team. But a visibly slimmer and fitter Yuvraj emerged from a training stint in France in October and hit an unbeaten 35-ball 77 in a T20I against Australia on his comeback. But lack of consistency meant he was out of the ODI mix after the tour of South Africa in December 2013.', ""Even as his form dipped, Yuvraj continued to be a hot pick at the IPL auction, picking up contracts worth over a million dollars in 2014 ($2.33 million or Rs 14 crore to RCB), 2015 ($2.67 million or Rs 16 crore to Delhi Daredevils) and 2016 ($1.04 million or Rs 7 crore to Sunrisers Hyderabad).

He made his first-class debut at the age of 19 and impressive against Lahore Ravi with a four-wicket haul in the first innings. His career started with club cricket and rose up to the regional Under-16 level but he did not make youth squads at national level. However, he managed to gain some attention in the 2015 National T20 Cup in where he picked up eight wickets in four matches under the captaincy of Shoaib Malik. His 17 wickets at 17.05 in the National One-Day cup in 2016 was a key part of him being promoted to the Pakistan side. Peshawar Zalmi head coach Mohammad Akram had been monitoring this process at the domestic circuit and snapped him form the emerging category in Pakistan Super League. \n', 'Hasan made a smooth transition to international cricket, grabbing two five-fors in his first 15 ODIs and impressing with his tight lines on his Test debut - which coincided with the farewells of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan - as Pakistan pulled off a last-gasp win in Dominica. Still, no one could quite imagine the impact he would have on his first global tournament, the 2017 Champions Trophy.', ""Much like his team, Hasan began the tournament badly, going for 70 in his ten overs in a heavy opening-match defeat to India, before turning his form around in unexpectedly dramatic manner. Taking three wickets in each of Pakistan's next four matches, he finished as the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 13 at an average of 14.69, while only conceding 4.29 an over. Hasan's ability to strike regular middle-overs blows was a key factor in Pakistan lifting their first global ODI trophy since the 1992 World Cup, and his Player-of-the-Tournament award richly deserved."", '\n']",[],9.0,15,5,155.0,29,15.5,165,93.93,0,0,18,8,4.0,0.0,44.0,22,6,203.0,59,12.68,198,102.52,0,2,13,10,12.0,0.0,29.0,9,4,61.0,23,12.20,35,174.28,0,0,3,5,7.0,0.0,38.0,56,18,594,50*,15.63,840,70.71,0,1,67,21,15.0,0.0,67.0,37,10,375,59,13.88,347,108.06,0,2,27,21,24.0,0.0,91.0,37,14,229,35,9.95,149,153.69,0,0,13,16,25.0,0.0,9.0,17,1737,896,31.0,5/45,7/83,28.9,3.09,56.0,1,1,0,44.0,43,2125,1862,77.0,5/34,5/34,24.18,5.25,27.5,1,3,0,29.0,29,597,835,34.0,3/23,3/23,24.55,8.39,17.5,0,0,0,38.0,63,7175,4020,157,8/107,11/94,25.60,3.36,45.7,7,9,2,67.0,66,3251,2825,121,5/34,5/34,23.34,5.21,26.8,5,3,0,91.0,90,1974,2472,122,5/20,5/20,20.26,7.51,16.1,4,1,0,False,False,False,False

Most often, he is used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the 26-year-old from Peshawar has qualities of his own that suggest he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often.  \n', ""A limited batsman but a technically sound keeper, Rizwan made his international debut shortly after the 2015 World Cup when the slot behind the stumps was still up for grabs. He made a bright start against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, averaging nearly 60 with the bat in his first eight innings, but against more challenging opposition, his deficiencies were quickly exposed. A lengthy lean patch followed, and once he lost his place to Sarfaraz for the World T20 in 2016, there was little doubt who Pakistan's No. 1 wicketkeeper was. After the debacle at the World T20, Sarfaraz was appointed captain of the limited-overs sides, and consequently Rizwan's game time diminished further, coming to a complete halt until Sarfaaraz sat out the last five games on the tour to South Africa earlier this year serving a ban. "", ""On the domestic circuit, Rizwan has been a prolific run-accumulator, averaging a shade under 50 in List A cricket and 41 at first-class level. He doesn't, however, seem to have the shots necessary to make him a valuable asset in T20Is, but with that being Sarfaraz's strongest suit, both as a batsman and captain, it would have been hard to dislodge him in the format at any rate. "", ""Having made his debut over a decade ago on Pakistan's domestic circuit, Rizwan has been an ever-present participant in the Quaid-e-Azam trophy, plying his trade with the hugely successful SNGPL side, helping his side to three titles in the last four years. For that, the reward of a solitary Test cap in 2016 feels somewhat inadequate."", ""He currently plays for the Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League, and having firmly cemented himself as Pakistan's back-up wicketkeeper, may yet get a chance to impress at the World Cup in England later in 2019.""]",[],1.0,2,1,13.0,13*,13.0,34,38.23,0,0,2,0,1.0,0.0,28.0,24,7,474.0,75*,27.88,543,87.29,0,3,40,5,29.0,0.0,13.0,10,2,135.0,33*,16.87,134,100.74,0,0,12,1,3.0,2.0,77.0,118,20,4089,224,41.72,7706,53.06,8,21,493,9,220.0,14.0,122.0,111,32,3888,141*,49.21,4394,88.48,8,20,339,43,116.0,15.0,86.0,66,21,1247,60*,27.71,1091,114.29,0,4,103,27,44.0,24.0,1.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,28.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,13.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,77.0,9,153,97,4,2/10,2/10,24.25,3.80,38.2,0,0,0,122.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,86.0,1,12,22,1,1/22,1/22,22.00,11.00,12.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He doesn't flight his offbreaks much, but his excellent control over line and length allows the captain to use him at almost any stage of an innings. He is also one of the better fielders in the Pakistan team, especially in the point region."", 'Despite these skills, Hafeez failed to create a regular place for himself in the Pakistan in his first seven years in international cricket, primarily due to his inability to convert his starts into substantial scores. He scored plenty of pretty 30s and 40s, laced with some exquisite cover-drives, but that only helped cement the opinion that Hafeez may forever remain a player whose potential exceeds performance.', ""To a large extent, that changed in 2011, as Hafeez put in consistent displays with both bat and ball in all forms of the game. It actually started in the series against South Africa in November 2010, and then continued through 2011, a year which fetched him two centuries in Tests and three in ODIs, apart from two fifties in Twenty20 internationals. He won an incredible ten Man-of-the-Match awards in international cricket that year, and became only the third cricketer - after Sanath Jayasuriya and Jacques Kallis - to score 1000-plus runs and take 30 or more wickets in ODIs in a calendar year. With Taufeeq Umar, he formed Pakistan's most stable opening combination in Tests, as his aggression at the top of the order became a perfect counterfoil to Taufeeq's defensive approach. "", ""Since then, Hafeez has continued to frustrate and amaze, and the frequency with which he can switch from one mode to the other is a large part of his enigma. By many metrics, he's one of Pakistan's most prolific cricketers, but arguably also one of the more profligate ones in the way he's handled his immense talent. "", ""The elegance of the full face of his bat, particularly when driving through the off side, means any runs he scores are more memorable than they otherwise might be - and there have been plenty of them; he's number 10 on the all time ODI runs list for Pakistan. There was a century against India in Dhaka that preceded a disappointing barren spell, and then a purple patch against Sri Lanka where he smashed three hundreds in four games in 2013. A swashbuckling unbeaten 57 against India in the Champions Trophy final may ultimately be his most famous innings, as it powered Pakistan to a total they wouldn't let India get close to. "", 'It is his usefulness with the ball, though, that has kept him lingering around the Pakistan setup for so long. His consistency gives his side another option, which explains the reluctance to drop him even when his stock skill - batting - is letting him down. He has opened the bowling for Pakistan on several occasions - particularly in T20 cricket - and briefly took on the mantle of lead spinner after Saeed Ajmal was banned for an illegal action. ', 'That curse, however, has plagued Hafeez throughout his career too, and he has found himself suspended for an illegal bowling action no less than three times. Tellingly, it is in those periods that his place in the side has been in the greatest peril, as his technical flaws as a batsman appear destined to go largely unremedied. He was ignored for a recent series in Zimbabwe, but for a player with 50 Tests, 200 ODIs, a shade under 100 T20Is, and countless comebacks, one would have to be particularly brave to be writing his eulogy just yet.

Over 2007 and 2008, he also emerged, still improbably young, as a hot pace prospect. Even before he went to England on an U-19 tour, he had been picked out as a special talent by Akram himself at a pace camp he oversaw in Lahore in May 2007. By 2010, he had become the hottest pace bowling prospect around the world - but within months his career was in ruins following charges of spot-fixing.  \n', 'He began in 2009 with an impressive showing on the domestic circuit, impressing with his whippy pace and swing. He took 55 wickets for National Bank of Pakistan in his debut season, and earned selection to the Pakistan World T20 squad. There he hit the big time, taking over from an out-of-sorts Sohail Tanvir and bowling with pace, accuracy and courage. ', ""He hovered in the high 80mphs, touching even 90 on occasion and was a crucial opening link in Pakistan's title run. He bowled several nerveless final overs and one absolutely crucial opening over, in the final, when he dismissed tournament top-scorer Tillakaratne Dilshan for a five-ball duck, peppering him with quick, short balls. He carried his form over to the ODI version, picking up match-winning figures of 4 for 28 against Sri Lanka in August before turning in consistent spells in the Champions Trophy. "", 'He picked six wickets on Test debut in Sri Lanka. Thereafter, over tours to New Zealand, Australia and England, he matured remarkably, building up his pace and both new-ball and reverse swing. The 2010 tour of England saw the best of him and he became the youngest bowler, at 18, to take 50 Test wickets. But his world crashed around him when he was implicated in a spot-fixing scam in which it was alleged that he had bowled deliberate, pre-planned no-balls in a Test. In February 2011 he was handed a five-year ban following investigations by an ICC tribunal. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to six months in prison at Southwark Crown Court.', ""After his release, Amir frequently expressed his contrition over the incident and co-operated with the ICC in spreading its anti-corruption message. Having been cleared to return to all forms of cricket in September 2015, he made his international comeback the following January, as part of Pakistan's limited-overs squad to New Zealand. On his next international assignment, the 20-over Asia Cup in Dhaka, he made waves once again, rattling India's top order with three wickets in a hostile spell of pace bowling. Amir's reintegration came full circle when he was selected in the Test squad for England later that year, setting up a comeback Test at Lord's, the venue where the spot-fixing scandal had derailed his career six years before."", 'However, it is in Test cricket, the format supposedly perfectly designed for him to express his wizardry, that he has disappointed most profoundly. Magical spells with the new ball have been all too fleeting, and his performances in the three countries where conditions are arguably best suited to him, have been largely indifferent. With the ball, he averaged 42.41 in England in 2016, 28.83 in New Zealand that same year, and 61.60 when Australia whitewashed Pakistan at the turn of the year. The prodigious banana swing from that titillating left-arm angle - and that quite beautiful bowling action - does come, but not nearly as potently or regularly as memory suggests it did in his teenage years. In other words, Amir, in Test cricket, has flattered to deceive. ', ""It depends on what he wants to be remembered for, though, because if he wishes to live for famous moments rather than a stellar career, he's got the biggest one tucked up already.

It shows in his batting, which reached unprecedented levels of consistency in 2011, and in his captaincy, which helped lift Pakistan from the depths of the spot-fixing saga in England in 2010. Taking over as leader immediately after that episode at the age of 36, Misbah's calm approach was exactly what Pakistan cricket needed after the tumultuous period it had gone through. \n"", ""As a batsman, Misbah can either defend dourly with unflagging patience, or irritate bowlers with his improvisations. It helps that his defensive technique is sound: that solid foundation has helped him bat for long periods in Test cricket. That aspect of his game was in evidence right from his first Test innings in 2001, when he survived over two hours to score 28 in Auckland. He should have played much more international cricket thereafter, but was held back by his inconsistency. For four years between 2003 and 2007, he didn't play a single Test, and only turned up for a handful of ODIs."", ""However, a run-filled domestic season, followed by club cricket in England and Inzamam's retirement from ODIs, prompted the board to award Misbah a central contract in July 2007. A month later, he was surprisingly picked, ahead of Mohammad Yousuf, for the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa. He repaid the selectors' faith by finishing the tournament as Pakistan's best player and nearly taking them to victory in the final. He continued the good run on the tour to India later that year, scoring two hundreds, each of which spanned more than 400 minutes. "", 'However, it was in 2011 that Misbah truly rose above the crowd and established his credentials as a top-class batsman ', "" a leader of men. He was in charge when Pakistan completed one of their greatest Test series wins - a 3-0 sweep over the then No. 1 side, England in early 2012. Perhaps it's his degree in business management that has helped him manage, and get the best out of, a team as unpredictable as Pakistan.""]",[],75.0,132,20,5222.0,161*,46.62,11726,44.53,10,39,511,81,50.0,0.0,162.0,149,31,5122.0,96*,43.4,6945,73.75,0,42,342,83,66.0,0.0,39.0,34,13,788.0,87*,37.52,715,110.2,0,3,45,26,14.0,0.0,242.0,399,47,17139,284,48.69,,,43,101,,,204.0,0.0,292.0,267,55,9941,129*,46.89,,,11,70,,,128.0,0.0,162.0,141,38,3491,107*,33.89,2997,116.48,1,13,226,139,65.0,0.0,75.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,162.0,1,24,30,0.0,-,-,32.91,7.50,-,0,0,0,39.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,242.0,,324,246,3,1/2,,82.00,4.55,108.0,,0,0,292.0,,144,179,1,1/10,1/10,179.00,7.45,144.0,0,0,0,162.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

He made his international debut in early 2008, in the home ODI series against Zimbabwe, and though he did reasonably well in his early games, he was dropped in 2009 and spent two-and-a-half years away from international cricket. He returned with his appetite suitably whetted, and 2012 was a particularly memorable year for him, as he scored two ODI hundreds against India, and followed up with one more early the next year to firmly establish himself at the top of the order. An aggressive batsman, Jamshed plays strokes all round the wicket, but also backs it up with sound temperament and an ability to convert starts into big scores. \n', ""Jamshed's talent was visible from his junior days, and he made a mark very early in his cricketing career. Following an impressive 74 for National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) on his first-class debut when aged only 15, Nasir Jamshed was selected for the Pakistan Under-19s side to play the visiting Sri Lankans. Scoring a 44 and a 204 on his debut, he helped his side draw that match after Pakistan had conceded a 253-run first-innings lead. Although he failed to replicate those performances for the remainder of the season, he remained part of the NBP squad as well as representing Lahore. Jamshed was also part of the Pakistan U-19 squad that successfully defended its title in 2006, beating India by 38 runs."", ""Jamshed's break, however, came in the 2007-08 season where he scored 800 runs in ten Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches with the help of three centuries and was selected to play for the Patron's XI side that took on the touring Zimbabweans. A 182 off only 240 deliveries was enough for his name to be shortlisted for the 15-probables for the ODI series. He didn't immediately make a huge impact in international cricket, but in 2012 he showed that all the talk about his early promise wasn't misplaced.""]",[],2.0,4,0,51.0,46,12.75,107,47.66,0,0,8,0,1.0,0.0,48.0,48,3,1418.0,112,31.51,1881,75.38,3,8,150,19,13.0,0.0,18.0,18,1,363.0,56,21.35,320,113.43,0,2,34,12,6.0,0.0,98.0,166,9,5831,182,37.14,,,15,28,,,97,0,146.0,145,7,4480,158,32.46,5307,84.41,9,21,,,50.0,0.0,111.0,108,9,2431,104*,24.55,1981,122.71,1,13,273,55,36,0,2.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,48.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,18.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,98.0,,12,8,0,-,-,-,4.00,-,0,0,0,146.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,111.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

Partly the problem is that he is capable, as a batsman, of fulfilling many roles with some competence.

He isn't pretty, though there can be pleasantness in his high, stiff-elbowed drives and lofts. Square on both sides he is precise. Further, he runs well. With his flattish, very modern off-spin always useful for more than a few overs and a wicket here and there - less so after concerns over his action - and an athletic and languid presence in the field, Malik should be far greater a sum of his parts than he actually is."", ""He was for long earmarked as a potential captain - the late Bob Woolmer thought him the sharpest tack in Pakistan's set-up - but a stint with the captaincy was troubled, unimaginative and ended badly.

Twenty20 is something he could've been made for and he is among the most lethal players of the format, having been player of the tournament for the inaugural edition of the World Twenty20 in 2007 and led Pakistan to the title two years later with matchwinning all-round hands in the semi and final."", 'Maturity has often threatened to gatecrash his career and leadership was a just reward, though it was taken away from him in 2011 after an immature spat; another retirement was announced but none of it will change much a truly unique career.']",[],27.0,48,1,1716.0,156,36.51,1973,86.97,5,8,220,52,10.0,0.0,398.0,369,27,8064.0,124,23.57,6892,117.00,6,39,730,351,127.0,0.0,99.0,91,12,1416.0,54*,17.92,944,150.0,0,4,103,73,30.0,0.0,113.0,185,4,5695,164,31.46,,,12,31,,,78,0,501.0,467,31,10881,124,24.95,,,8,58,,,153.0,0.0,303.0,260,34,4175,101,18.47,2711,154.00,1,9,312,237,88,0,27.0,47,3194,1709,48.0,5/52,5/43,35.6,3.21,66.5,1,1,0,398.0,372,17670,13632,395.0,7/12,7/12,34.51,4.62,44.7,4,9,0,99.0,97,2168,2396,98.0,4/11,4/11,24.44,6.63,22.1,3,0,0,113.0,,13657,7098,266,6/101,,26.68,3.11,51.3,,8,0,501.0,,22377,17253,510,7/12,7/12,33.82,4.62,43.8,5,11,0,303.0,298,6514,7248,333,5/7,5/7,21.76,6.67,19.5,9,2,0,False,False,True,True

Instead, he became the first Pakistan captain since the great Imran Khan to win a 50-over world title.  \n"", 'Sarfraz took over the ODI reins in February 2017, providing his side with rare single-minded direction and focus. In June that year, Pakistan went into the Champions Trophy as the lowest-ranked team and lost heavily against India to start off, but then went on a red-hot run to beat South Africa, Sri Lanka and hosts England, and finally India to claim the prize. ', ""A right-hand middle-order batsman, Sarfraz wasn't always the sprightly presence that bossed the Sharjah Test of 2014 - when Pakistan chased 302 in 57.3 overs to level the series. In fact, between 2007 - when he made his debut - and 2014, Sarfraz had played just four Tests, four T20Is and 26 ODIs. He was miles off being a regular in any of Pakistan's sides, and not nearly good enough to warrant a place as a specialist batsman; he hadn't scored an international half-century in all this time. It was an era when the Akmals - no less than three of them - had taken out a lease on the area behind the stumps. "", ""Sarfraz had appeared on Pakistan's radar initially by leading Pakistan's Under-19s to the World Cup title in 2006, scoring half-centuries in his third and fourth match. He broke into domestic cricket, where 523 runs in 10 matches along with 28 dismissals behind the stumps pushed him into the A team's tour of Australia in 2007. Then he was left in the wilderness. "", ""It took seven long years for the spotlight to return to Sarfraz, when he made 74 in Pakistan's total of 359 in the second innings against Sri Lanka in Dubai. The innings was in a losing cause, but it did establish him as the team's first-choice wicketkeeper. He averaged 71.20 over the next 18 months, and during this period also elbowed his way into the ODI side midway through the 2015 World Cup campaign with a run-a-ball 49 against South Africa. "", ""Since then, Sarfraz has been a man for all formats, steady with the gloves, aggressive with the bat and street-smart as a captain across formats.

A sting instigated by the "", ' led to a ten-year ban by the ICC, before on November 1, he was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court of conspiracy to accept corrupt payments and conspiracy to cheat. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison. \n', ""Until his downfall, Butt drew comparisons with the legendary Pakistan opener Saeed Anwar, because he is left-handed and possessed of some supple wrists, His drives and cuts  through the arc between extra cover and backward point were inevitably flicked, often scooped and it was a high-scoring region. He didn't mind pulling either and off his toes, he was efficient rather than whippy as Anwar was. Further, like Anwar, Butt's footwork didn't really hold him back. But in attitude and temperament Butt was more Anwar's long-time partner, Aamir Sohail. "", ""He had a confident  air about him, a spikiness and is one of the few younger players confident when speaking English. His breakthrough period was the winter of 2004, where he first scored an ODI century against India at Eden Gardens and then went further by scoring a fifty and a maiden Test century in Sydney later in the year. For most of 2005, he failed to build on that and despite another ODI century, also against India, doubts about his defensive technique and overt dash crept in, resulting in him dropping in and out of the team. But against England to end the year, he responded to criticism by unveiling a startling restraint and change of tempo, hitting a century and two fifties in the Tests, each innings commendably restrained. Though his consistency isn't up to the mark, he still remains a vital member of the Test team. Following the disastrous tour of Australia in 2009-10, where senior players were slapped with serious punishments by the PCB, Butt came through unharmed and was given the vice- captaincy for the Asia Cup and England tour in 2010."", ""He had made impressive strides at age-level matches before making his Test debut against Bangladesh in 2003-04, playing in the Under-19 World Cup and touring South Africa with Pakistan's Academy team, smashing 233 against the South African Academy side. His strokeplay has never been in doubt and he is capable of providing electrifying starts when needed but with the tightening of his defense, Butt could be one half of the opening conundrum that has so haunted Pakistan since...well, Anwar and Sohail left the scene."", '2010 became a significant year for him as he finally cemented his place in all three formats and eventually succeeded Shahid Afridi as Test captain. But after winning much praise for his leadership on and off the field - and leading Pakistan to Test wins against Australia and England - his career was rocked by charges of involvement in spot-fixing and, in February 2011, he was handed a ten-year ban (with five years suspended) by the ICC.

Ajmal didn't play his first Test till almost 32, but showed immediately that he belonged, taking five wickets in his debut Test against Sri Lanka in Galle in 2009.  \n"", 'His golden run, though, started in 2011, when he showed superb control over all his variations - the offspinner, the doosra and the subtle changes in speed and flight. Unlike many offspinners who change their line when bowling the doosra, Ajmal tends to bowl the offspinner and the doosra from around the same line - on or just outside off - which makes it much tougher for batsmen to pick his variations. In 2011 he was the leading wicket-taker in Tests, with 50 in eight matches. But the best series of his young career came early in 2012, when he destroyed the batting line-up of the best team in the world, England, taking 24 wickets in just three games at 14.70. In the process, he clearly won the battle of offspinners against the highly rated Graeme Swann. ', "" However, Ajmal first made his mark in international cricket in ODIs. He was called up for the 2008 Asia Cup, and soon after he had the Australians completely bewildered in the ODI series in the UAE; he gave away few runs and his doosra was almost unreadable. The ICC called him for his action, though it was cleared soon after. The pressure didn't get to him and immediately after, he played a crucial role in Pakistan's drive to the 2009 World Twenty20 title, regularly bottling up the middle overs with Shahid Afridi. He ended the joint second-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, with an exemplary economy rate as batsmen around the world struggled to get a read on his bag of tricks.

A Test average of over 50, a triple-hundred, a famous double-hundred against India in India, and a brilliant rearguard partnership to clinch Pakistan's 3-0 Test whitewash over England, leave no doubt about his quality and class. He is also one of the most successful fielders for Pakistan, and can bowl respectable slow-medium. As a captain, Younis has enjoyed success in leading Pakistan to the world Twenty20 title in 2009.\n \nMuch of his persona evokes the idea of the quintessential Pathan warrior - committed, inspired, capable, and bearing the burden of conflict with fortitude and poise. Born in Mardan, a prominent city in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Younis moved at an early age to Karachi, where he caught the eye of Rashid Latif and Saeed Anwar at Malir Gymkhana, one of the city's renowned sports clubs. The relationship with Latif blossomed into a nurturing mentorship, guiding Younis towards entry onto the world stage. After two impressive domestic seasons, he got a Test call-up, and marked it with a century on debut.\n \nStyle and aesthetics are not his strongest points. His technique relies on a good deal of bottom hand, which deprives it of the fluidity and grace that is typical of Asia's best batsmen. Yet when Younis gets going, he produces results in the face of steep odds.\n \nIndeed, the steeper the odds, the more Younis seems to thrive. His match-winning 267 and 84 not out in Bangalore came after a string of low scores prompted a sarcastic comment from the team manager that leaked into the media. His greatest captaincy feat - the world Twenty20 championship in England - was achieved weeks after Pakistan cricket had been devastated by the terror attacks in Lahore. And though his triple-century came at home on a flat track, the innings began under pressure when Younis, eschewing the nightwatchman, stepped out himself in the dying moments of the second day with Pakistan staring at a huge Sri Lankan total. Unsurprisingly for a rearguard specialist, Younis has emerged a master of the fourth innings. Among players with 1000 or more fourth-innings Test runs, his average is among the highest.\n \nAlong with these accomplishments, Younis's career has also seen turmoil. Inability to control infighting within the team and display tact with the PCB led to him losing the captaincy in late 2009, and he effected a moody refusal when circumstances changed and it was offered again. His nature is to be inward-looking and intensely focused, quietly fighting his way through. While this makes for a reclusive personality that shuns the media and runs afoul of officialdom, it has also been the source of Younis's batting strength and his extraordinary resilience as a cricketer."", ' \n']",[],118.0,213,19,10099.0,313,52.05,19375,52.12,34,33,1082,70,139.0,0.0,265.0,255,23,7249.0,144,31.24,9628,75.29,7,48,578,56,135.0,0.0,25.0,23,3,442.0,51,22.10,364,121.42,0,2,31,12,12.0,0.0,229.0,385,42,17116,313,49.90,,,56,64,,,243,0,351.0,331,36,9911,144,33.59,,,12,64,,,196.0,0.0,83.0,78,17,1864,71*,30.55,1589,117.30,0,10,144,37,34,0,118.0,31,804,491,9.0,2/23,4/50,54.55,3.66,89.3,0,0,0,265.0,20,284,288,3.0,1/3,1/3,96.0,6.08,94.6,0,0,0,25.0,1,22,18,3.0,3/18,3/18,6.00,4.9,7.3,0,0,0,229.0,,3620,2120,44,4/52,,48.18,3.51,82.2,,0,0,351.0,,1169,1127,28,3/5,3/5,40.25,5.78,41.7,0,0,0,83.0,7,104,136,6,3/18,3/18,22.66,7.84,17.3,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

When his international career came to an end in 2009, somewhat prematurely with his 30th birthday still distant, he proved himself a staple of the English county circuit, sharing his talent around six counties by the time Hampshire signed him for their T20 campaign in 2015.  \n', 'He was on the fringes of the Pakistan squad for a number of years though given the allrounders ahead of him - Abdul Razzaq, Shahid Afridi and even Shoaib Malik - limited his chances.  He could generate pace and swing and was always liable to turn a game even as his career entered the veteran stage. He was also a dangerous lower-order plunderer, good enough to strike five first-class hundreds as well as one in List A cricket.', ""His type of straight, full, skiddy bowling courtesy a slingy action accounted for Andrew Flintoff's wicket at an ODI in Karachi in December 2005. It has also helped him to nine wickets against England in a warm-up game earlier during the same series .  In that year he also took five wickets in six balls for Rawalpindi against the national champions Faisalabad in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. This had only been achieved three times previously in first-class cricket, by Bill Copson in 1937, William Henderson in 1938, and Pat Pocock in 1972. Arafat was the only bowler to take the wickets spread over two innings."", ""Yasir's first experience of cricket in the UK was for Scotland before he was recruited by Sussex in the 2006 Championship season. In his first three games, he took 17 wickets with two five-wicket hauls as well as scoring a couple of fifties. An impressive start to the 2007 county season with Kent, where he starred with ball as well the bat, saw Arafat being awarded a central contract for the first time. With injuries to Mohammad Asif and Umar Gul, Arafat was called up as replacement and made his Test debut against India at Bangalore in December 2007.

He loves to make room and thrash the ball through the off side, but the stroke that bears his signature more than any other is the one he developed for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 - the eponymously named ""Dilscoop"" shot over his head, which confounded bowlers and experts alike. \n', 'In fact, 2009 was a watershed year in his career, and a huge factor was his move up the batting order to open the innings in all three forms of the game.

Add his electric fielding, especially at backward point, and his underrated offspin, and Dilshan is a quality package. In 2011 he was named Sri Lanka's captain, after the resignation of Kumar Sangakkara, but his reign lasted less than a year, with Mahela Jayawardene replacing him after Sri Lanka's tour to South Africa in 2011-12. Like his team, Dilshan had had a poor run of form while he was captain, but his batting enjoyed a revival after being relieved of leadership, particularly in ODI cricket, where he was 2012's second-heaviest scorer, with 1119 runs. \n"", ' ']",['ICC Twenty20 International Performance of the Year 2009'],87.0,145,11,5492.0,193,40.98,8379,65.54,16,23,677,24,88.0,0.0,330.0,303,41,10290.0,161*,39.27,11933,86.23,22,47,1111,55,123.0,1.0,80.0,79,12,1889.0,104*,28.19,1567,120.54,1,13,223,33,31.0,2.0,233.0,384,24,13979,200*,38.83,,,38,59,,,356,23,449.0,416,54,14314,188,39.54,,,30,71,,,204.0,8.0,221.0,217,25,5193,104*,27.04,4228,122.82,1,34,633,110,79,3,87.0,76,3385,1711,39.0,4/10,4/10,43.87,3.03,86.7,1,0,0,330.0,204,5880,4778,106.0,4/4,4/4,45.07,4.87,55.4,3,0,0,80.0,25,258,313,9.0,2/4,2/4,34.77,7.27,28.6,0,0,0,233.0,,6501,3255,90,5/49,,36.16,3.00,72.2,,1,0,449.0,,7871,6303,152,4/4,4/4,41.46,4.80,51.7,4,0,0,221.0,116,1564,1892,64,3/16,3/16,29.56,7.25,24.4,0,0,0,False,True,False,True

A technically sound batsman with strokes all around the wicket, Chandimal also stands out because of the maturity he shows at the crease and his temperament to build and pace an innings. \n', ""He made his international debut when only 21, and impressed almost immediately, scoring 111 in his second ODI, against India in the 2010 triangular series in Zimbabwe.

He returned to the Test side at the SCG for the New Year Test, and hit an unbeaten 67, batting alongside the tail. Six weeks later he became Sri Lanka's youngest ever captain, at 23, when he was handed the reins of Sri Lanka's top-ranked Twenty20, and was also named Angelo Mathews' deputy in Tests and ODIs. He celebrated his elevation with back-to-back Test hundreds against Bangladesh at home. "", ""Chandimal's rise to the national team came after consistent performances with bat and gloves at age-level cricket.

Most of the time during that period, though, his role was to bowl long spells block the runs and build pressure on the batsmen, allowing Murali to work his magic from the other end.', ""Since Murali's retirement, Herath has been Sri Lanka's go-to bowler. His unrelenting accuracy, and his ability to subtly vary his pace and flight have made him a potent force even overseas, where conditions don't always favour spin bowling. On Sri Lanka's tour to South Africa in 2011-12, Herath's match haul of 9 for 128 helped the team to their first Test win in South Africa. Next season he also had an impressive tour of Australia, bowling long spells, taking wickets and keeping the runs in check when the fast bowlers struggled to exercise any sort of control. He was the leading wicket-taker in Tests in 2012, with 60 at an average of 23.61, thus proving conclusively that he had broken out of Murali's shadow, and was among the best left-arm spinners going around."", '\n']",[],93.0,144.0,28.0,1699.0,80*,14.64,3405.0,49.89,0.0,3.0,201.0,6.0,24.0,0.0,71.0,30,15,140.0,17*,9.33,217,64.51,0,0,10,2,14.0,0.0,17.0,6,3,8.0,3,2.66,12,66.66,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,270.0,396,89,5021,80*,16.35,,,0,15,,,109.0,0.0,190.0,111,48,1043,88*,16.55,,,0,1,,,44.0,0.0,53.0,26,7,77,9,4.05,,,0,0,,,8,0,93.0,170,25993,12157,433.0,9/127,14/184,28.07,2.80,60.0,20,34,9,71.0,67,3242,2362,74.0,4/20,4/20,31.91,4.37,43.8,1,0,0,17.0,17,365,373,18.0,5/3,5/3,20.72,6.13,20.2,0,1,0,270.0,,59620,27160,1080,9/127,,25.14,2.73,55.2,,70,14,190.0,,8256,5732,226,4/19,4/19,25.36,4.16,36.5,5,0,0,53.0,51,1110,1129,57,5/3,5/3,19.80,6.10,19.4,0,1,0,False,False,False,False

His sheer quality as a batsman was never in doubt even when he just entered the international scene, but for Jayawardene the biggest challenge has been to justify all the early hype. With over 10,000 runs in both Tests and ODIs - and a captaincy stint that included a World Cup final appearance - it can safely be said that he has met that challenge more than adequately. \n', 'Blessed with excellent hand-eye coordination and a fine technique, Jayawardene scores his runs all around the wicket. Among his favourite strokes are the languid cover-drive - often with minimal footwork but precise placement and timing - and the wristy flick off his legs, but there are several others he plays with equal felicity. The most memorable are the cuts and dabs he plays behind the stumps, mostly off spinners, but also against quick bowling, when bat makes contact with ball delightfully late. Apart from his artistry, what stands out about his batting is his hunger for big scores, most apparent in his record 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara, but also in the regularity with which he notches up Test double-hundreds. And his century against Zimbabwe in the World Twenty20 in 2010 was a shining example of traditional methods succeeding in a new format.', 'Jayawardene is easily one of the most elegant batsmen of his generation, but the major drawback in his career is his relative lack of success in overseas conditions. His averages in Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are all less than 35, but at home he averages more than 60.', ""In the second half of his career, Jayawardene grew into an astute captain who read the game well and wasn't afraid to take risks. Under him, Sri Lanka shed their diffident approach, winning Tests in England and New Zealand, and - in what was Jayawardene's greatest achievement as captain - reached the final of the 2007 World Cup. He quit captaincy in February 2009, but agreed to a second stint, taking over from Tillakaratne Dilshan after the tour to South Africa in 2011-12, but resigned again after a year, handing the reins to Angelo Mathews. "", 'His limited overs batting has improved with age, and an increasing stroke repertoire has seen Jayawardene become almost as impressive an innovator at the crease, as he is a technician. An unbeaten 103 from 88 balls in the 2011 World Cup final made plain his limited  overs prowess, and marked him out as a big-match player, having already made a century in the semi-final of the same tournament four years ago. \n']",['ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2013'],149.0,252.0,15.0,11814.0,374,49.84,22959.0,51.45,34.0,50.0,1387.0,61.0,205.0,0.0,448.0,418,39,12650.0,144,33.37,16020,78.96,19,77,1119,76,218.0,0.0,55.0,55,8,1493.0,100,31.76,1121,133.18,1,9,173,33,17.0,0.0,237.0,383,24,17838,374,49.68,,,51,80,,,305.0,0.0,546.0,509,51,15421,163*,33.67,,,21,95,,,265.0,0.0,222.0,214,27,5479,116,29.29,4150,132.02,3,36,634,136,75,0,149.0,22,589,310,6.0,2/32,2/32,51.66,3.15,98.1,0,0,0,448.0,28,593,563,8.0,2/56,2/56,70.37,5.69,74.1,0,0,0,55.0,1,6,8,0.0,-,-,-,8.0,-,0,0,0,237.0,,3001,1629,52,5/72,,31.32,3.25,57.7,,1,0,546.0,,1280,1146,24,3/25,3/25,47.75,5.37,53.3,0,0,0,222.0,5,75,97,3,2/22,2/22,32.33,7.76,25.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Think of him now and you think of forearms straight out of a smithy, shots hammered through point and cover and scythes over the leg side. You recall a man who could score equally briskly in every form of the game, who slashed and burned his way through bowling attacks. As with anyone who relied so much on extraordinary hand-eye coordination, there were troughs and lean times, but just as the obit writers got busy, he would produce another innings of supreme power. The bowling, always canny and relying more on variations in pace than sharp turn, became the supporting act, though 440 international wickets should tell you that he was pretty adept at what he did. \n"", ""Following Mark Greatbatch's success at the 1992 World Cup, most teams were rethinking the way they approached the one-day game and Jayasuriya, who had trawled the lower reaches of the middle order till then, had his first stint as opener during the Hero Cup in India in 1993. It was only during a home series against Pakistan the following year that he established himself in the role and by the time the World Cup rolled around 18 months later, he had already chalked up his first century in whites, a frenetic stroke-filled effort in Adelaide. "", ""The years that followed were both prolific and successful. People remember Aravinda de Silva's magical innings from the semi-final and final of  the 1996 World Cup but it was Jayasuriya's withering assaults that deflated India in Delhi and England in the last eight. Soon after, he began to exact as heavy a toll on Test attacks, scoring at such a pace that Muttiah Muralitharan and friends had ample time to work their way through opposition batsmen."", ""After Arjuna Ranatunga's ouster, there was a four-year stint as captain that ended with a semi-final appearance at the 2003 World Cup, and just as the whispers grew about diminishing returns with the bat, he had one of his most successful years in 2004. There was a retirement announcement  in 2006, but he was back within weeks, and the walk off the Test stage came only 18 months later, after a typically cavalier innings in Kandy."", ""The one-day flame continued to burn bright, and took Sri Lanka to another World Cup final in 2007, and he was instrumental in the Asia Cup win of 2008, a couple of months after it had seemed that the selectors' axe had fallen for the final time. The Indian Premier League gave him a new platform to showcase his big-hitting talent, but failure to replicate the success of the first season in subsequent campaigns was the surest sign that time had finally caught up with a man who was still pounding out one-day hundreds at the age of 39. "", 'His election as a Member of Parliament in April 2010 and his subsequent failure at the World Twenty20 suggested that his international career may be at an end, but he made the longlist for the 30-man squad for the 2011 World Cup, before being recalled to the one-day side for the series in England two weeks shy of his 42nd birthday.']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1997'],110.0,188.0,14.0,6973.0,340,40.07,,,14.0,31.0,910.0,59.0,78.0,0.0,445.0,433,18,13430.0,189,32.36,14725,91.20,28,68,1500,270,123.0,0.0,31.0,30,3,629.0,88,23.29,487,129.15,0,4,76,23,4.0,0.0,265.0,419,33,14819,340,38.39,,,29,70,,,162.0,0.0,557.0,542,25,16128,189,31.19,,,31,82,,,153.0,0.0,111.0,109,7,2317,114*,22.71,1654,140.08,1,12,252,114,21,0,110.0,140,8188,3366,98.0,5/34,9/74,34.34,2.46,83.5,6,2,0,445.0,368,14874,11871,323.0,6/29,6/29,36.75,4.78,46.0,8,4,0,31.0,24,371,456,19.0,3/21,3/21,24.00,7.37,19.5,0,0,0,265.0,,15275,6808,205,5/34,,33.20,2.67,74.5,,2,0,557.0,,18167,14396,413,6/29,6/29,34.85,4.75,43.9,12,5,0,111.0,92,1593,1983,77,4/24,4/24,25.75,7.46,20.6,1,0,0,False,True,False,True

That he is a rare talent has never been in doubt, but in international cricket, that raw ability has not usually translated into runs. Perhaps his fans will argue that he was asked to bat too low in limited-overs cricket to have a major impact on the game. Nevertheless, his returns were modest, and his place in the side became untenable, for a few years at least.  \n', 'Kapugedara has, however, enjoyed something of a renaissance in T20 cricket, after he was picked in the national side again in 2015.

Following a prolific 2003-04 season, where he scored over 1000 runs, he was picked for the U-19 tour to Pakistan the following year and had excelled with a stunning knock of 131 in a one-dayer against the world champions. "", 'It was an innings he had rated as one of his best although he batted equally well for 70 in his first game for Sri Lanka A against the strong New Zealand A team in 2005. The selectors, desperate to unearth new talent, eventually gambled on an early promotion and fast-tracked him into the national squad after several glowing reports from development coaches.', ""Kapugedera's father, also a former Dharmaraja cricketer, provided early coaching and all the encouragement he needed to develop. David Karunaratne (his first coach) and Sumithra Warnakulasuriya (his U-19 coach) also played important roles in shaping Kapugedera's career. He was first picked in the national squad against India in November but pulled out of the tour with an injury. However, he made his ODI debut, aged just 18, against Australia in Perth in 2006, immediately impressing with his composure. \n"", '\n']",[],8.0,15.0,3.0,418.0,96,34.83,786.0,53.18,0.0,4.0,48.0,7.0,6.0,0.0,102.0,84,7,1624.0,95,21.09,2254,72.04,0,8,117,28,31.0,0.0,43.0,38,7,703.0,50,22.67,591,118.95,0,1,58,25,17.0,0.0,84.0,128,14,3919,158,34.37,6446,60.79,8,23,406,45,75.0,3.0,247.0,210,23,5363,161*,28.67,6482,82.73,5,31,,,95.0,4.0,124.0,111,13,2022,96*,20.63,1562,129.44,0,7,149,87,54,1,8.0,1,12,9,0.0,-,-,35.33,4.50,-,0,0,0,102.0,10,264,225,2.0,1/24,1/24,112.5,5.11,132.0,0,0,0,43.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,84.0,43,884,575,8,1/1,2/20,71.87,3.90,110.5,0,0,0,247.0,,801,683,14,4/41,4/41,48.78,5.11,57.2,1,0,0,124.0,11,124,173,7,3/14,3/14,24.71,8.37,17.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

For the believers, he's among the greatest to ever spin a ball. For the doubters, he's a charlatan undeserving of the game's greatest records, responsible for changes in the laws that they think have legitimised throwing. What was undeniable was his ability to turn the ball sharply on just about any surface, and bowl the sort of marathon spells that would have seen a lesser man retire after five seasons rather than 18. Whether Sri Lanka played at home, on pitches where he was often unplayable, or overseas, Murali was the go-to man for half a dozen captains. He seldom disappointed. \n"", ""Scion of a family with confectionery interests in Kandy, he first came to prominence during a tour game against Australia in 1992-93, when no less a batsman than Allan Border failed to pick him. From the outset, his action was an object of wonder or ridicule, depending on which side of the fence you stood. A deformed elbow was only part of the story. Murali had exceptionally supple wrists and a shoulder that rotated as rapidly as a fast bowler's at the time of delivery. A combination of all these factors combined to enable him to turn the ball far more than most orthodox finger-spinners, but it was only with his mastering the doosra, the one that went the other way or held its line, that he became Shane Warne's rival in the wicket-taking and greatness stakes. "", 'The controversies always kept him company, yet Murali seldom lost his wide-eyed smile, or the ability to run through batting sides. Darrell Hair called him for throwing on Boxing Day in 1995, and Ross Emerson followed suit three years later. In 2004, he was asked to refrain from bowling his doosra, after it was found to exceed the 15-degree tolerance limit that had been agreed on after extensive analysis of his and other actions. While the sceptics continued to denigrate his achievements, Murali even bowled on television in a special cast, going through his entire repertoire to try and convince the doubters.', ""Part of the World Cup-winning side in 1996, he was instrumental in the run to the final 11 years later, and he played his part in some of the country's greatest sporting moments. It was his 16 wickets that helped rout England at The Oval in 1998, back in the days when Sri Lanka were deemed worthy of only one Test. He averaged less than 30 with the ball in every country except India and Australia, and he finished a remarkable Test career with more than 100 wickets against India, England and South Africa. "", 'Backed to the hilt by Arjuna Ranatunga, he blossomed in the late 1990s, and there was a period when the opposition routinely budgeted for 20 Murali wickets or more in a three-Test series. As the years passed, his shyness gave way to a quiet confidence and wry sense of humour, and he won admirers around the world for the energy, time and money that he invested in reconstruction after a tsunami had devastated the Sri Lankan coast in 2004. Often the only Tamil in the side in a time of ethnic conflict, he became as powerful a unifying force as any in the country. That he was such a hero with ball in hand was only part of the story.', '\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1999'],133.0,164.0,56.0,1261.0,67,11.67,1794.0,70.28,0.0,1.0,146.0,29.0,72.0,0.0,350.0,162,63,674.0,33*,6.8,869,77.56,0,0,50,12,130.0,0.0,12.0,2,0,1.0,1,0.50,5,20.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,232.0,276,83,2192,67,11.35,,,0,1,,,123.0,0.0,453.0,205,76,945,33*,7.32,,,0,0,,,159.0,0.0,164.0,38,14,81,11,3.37,110,73.63,0,0,3,2,31,0,133.0,230,44039,18180,800.0,9/51,16/220,22.72,2.47,55.0,45,67,22,350.0,341,18811,12326,534.0,7/30,7/30,23.08,3.93,35.2,15,10,0,12.0,12,282,297,13.0,3/29,3/29,22.84,6.31,21.6,0,0,0,232.0,,66933,26997,1374,9/51,,19.64,2.42,48.7,,119,34,453.0,,23734+,15270,682,7/30,7/30,22.39,3.85*,35.1*,17,12,0,164.0,164,3705,3945,179,4/16,4/16,22.03,6.38,20.6,3,0,0,False,False,False,False

He has risen quickly since earning wide acclaim with an acrobatic save in the 2009 World Twenty20, and in February 2013, became Sri Lanka's youngest ever Test captain at 25, after having been groomed for the post for two years.  \n"", ""In limited overs cricket, Mathews' all-round skills are almost indispensable. When he pulled a quad in the World Cup semi-final in 2011, he forced three changes to the XI that played in the final, as the team strove for the balance he single-handedly delivers. He began his international career with ambitions of becoming a genuine allrounder, but has since given primacy to his batting, and effectively plays as a specialist batsman in the Test side. "", ""Often coming to the crease at No. 6, Mathews provides solidity to the lower-middle order, which had been a weakness for Sri Lanka prior to his arrival. In ODIs he has provided two unforgettable finishes - against Australia in 2010, and Pakistan in 2012 - stealing victory with a sublime, sustained assaults, but his best work has come in the Test format. In an outstanding 2014, in which he scored 1160 runs at an average of 77.33, Mathews' finest moment was the rousing 160 at Headingley, which transformed that match and saw Sri Lanka win their first Test series in England (not including the one-off Test in 1998). "", ""Mathews' appointment to the captaincy has heralded a renewed focus on youth and development by the Sri Lanka selectors.

That yorker, a deceptive slower ball, and an excellent bouncer formed the body of Malinga's menace, while the action made his deliveries hard to pick up. All that ability was also set off by street smarts; Malinga was rarely shy to switch up plans, and reshuffle fields. Even when batsmen thought they knew what was about to come, Malinga retained the capacity to surprise. \n"", 'Found in his teens playing soft-ball cricket on the beaches of Rathgama, just north of Galle, Malinga became one of the poster boys for the informal Sri Lankan coaching system and its philosophy of equipping unconventional bowlers, rather than remaking them. Malinga has repeatedly credited Champaka Ramanayake for his success. It was Ramanayake who initially took interest in him, and with whom he developed the yorker that became the foundation of his career. The coach would glue a pair of shoes near the popping crease. Malinga would spend hours bowling at them. ', 'Initially picked for his pace, Malinga toured Australia with the Sri Lanka team in 2004, where he claimed 6 for 90 in a tour match and went on to make his Test debut - he dismissed Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in the same over, in Darwin. During an impressive tour of New Zealand the following year, his low-slung action resulted in the New Zealand batsmen asking the umpire to change the colour of their trousers as the ball was getting lost.', ""But it was in the shorter formats that destiny beckoned Malinga. He became the first - and, so far, only - bowler to claim four wickets in four balls, when he took Sri Lanka to the brink of victory against South Africa, in the 2007 World Cup. He has two more ODI hat-tricks - against Australia and Kenya - and he quickly established himself as Sri Lanka's limited-overs spearhead. Though Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan also played important roles, Malinga was arguably the single-most important player in Sri Lanka's excellent run in global tournaments from 2007-2014."", 'It is felt Malinga never realised his full potential in Tests, though perhaps through no fault of his own. He was only the third player to reach 100 Test wickets for Sri Lanka but a knee injury in 2008 laid him low for two years. He was picked again for Muttiah Muralitharan\'s farewell series, but again found himself injured for a period of some months. In April 2011, at the age of 27, Malinga announced his Test retirement, citing the desire to manage his ""chronic knee injury"" and extend his limited-overs career. It is thought his unique bowling action places a substantial load on the joints in his hips and legs. However, the fact that he announced his retirement while playing for Mumbai Indians in the IPL rankled at home. Through the forthcoming years, Malinga would go on to have a complicated relationship with Sri Lankan fans and media. In that time, he also became one of the IPL\'s iconic figures, representing Mumbai throughout.', ""Malinga's finest moment came during the 2014 World T20, in which he nominally captained the side through the knockouts but, more importantly, delivered a clinical final spell to muzzle the India middle order. Sri Lanka would go on to win that title but, before long, Malinga's career became threatened by fitness issues - both involuntary and self-inflicted. In late 2014, a long-standing ankle complaint deteriorated to the extent that it required surgery. Malinga was a diminished force through the 2015 World Cup and became significantly slower in his later years, in which he also put on weight. "", ""He stepped down as T20 captain ahead of Sri Lanka's 2016 World T20 campaign, again owing to a chronic knee injury, this time in his left leg. He has at times suggested that his career hangs in the balance as a result of these injuries. At others he has said he wishes to play on for another few years.

He began with a promising 54 on his ODI debut against Australia. His mannerisms while batting - particularly bow-legged stance and the flamboyant cover drives - immediately attracted comparisons with the great Aravinda de Silva. But despite being prodigiously talented, he failed to nail down a regular place during tours to Sharjah (1999), Zimbabwe (1999), Pakistan (2000) and England (2002). After the England tour he dropped out of the selectors' radar and returned to domestic cricket where he captained Panadura Cricket Club. Over the next four years he was a prolific run-scorer, especially after a move to Sebastianites for the 2004-05 season. Eventually he caught the eye of Tom Moody, who could not understand why he was not in the national squad. A quick promotion back into the Sri Lanka A team followed and after a successful tour to India he won a long overdue international recall. Still just 27, he was a surprise selection for the New Zealand tour and was handed his maiden cap in the first Test at Christchurch. It was an inauspicious start as he bagged a pair and Sri Lanka lost by five wickets. Sri Lanka's team management, however, kept faith for the second Test in Wellington and he rewarded them handsomely, scoring 61 in the first innings and a magnificent unbeaten 152 in the second.

In the 2010-11 season, he was the fourth-highest wicket-taker in Tier A of the Premier League tournament, taking 45 wickets in eight matches at 15.17. He has also shown that he can handle the pressure of limited-over matches: in the 2011-12 Premier Limited-Over tournament, Sri Lanka's main one-day competition, he was the highest wicket-taker with 16 in six games at 11.18. \n"", ""Senanayake's first foray into international cricket was short-lived though, and after several mediocre performances, he was released back into the domestic fold, where he continued to excel.

Initially, his glovework wasn't for the purists, but such was his batting ability that there was no question of displacing him from the XI."", 'As a batsman, he has matured steadily, and the appetite for runs was best illustrated at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo in 2006, when he and Mahela Jayawardene, captain and close friend, added 624 against a South African attack boasting Dale Steyn and Makhaya Ntini. Sangakkara contributed 287 and did his burgeoning reputation no harm a year later when he went to Hobart and scored a dazzling 192 in a close defeat. By then, he already had a half-century in a World Cup final to his name, and long before Jayawardene relinquished the captaincy, it was understood that Sangakkara would be the anointed one.', ""He has been far less relentless in the one-day arena, often throwing his wicket away when well set, but his leadership qualities have made him a sought-after signing in the Indian Premier League. With the captain's burden on his shoulders, he no longer keeps in Test matches, but the smart-alec remarks from behind the stumps are a common feature of every game that Sri Lanka plays in coloured clothes.\n \nAlthough leadership drew the best from him as a batsman, he remains a voracious no. 3 in all forms despite having relinquished the reins in 2011. Sangakkara won the top prize at 2012's ICC awards, in addition to the award for Test Cricketer of the Year and the People's Choice award for the second year running. Later that year he confirmed himself among batting's modern greats, by becoming the equal fastest man to 10,000 Test runs alongside Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara, with the biggest Test crowd Sri Lanka had ever played for in audience, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

He played for the national Under-19 team in the World Cup in 2002, when he was also a student at the CFX Academy. He bats in glasses and most of his successes have been in one-day cricket; he has yet to learn to build major innings in first-class cricket.

Despite this, he played two Tests against India in September 2005, after the withdrawal of most of Zimbabwe's top players, and did no worse than anybody else. However, coach Kevin Curran reports that he was sent back from the West Indies tour for disciplinary reasons. He went to play club cricket in England and wasn't part of the senior Zimbabwe side for three years.

Chigumbura is a product of the ZC development programme and took to the game at Chipembere Primary School in the Highfield township of Harare. A protégé of coach Stephen Mangongo, he won a ZCU scholarship to Churchill High School and represented Zimbabwe in two Under-19 World Cups.   \n"", ""He made a name for himself at this level when he took four wickets in Zimbabwe's unexpected victory over Australia at the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2004. Chigumbura was fast-tracked into the Zimbabwe national side in the absence of the 'rebel' players later that year and despite looking out of his depth on Test debut against Sri Lanka, he appeared a much-improved player by the time of the Champions Trophy five months later where he put in a good allround performance against Sri Lanka, scoring 57 and picking up 3 for 37. "", ""Chigumbura was capable of surprising pace before being forced to sit out much of 2005 after sustaining a stress fracture of the back during the South Africa tour in March of that year. He played as a specialist batsman on the West Indies tour in May 2006 due to his injury, and in the home series against Bangladesh which followed and as his bowling recovered consistent, if unspectacular, performances lead to his inclusion in the squad for the Africa XI v Asia XI games in 2007. Chigumbura acquitted himself admirably in the first match at Bangalore, dominating his 67-run partnership with Shaun Pollock with a combative 40. He also played a vital role in Zimbabwe's victory over Australia at the World Twenty20 in South Africa, removing both openers and rotating the strike well as Zimbabwe squeaked home in the final over. "", ""After a year of middling performances in 2008, Chigumbura came into his own in the home series against Kenya in 2009. He tormented the Kenyan bowlers, smashing consecutive scores of 79, 68, 43 and 36 at a strike rate well above a-run-a-ball, and picking up seven wickets for good measure.  He followed that up with a starring allround performance in the first match of the ODI series in Bangladesh, taking three cheap wickets and guiding Zimbabwe home with an unbeaten 60, but could not replicate his form in the remaining games of the series. In March 2010 Chigumbura signed up as Northamptonshire's overseas player for the County Championship and 40-over league."", ""Chigumbura took over as captain of the national side after Prosper Utseya's resignation, having already cut his teeth on the role as Mashonaland Eagles' skipper, but after some initial success - including leading Zimbabwe to the finals of a home tri-series including India and Sri Lanka - Chigumbura's own form fell away alarmingly and in June 2011 he was replaced as captain by Brendan Taylor. He was handed back the limited-overs captaincy in July 2014 as part of ZC's plan to split the leadership between him and Taylor.

Chibhabha has found more success in cricket's shorter formats, where he bats up the order and is also capable of bowling seamers at surprising pace off an apparently leisurely run-up. Coming from the townships, he was well coached under the ZC development programme and has a sound technique against pace, with the discipline to play straight and the courage to take on the short ball, but is not as comfortable against spin. He is a superb fielder, usually in the covers.\n \nHe was fast-tracked into the national side in 2005 after the departure of a slew of senior players, and after an inauspicious start (he made a duck on debut against New Zealand and struggled in the Under-19 Afro Asian Cup) he came good with back-to-back fifties in the opening matches of the tour of the Caribbean in 2006. Consistency was lacking, however, with Chibhabha struggling to convert regular starts into big scores. As such, his appearances for the national side have been marked by their irregularity.\n \nChibhabha captained the Southern Rocks franchise for some time, and was their leading scorer by some distance in the 2009-10 domestic Twenty20 competition. He carried that form into Zimbabwe's tour of South Africa later that year where he scored back-to-back fifties in the T20s, the second of which very nearly helped Zimbabwe to chase down a mammoth 194. Chibhabha moved to Mashonaland Eagles for the 2012/13 season, but the switch didn't immediately to lead to more chances with the national side. He bolted into the team's squad for the 2015 World Cup, however, with a 155 against Canada and a couple of fifties in domestic cricket in the lead-up to the tournament helping his case.\n \nHis sister Julia was the first Zimbabwe women's captain and also the first women's player to be contracted as a coach by Zimbabwe Cricket."", ' \n']",[],3.0,6,0,124.0,60,20.66,341,36.36,0,1,18,0,0.0,0.0,103.0,103,2,2389.0,99,23.65,3784,63.13,0,16,226,14,33.0,0.0,33.0,32,0,621.0,67,19.40,570,108.94,0,5,72,12,9.0,0.0,96.0,178,4,4715,127,27.09,,,6,25,,,55.0,0.0,212.0,209,9,4989,121*,24.94,,,2,33,,,72.0,0.0,83.0,81,3,1895,86*,24.29,1656,114.43,0,14,185,51,26.0,0.0,3.0,4,246,162,1.0,1/44,1/44,162.0,3.95,246.0,0,0,0,103.0,58,1667,1615,35.0,4/25,4/25,46.14,5.81,47.6,1,0,0,33.0,22,323,455,14.0,3/18,3/18,32.50,8.45,23.0,0,0,0,96.0,,6661,3800,123,5/66,,30.89,3.42,54.1,3,2,0,212.0,,3672,3177,91,4/25,4/25,34.91,5.19,40.3,1,0,0,83.0,59,922,1351,44,4/32,4/32,30.70,8.79,20.9,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

But at the other end of that action there have been wickets - and lots of them. A tall, wiry fast bowler with appreciable pace and the ability to move the ball away from the right hander, Chatara has risen quickly to prominence since his first-class debut for Mountaineers in 2009. Naturally athletic, he had represented his home province of Manicaland in 200 and 400 metre events while in high school and soon found his calling in cricket.\n \nHe finished the series against the Bangladesh Under-19s in November 2009 as the leading wicket-taker, and represented Zimbabwe Under-19 at the World Cup in 2009-10 before making his senior Zimbabwe debut in the second Twenty20 against India at Harare in June 2010. There was a significant gap in his appearances for Zimbabwe thereafter, but he matured in the A side and in domestic cricket until 2013, when it became plainly apparent that he was one of the best quicks in the country. Chatara took 32 wickets in 18 international games in 2013 and his maiden Test five-for sealed the famous Test win over Pakistan. After Kyle Jarvis' international retirement, Chris Mpofu's fall down the pecking order, and Brian Vitori's susceptibility to injury, Chatara found himself Zimbabwe's senior bowler in 2014 - a role he appeared to take to rather well."", ' \n']",[],9.0,16,2,90.0,22,6.42,185,48.64,0,0,14,1,0.0,0.0,62.0,41,17,159.0,23,6.62,327,48.62,0,0,13,2,6.0,0.0,13.0,2,0,15.0,8,7.50,17,88.23,0,0,1,0,2.0,0.0,51.0,70,17,496,46*,9.35,820,60.48,0,0,65,12,13.0,0.0,129.0,73,34,302,37*,7.74,530,56.98,0,0,19,9,19.0,0.0,47.0,9,3,22,8,3.66,33,66.66,0,0,1,0,15.0,0.0,9.0,16,1695,663,24.0,5/61,6/106,27.62,2.34,70.6,0,1,0,62.0,62,3037,2636,85.0,4/33,4/33,31.01,5.20,35.7,1,0,0,13.0,13,282,351,15.0,3/20,3/20,23.40,7.46,18.8,0,0,0,51.0,95,8896,4045,186,6/33,11/49,21.74,2.72,47.8,5,9,1,129.0,129,6262,5041,190,5/34,5/34,26.53,4.83,32.9,4,3,0,47.0,47,1015,1178,51,4/29,4/29,23.09,6.96,19.9,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshire's middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion.\n \nBut it is somewhat surprising that Ervine is playing cricket at all, as a freak accident in his early teens - he slipped and fell on a broken glass in his family's living room - required a three-hour reconstructive operation to his right hand. The injury had been so severe that amputation was considered an option in the initial diagnosis. Ervine's recovery from the injury focused his ambitions, and mid-way through his A level studies at Lomagundi College on the outskirts of Chinhoyi he won a place at the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy. Ervine soon found his way into the Midlands, and Zimbabwe Under-19 and A sides before heading to England to expand his horizons and improve his game.\n \nAfter spells with English clubs Bexhill and Lordhood, and a stint with Irish club Lisburn in Belfast, Ervine returned to Zimbabwe and took up a contract with Masvingo-based franchise Southern Rocks. Ervine was their leading run-scorer in the 2009-10 Logan Cup and topped their one-day averages as well. His returns in the domestic Twenty20 competition were more modest, but a call-up to Zimbabwe's squad for the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean followed. \n \nErvine's returns from Zimbabwe's trip to the Caribbean in early 2013 suggested a career heading in the right direction. He averaged 60.50 in the ODIs against West Indies, and was the leading run-scorer across all three formats on the tour. When Zimbabwe returned home, however, Ervine refused a paltry winter contract offer from ZC and instead left the country to play club cricket for Lisburn and Grade Cricket for Morley in Western Australia. It appeared another bright talent had been lost to Zimbabwean cricket, but after an 18-month break Ervine once again made himself available for Zimbabwe ahead of the 2014-15 season. The 2015 World Cup was surely a motivation for his move, and Ervine was included in Zimbabwe's squad for that tournament."", ' \n']",[],15.0,30,2,941.0,160,33.6,1925,48.88,2,3,113,6,15.0,0.0,84.0,81,11,2176.0,130*,31.08,2943,73.93,2,12,186,28,39.0,0.0,16.0,15,0,229.0,42,15.26,287,79.79,0,0,21,2,8.0,0.0,70.0,125,6,4813,215,40.44,,,10,25,,,63.0,0.0,159.0,150,28,4639,168*,38.02,,,8,25,,,67.0,0.0,56.0,50,9,1054,96,25.70,893,118.02,0,6,95,31,26.0,0.0,15.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,84.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,16.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,70.0,,210,143,3,2/44,,47.66,4.08,70.0,0,0,0,159.0,,158,125,1,1/25,1/25,125.00,4.74,158.0,0,0,0,56.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

Rather fittingly, in what was a highlight of his career, he went on to lead West Indies to their first world title since the 1979 World Cup with a stirring victory over hosts Sri Lanka in the 2012 World Twenty20 final.  \n', ""Sammy is in fact the first international cricketer to emerge from St Lucia, an island rediscovering its cricket culture as the new Beausejour Stadium has captured imaginations. He won a one-day cap in England in 2004 - although there wasn't actually any play in the match, it counted as the toss was made - and was called up late to the Champions Trophy squad in September 2004 after Jermaine Lawson pulled out with a stress-fractured back. In July 2006, he was named as St Lucia's captain for West Indies' first-ever Twenty20 tournament and was recalled for the tour of England in 2007. After missing the first two Tests, Sammy was drafted into the side for his debut at Old Trafford, and celebrated with 7 for 66 in the second innings - a performance that included three wickets in a single over. St Lucian fans had their first opportunity to see Sammy in an ODI in his home country when he played at Gros Islet against Sri Lanka in 2008. "", ""In the next two years, Sammy struggled to hold down a place in the Test side while remaining a fairly permanent fixture in the one-day team. Playing for a weakened team against Bangladesh in 2009, he ended the two-Test series with 12 wickets. Further success with the ball came on Zimbabwe's tour of the Caribbean in 2010, as he became the first West Indian to take five wickets in a Twenty20 international. West Indies went on to lose that game, but Sammy's bowling in the one-day series which followed - he took eight wickets at 12.50 and an economy rate of just 2.85 - was a major factor in the home side's win. He was also one of the bright spots in West Indies' whitewashing by the South Africans later that year, although this time it was his batting that grabbed the attention: he scored his runs at a strike-rate of 145.31, and registered the fastest ever half-century by a West Indian in the second ODI at North Sound, very nearly snatching an unlikely win. "", ""After Chris Gayle did not sign a central contract in 2010, Sammy was named captain of the Test and one-day teams. He did lead West Indies to their first Test win in two years, taking seven wickets against Pakistan in Providence in 2011, but overall the results were disappointing. Though West Indies won six in a row - against New Zealand (at home), Bangladesh and Zimbabwe - they then lost heavily against India and New Zealand (away). With Sammy's performances with bat and ball being less than impressive, he was replaced as Test captain by Denesh Ramdin in May 2014.""]",[],38.0,63,2,1323.0,106,21.68,1949,67.88,1,5,157,34,65.0,0.0,126.0,105,30,1871.0,89,24.94,1870,100.05,0,9,145,84,67.0,0.0,68.0,52,18,587.0,42*,17.26,398,147.48,0,0,45,31,31.0,0.0,96.0,158,9,3549,121,23.81,,,2,22,,,137.0,0.0,191.0,161,37,3092,89,24.93,,,0,14,,,104.0,0.0,294.0,247,73,3717,71*,21.36,2627,141.49,0,6,245,225,115.0,0.0,38.0,65,6215,3007,84.0,7/66,8/98,35.79,2.90,73.9,1,4,0,126.0,119,4956,3851,81.0,4/26,4/26,47.54,4.66,61.1,1,0,0,68.0,59,916,1116,44.0,5/26,5/26,25.36,7.31,20.8,1,1,0,96.0,,13744,6312,217,7/66,,29.08,2.75,63.3,6,10,0,191.0,,7654,5850,154,4/16,4/16,37.98,4.58,49.7,5,0,0,294.0,214,3381,4467,157,5/26,5/26,28.45,7.92,21.5,2,1,0,False,False,True,True

Buttler has helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, whilst also reigniting his Test career after a surprise recall by new national selector Ed Smith. \n"", 'Softly-spoken and unassuming, with supple hands and a great eye, Buttler kills opposing attacks with kindness, with a graceful flip shot for six over long-on and the occasional resort to a nerveless ramp shot over the wicketkeeper among his most eye-catching shots in an inventive repertoire. Like his captain, Eoin Morgan, his unflustered response to even the most daunting run chase is one of his greatest assets, his steely resolve hidden beneath a benign exterior. Such was his impact for Mumbai Indians in his first appearance in IPL in 2016, capable of mayhem late in the innings, that for a young cricket follower in India with only Twenty20 in their heart, it was possible to imagine that England had rarely, if ever, produced a player of such star quality. ', ""Buttler was in the crowd at Taunton as a young spectator during the 1999 World Cup when India's Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid thrashed what was then the highest partnership in ODI cricket. He was hooked. Somerset gained special permission from the ECB to add him to their Academy at 12, two years early, and he came to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somerset's title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somerset's run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somerset's defeat to Surrey."", ""He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of England's T20 side. A first ODI appearance came against Pakistan in the UAE during the winter, though he had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper. When Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Craig Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India. With Kieswetter still preferred as Somerset's gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future."", ""England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's as he led a failed run chase virtually single-handed. When Matt Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble - what proved to be a career-ending injury - the selectors gambled by throwing Buttler into the Test team. He scored five half-centuries in his first eight Tests, including 85 on debut against India at the Ageas Bowl, but his form faltered and he lost the gloves to Jonny Bairstow on England's tour of the UAE in 2015-16, during a period where his keeping started to make necessary improvements but his batting slip away."", ""There were no such doubts about his place in the white-ball teams. His seniority was recognised when he was named Morgan's vice-captain for the 2015 World Cup and, although that tournament was an unhappy one for England, Buttler was a key member of the side that reached the final of the World T20 a year later. His dynamic batting was emblematic of England's one-day reinvention under Morgan, though he also began to demonstrate increased range to his game - when he led England to an extraordinary one-wicket win over Australia at Old Trafford in 2018, his unbeaten 110 from 122 balls was by far the slowest hundred of his career."", ""Amid increasing demand on the T20 circuit, which included spells in the Bangladesh Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, Buttler's Test star seemed to be waning. He was briefly recalled in India in 2016-17 but then spent more than a year on the fringes, and was even overlooked as Bairstow's back-up during the following winter's Ashes tour. However, his stellar form for Rajashtan Royals in the 2018 IPL - he equalled the league record for consecutive fifties - prompted Smith to pick up the phone. Impressive contributions against Pakistan followed, and then, at long last, a maiden Test hundred, recorded in defeat to India at Trent Bridge. Suddenly, Buttler was integral in all three formats once again."", '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2010'],31.0,54,6,1722.0,106,35.87,2876,59.87,1,14,204,18,68.0,0.0,127.0,105,22,3387.0,150,40.8,2862,118.34,7,18,289,107,155.0,28.0,66.0,58,11,1260.0,73*,26.80,912,138.15,0,7,102,53,23.0,4.0,95.0,152,13,4593,144,33.04,7651,60.03,5,29,585,53,184.0,2.0,198.0,165,42,5553,150,45.14,4653,119.34,9,34,512,170,207.0,33.0,241.0,220,41,5397,95*,30.15,3747,144.03,0,36,451,225,127.0,27.0,31.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,66.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,95.0,1,12,11,0,-,-,-,5.50,-,0,0,0,198.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,241.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

A skiddy fast bowler, she represented Yorkshire at Under-15 and Under-17 level, but took a break from county cricket at the age of 17 because she was overweight and not really enjoying the game. \n"", ""But two years later - spurred on by her sister's dramatic weightloss - Brunt was back, leaner and meaner than ever. She moved up from Yorkshire to Super 4s to England as fast as her weight had dropped off - at lightning pace - and both transformations were down to sheer grit and application.\nSo dramatic was her weightloss after a vigorous dieting and exercise regime that some of her new England colleagues didn't recognise her when, aged 19, she turned up for the drawn Test against New Zealand in 2004."", 'A trip to South Africa for the 2005 World Cup followed, although it ended in disappointment for second-ranked England who were knocked out at the semi-final stage by the eventual winners Australia. But Brunt exacted revenge four months later, taking 14 wickets in the two Tests and scoring her first Test fifty besides as England romped to their first Ashes series win in 42 years.', ""A few months later she toured the subcontinent when England visited Sri Lanka and India at the end of 2005, with mixed success. Brunt's own tour ended early when she broke a finger and had to fly home."", 'In fact her career has been blighted by injuries throughout, in particular a troublesome back, which saw her miss the 2007-08 Ashes to recover from surgery. She reignited the injury out in Australia during the 2013-14 Ashes and seriously considered walking away from cricket altogether, but the ushering in of the professional era in May that year allowed her the time and support to fight her way back to full fitness and recover much of her old pace.', ""The recovery time has always proved worth it. A fully fit Brunt has been one of the most powerful weapons in England's armoury, since 2009 becoming England's leading strike bowler with a pace that - at her quickest - has rivalled the fastest in the women's game. Picked in the 2009 50-over World Cup squad, she took six wickets from five games, and was retained for the World T20 later that year, taking a phenomenal 3 for 6 in the final against New Zealand at Lord's as England triumphed."", ""She has particularly shone against Australia, with her 6 for 69 in the first innings of the 2009 Worcester Test helping ensure that England retained the Ashes. In the new format women's Ashes in 2013 she took nine wickets at an economy of 3.02 across all three formats. The improvement in her batting was also apparent in the 2015 Ashes series, when she top-scored with 39 for England in the first innings of the Canterbury Test. It may well be that she is in future years considered a genuine allrounder; yet whether batting or bowling, the same qualities of passion and aggression always shine through."", '\n', '\n']",['ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2014'],11.0,14,4,156.0,52,15.6,506,30.83,0,1,21,0,3.0,0.0,116.0,64,17,771.0,72*,16.4,985,78.27,0,2,68,8,33.0,0.0,67.0,36,18,302.0,42*,16.77,277,109.02,0,0,22,8,19.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,19,2082,852,39.0,6/69,9/111,21.84,2.45,53.3,1,2,0,116.0,114,5721,3321,144.0,5/18,5/18,23.06,3.48,39.7,2,5,0,67.0,67,1461,1253,66.0,3/6,3/6,18.98,5.14,22.1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,True,True

His new-ball partnership with James Anderson has sustained England's Test attack for years, his own aggression and ability to flog bounce from all but the most benign surface dovetailing nicely with Anderson's technical excellence. And as Anderson continued to set new landmarks, Broad followed ably in his slipstream, emulating his friend when becoming only the second Englishman to take 400 Test wickets. \n"", ""Broad has been blessed with one remarkable career performance. However long he plays, surely nothing will come close to the first session of the Ashes Test of 2015, on his home ground of Trent Bridge, when he took 8 for 15 as Australia were bowled out before lunch, in only 18.3 overs, for 60. This was Australia's ultimate humiliation - a beating as raw and ridiculed as the 5-0 larruping from 18 months earlier that England were on their way avenging. Broad's incredulous hands-to-mouth expression as Ben Stokes plucked a catch at fifth slip became the picture of the summer."", 'Broad has always been a bowler capable of a hot streak. On the occasion of his 100th Test in November 2016, he had taken five wickets in a single spell seven times. On such occasions, he runs in hard and his menace visibly grows. His combative fast bowling and volatile temperament (comparisons have been made with Draco Malfoy, a Harry Potter baddie) has been one of his great strengths as well as periodically bringing criticism about his behaviour, but the respect in which he is held was amplified when England recognised his desire to succeed and ability to think on his feet by appointing him as Twenty20 captain. He led the side on 27 occasions between 2011-15 before England, with an eye to the preservation of a vital player, utilised him increasingly as a Test specialist.', 'Despite being carted for six sixes in an over by Yuvraj Singh at the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007, his stock continued to rise on tour with England in Sri Lanka when his 11 cheap wickets helped them to a 3-2 one-day series victory. He was then called up for the subsequent Test series, making his debut on a slab of Colombo concrete and toiling for 36 sweaty overs. The subsequent tour of New Zealand proved to be his real chance, however. With Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison both lacking form, he was selected for the Wellington Test. The decision taken by his coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan was soon vindicated.  ', 'Broad was already shaping up as the Next Big Thing of English cricket when he pushed his career into overdrive in a sensational spell of bowling in the fifth and decisive Ashes Test at The Oval in 2009. With the series in the balance, Broad claimed figures of 5 for 37 in 12 overs, including 4 for 8 in 21 balls, and after that there was no coming back for Australia.', 'He was struck by injury for the first time in the 2010-11 winter, ruled out of the last three Ashes Tests before breaking down again during the World Cup. However, his significance in England\'s future was confirmed when he was named Twenty20 captain. A slump in form almost cost him his Test place for the visit of India - a period when he was misguidedly imagined in the ""enforcer"" role - but, having survived the cut, he responded with a Man-of-the-Series display, including the first Test match hat-trick to be recorded at Trent Bridge, in a spell of 5 for 5: another trademark burst.', ""Broad's form with the ball was one of the few positives as England suffered a 3-0 whitewash against Pakistan in February 2012 and he began the domestic Test season in splendid form, against West Indies at Lord's, taking 7 for 72 in the first innings, which made him only the eighth player to earn the distinction of being on two honours boards at the home of cricket. His four in the second innings made him the first England bowler to take 10 wickets or more in a match there since Ian Botham in 1978."", 'His subsequent form was less impressive, however. Concerns that he was dropping in pace were alleviated by eight wickets against South Africa at Headingley, but he lost his place on the tour of India, after struggling with a heel injury and failing to take a wicket in either of the first two Tests. But after being fitted with specially designed boots, he showed signs of improvement.', ""That recovery was confirmed against New Zealand at Lord's, as he ripped out 7 for 44 - his best Test figures - and he then almost single-handedly won the Durham Test against Australia with another 11-wicket haul (six in one inspired spell), as England secured their third Ashes series in a row. There was a six-for in the first innings at Brisbane, as England began the return tour in 2013-14 well enough - only to end up being whitewashed for the third time in Ashes history."", 'Broad\'s growing maturity was never more evident. He went to Australia as a marked man, after his butter-wouldn\'t-melt failure to walk at Trent Bridge the previous summer, his nick against Ashton Agar looking all the worse because the ball cannoned off the gloves of wicketkeeper Brad Haddin to first slip. Broad had to withstand a self-righteous debate about ""walking"", a practice which had largely died out for half a century, and he was roundly booed by Australian crowds throughout the winter, but he softened their hostility by good-naturedly soaking up all they threw at him, as well as producing some of England\'s best spells, and emerging as their leading wicket-taker, on a forgettable tour.', ""He was too hostile for India again at Old Trafford in 2014, returned his Ashes eight-for the following year, then treated South Africa to a concerted assault in Johannesburg in 2015-16. Broad's latest five-wicket spell was his first overseas and brought a decisive end to South Africa's proud stint as the world No.1 Test side. When he claimed his 400th Test wicket in Auckland in 2018, he was the youngest man to reach the mark."", ""His batting has flattered to deceive. In 2008, no less a technical purist than Geoffrey Boycott likened his tall elegant batting style to Sir Garfield Sobers, but predictions that he would develop into a fully-fledged allrounder did not come to pass. Nevertheless, he has a remarkable Test hundred against his name, his stand-and-deliver assault on the Pakistan attack at Lord's in 2010, from 102 for 7, bringing him 169 - the highest score by an England No. 9. The Test was later sullied by revelations that Pakistan had bowled deliberate no-balls, bringing lengthy bans for three of their players."", 'In his early cricketing career, Broad played as an opening batsman, following the example of his father, Chris, until he suddenly shot up. Within 18 months he had transformed himself into a beanpole medium-fast bowler, gaining international recognition with the England Under-19 side and establishing himself in the Leicestershire first XI in 2005, beginning a meteoric rise that included an England A debut in only his 11th first-class match in March 2006 and a call-up to the senior one-day side five months later.', ""County cricket figured little for such an England regular but when he played (and often when he wasn't) his commitment was impressive, suggesting a player who had not lost touch with his roots. He moved from Leicestershire to Nottinghamshire, his father's county, in 2008. He bowled with pace and swing to return career-best figures of 8 for 52 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in July 2010, as well as helping them to lift the 2013 YB40 trophy at Lord's - the county's first one-day silverware in 22 years."", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2005, 2006, 2007', ""Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketers of the Year 2006""]",126.0,183,24,3064.0,169,19.27,4710,65.05,1,12,377,37,42.0,0.0,121.0,68,25,529.0,45*,12.3,709,74.61,0,0,35,10,27.0,0.0,56.0,26,10,118.0,18*,7.37,118,100.0,0,0,7,3,21.0,0.0,202.0,280,40,4910,169,20.45,7713,63.65,1,24,,,73.0,0.0,151.0,80,28,620,45*,11.92,817,75.88,0,0,42,10,32.0,0.0,85.0,32,12,152,18*,7.60,149,102.01,0,0,10,3,26.0,0.0,126.0,231,25737,12698,437.0,8/15,11/121,29.05,2.96,58.8,16,16,2,121.0,121,6109,5364,178.0,5/23,5/23,30.13,5.26,34.3,9,1,0,56.0,55,1173,1491,65.0,4/24,4/24,22.93,7.62,18.0,1,0,0,202.0,,38302,19603,710,8/15,,27.60,3.07,53.9,28,27,3,151.0,,7496,6591,216,5/23,5/23,30.51,5.27,34.7,9,1,0,85.0,83,1788,2144,100,4/24,4/24,21.44,7.19,17.8,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

Strong-willed, independent and with an understated sense of humour, he perfectly captured the stereotype of the self-made Yorkshire sportsman.

Called into the side as a replacement for Steven Finn, and with a remit to keep the runs down, he starred with a performance of skill, pace and unrelenting accuracy.

He returned to the ODI team for their run to the Champions Trophy final and then picked up four wickets in England's crushing Ashes win at Lord's but his utility had been diminished and he became a victim of England's subsequent Ashes whitewash in Australia, his career limited after that to limited-overs formats."", ""Bresnan began his international career in the England Under-19 set-up and was part of the team in 2002 and 2003 - playing in two World Cups - the same years that he won the NBC Denis Compton Award for most promising Yorkshire player. All the potential took a few years to develop, but 2005 was an important year for him as he was given more responsibility in a transitional Yorkshire team. He was surprisingly overlooked for the England Academy, but started 2006 with a string of impressive performances with bat and ball, leading to a call-up to England's new-look one-day squad to face Sri Lanka. However, he fell victim to the flashing blades of Jayasuriya and co., then suffered injury in the second half of the season as he lost his place for the series against Pakistan."", ""A better all-round summer in 2008 helped him catch the selectors' eyes again, however, and he was called up late in the season for the one-day squad. But after a winter without any honours it appeared he would have to bide his time again before he was surprisingly named in the Test squad to face West Indies. He duly played in both matches, but such was England's dominance it wasn't until the final day of the series that he finally made his mark. He claimed his maiden Test wicket in the second innings and eventual figures of 3 for 45, as West Indies slumped to an innings defeat."", ""While he hovered around the fringes of the Test side thereafter injuries during England's tour to Bangladesh in 2010 opened the door and he impressed, showing good discipline and stamina in trying conditions. He then played an important role in delivering England the 2010 World Twenty20, showing skill and an unfailing ability to hit his straps early to give England control with the new ball, before returning at the end of the innings with steely death-bowling. "", ""Injuries than began to hamper him. A second operation on a troublesome right elbow caused him to miss the 2013 tour to New Zealand. He returned to England's colours adamant that his pace, which he admitted had been reduced because of the injury, had been restored, but it was hard to accept the claim as he struggled like many of his colleagues during England's 5-0 whitewash in Australia in 2013/14. He did not represent England in Tests the following summer. His zip had gone, however, later evidenced by a third elbow operation after the 2016 season. But he committed himself instead to back-to-back Yorkshire Championship wins were his down-to-earth approach, on and off the field, remained highly prized. "", ""An unbeaten hundred against Somerset was his first since 2007 and an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 366 with Jonny Bairstow against Durham at Chester-le-Street - both batsmen making career-best scores - emphasised Yorkshire's might. It was a record stand against Durham, the third-highest seventh-wicket stand in the history of first-class cricket and it is the fifth-highest for Yorkshire, the other four all being opening partnerships. But it was his redoubtable efforts in 2016 that won Yorkshire hearts as much as ever before: Yorkshire conceded the chance of a hat-trick of Championship titles on the final evening of the season, at Lord's, against the side that took their crown, Middlesex, but Bresnan's defiant, unbeaten 142 ensured they did not concede it without a fight in an innings that would enter Yorkshire folklore. "", 'His career-best figures in any format came on an extraordinary, wet night at Headingley when he returned 6 for 19 before a sold-out Roses T20 crowd. Four wickets came in his last over, three to Bresnan plus a run-out that he made off his own bowling, enough to tempt him into a knee slide across the outfield in the pouring rain. ""Knee sliding at 32,"" he said afterwards, in disbelief.', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2002, 2003', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2012']",23.0,26,4,575.0,91,26.13,1458,39.43,0,3,67,1,8.0,0.0,85.0,64,20,871.0,80,19.79,965,90.25,0,1,88,6,20.0,0.0,34.0,22,9,216.0,47*,16.61,170,127.05,0,0,16,6,10.0,0.0,194.0,264,41,6456,169*,28.95,13659,47.26,6,33,,,101.0,0.0,273.0,199,54,3104,95*,21.40,3424,90.65,0,9,,,72.0,0.0,165.0,121,49,1535,51,21.31,1165,131.75,0,1,115,56,58.0,0.0,23.0,41,4674,2357,72.0,5/48,8/141,32.73,3.02,64.9,4,1,0,85.0,84,4221,3813,109.0,5/48,5/48,34.98,5.42,38.7,3,1,0,34.0,34,663,887,24.0,3/10,3/10,36.95,8.02,27.6,0,0,0,194.0,,32356,16830,546,5/28,,30.82,3.12,59.2,24,9,0,273.0,,12074,10535,309,5/48,5/48,34.09,5.23,39.0,7,1,0,165.0,161,3182,4301,160,6/19,6/19,26.88,8.10,19.8,0,1,0,False,False,False,False

Admirers of his laid-back approach to life,  and there are many, forever lived in hope that his England career would finish in a blaze of glory, but England's inglorious World Cup campaign in 2015 - and his 120th ODI cap against Afghanistan in Sydney - was where his international story ended. \n"", 'Bopara believers from that point had to take their satisfaction in county cricket and, at Essex, he scored consistently enough across all formats to be in the top ten of run-scorers worldwide over the previous decade: a statistical challenge, along with his 100-plus appearances in all competitions, to those who regarded his career as unfulfilled.', ""In 2002, aged 17, Bopara earned a professional contract with Essex and immediately established himself as a name for the future. He made his first-team debut the same year, playing three Championship matches before being picked for the Under-19 World Cup in 2003. Three years later, his county form was rewarded with a place in England's preliminary squad for the 2006 Champions Trophy and the Academy squad to be based in Perth during the winter's Ashes series."", 'After impressing the selectors, he made his ODI debut against Australia at Sydney, and claimed the wicket of Mike Hussey to help England kick-start their trophy-winning campaign with a 92-run win. A fortnight later at the World Cup in the Caribbean, he showed impressive resolve and class in his maiden one-day fifty against Sri Lanka, albeit in a losing cause. He was one of only a handful of England players to emerge from that tournament with their reputation enhanced, but injury prevented him from building on his success at the inaugural World Twenty20.', 'Three consecutive hundreds against West Indies in early 2009 rebalanced his ledger, only for a difficult Ashes experience to again cost him his place, and he remained on the fringes of the Test side. His form in limited-overs cricket, where his medium-pace bowling is also a useful option, has been more consistent, with some of his most mature displays coming under the ODI captaincy of his Essex team-mate Alastair Cook.', ""Another encouraging display for England in their one-day series against Sri Lanka in October 2007 led to his call-up to the Test squad and he was picked to make his debut in the opening match at Kandy ahead of Owais Shah. It was, on reflection, a tour too soon for Bopara, who scratched 42 runs in three Tests, including three ducks in a row, and was axed the following January. But 14 months later, after flitting around the fringes of the ODI team, he seized his opportunity when Andrew Flintoff flew home from the Caribbean with a hip injury. Picked at No. 6 for the Barbados Test, he responded with a classy 104. Though omitted from the subsequent Test in Trinidad, to accommodate an extra bowler, he was recalled at No. 3 in the return series in England two months later and responded with hundreds in each of his next two innings, at Lord's and Chester-le-Street, to emulate the achievement of his mentor, Graham Gooch, in 1990."", ""A decent showing in the subsequent World Twenty20 confirmed Bopara's place for the Ashes series that got underway in July, but not everyone was impressed with his attitude. After mustering 105 runs in seven innings, he was dropped for the series decider at The Oval, where Jonathan Trott exceeded that tally in a single knock. Two years in the Test wilderness followed, as Eoin Morgan moved ahead of him in the selectors' thoughts, before a return as cover for the injured Trott in the third and fourth Tests against India. Bopara looked on from the sidelines in the UAE as England's batting failed disastrously against Pakistan in 2012 but first a side injury, in Sri Lanka, and then a thigh muscle tear ahead of West Indies' visit, barred him from another crack at Test cricket."", ""When it came, in the South Africa series after some impressive ODI innings against Australia, he quickly withdrew from the squad for personal reasons. He returned for World Twenty20 but still did not seem mentally attuned, as England meekly surrendered the title they won in 2010. His contribution in the 2013 Champions Trophy was more noteworthy, though he couldn't see England home in the final against India. Later that summer, he made his maiden ODI hundred in Dublin, but an Ashes trip to Australia (where he did not play a Test as England were whitewashed) suggested a player whose time might have gone. England's disastrous World Cup showing in 2015 "", 'Essex promised to bring him sustenance as those England opportunities faded.

Billings played as a specialist batsman, intended to add panache to the closing overs and to England's outfielding, abandoning the keeping gloves that had helped him to make his name.  \n"", 'He played five ODIs and two T20s without making fifty but he fitted the design of a more high-energy England side. He also featured in one of the quirkier stories of the summer when his Kent teammate Joe Denly tweeted a picture of a supposed lookalike stricken by sunburn when Billings was on England duty and ', ' swallowed the story without a second thought.', ""Billings, well heeled and well spoken, follows a long line of illustrious Kent wicketkeepers including Les Ames, 'Hopper' Levett, Godfrey Evans, Alan Knott and Geraint Jones. His passion for cricket has communicated itself to the Kent crowd in a manner that suggests he might one day stand confidently alongside such exalted company.  "", ""That reputation was enhanced in 2018 when after the potentially disruptive departure of Sam Northeast he led a rejuvenated Kent squad to their first promotion in 11 years and a Lord's final in the Royal London Cup - this despite being largely an absentee captain in early season (Joe Denly deputising) because of IPL and England commitments."", 'He is consumed by sport: an all-round games player who turned down a football trial with Tottenham Hotspur to go on a cricket tour at county level, woke up in an infirmary after being spear tackled in a rugby union game, achieved county junior level in tennis, and is highly adept at squash and racquets - his cousin Tom Billings is high in the racquet world rankings. Regular gym sessions are also part of his routine. No wonder then that he is so fleet footed around a cricket field.', ""An innings of 143 off 113 balls against Derbyshire at Canterbury - the highest one-day total by a Kent batsman at the St Lawrence Ground - was the highlight of a promising 2012 season. Billings had also scored a century, for Loughborough MCCU, on his first-class debut, against Northants in 2011. Having been the county's leading run-maker in T20 as well as CB40 in 2012, he went on an ECB scholarship to Australia over the winter of 2012-13. His burgeoning expertise behind the stumps gave an appealing extra dimension to his game."", 'As a young player at Kent in 2013, undergoing difficult second-season syndrome, Billings even enlisted the help of a company that carries out personality tests, and was persuaded that what he needed to succeed in his career was structure, order and discipline.', ""He replaced Geraint Jones, the former England gloveman, behind the stumps at the start of Kent's 2014 Championship season and emphasised his 50-over potential in the Royal London One-Day Cup, becoming the leading run-scorer in the competition, Only his T20 performances disappointed, the format in which he was soon began to make his name."", 'His growing reputation was illustrated when he called into England\'s 30-man provisional squad for the 2015 World Cup when Craig Kieswetter withdraw with eye problems. That Billings had become a player to be reckoned with was apparent from the moment he blitzed an unbeaten 135 from 58 balls against Somerset in a 50-over tie at Canterbury. Marcus Trescothick, Somerset\'s former England captain, identified Billings as a potential rival for Jos Buttler, quite an accolade considering Buttler\'s Somerset roots, and said: ""Billings absolutely annihilated us.""', ""England came a calling in 2015, with his first international 50 coming in a T20I against Pakistan in Dubai. But he remained on the fringes of the white-ball side, and responded by joining the Indian Premier League auction at the lowest base price of £35,000.

The journey was far from easy for Bairstow, especially with Jos Buttler in contention for the gloves, but prolific run-making for Yorkshire eventually made a case that England's selectors could not ignore. Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed. \n"", ""Bairstow's wicketkeeping has rarely met with universal approval and, much to his chagrin, the debate as occasional chances have been spurned about whether he might be better playing as a specialist batsman has never been silenced. But from the moment that he delivered an emotional maiden Test century in Cape Town, where his father has strong off-season links, and the aggressive batting that Yorkshire prized so highly has become a regular feature of the England scene, with only regular appearances in T20 eluding him."", ""He has had to fight against a tendency to play across the line and, to that end, he stands tall, bat held aloft, adding to his pugnacious image. Driven and independently minded, he is very much his own man. Intensive work with Bruce French, England's wicketkeeping coach, has also made his keeping more secure."", ""He was a talented all-round sportsman at an early age, even having trials with Leeds United as a right back. But it was cricket which soon dominated. An early starter with Yorkshire's Under-15s, he was named Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year in 2007, having already played for Yorkshire's Second XI and their Academy side and represented England Under-17. In October 2008, he followed in his father's footsteps by signing a full-time contract with Yorkshire.  He was eight-years-old when his father took his own life. Merely to play the game, and for the same county was courageous enough."", ""He made an impressive first-class debut against Somerset in June 2009, cracking 82 in his second innings and soon secured his place in the first XI and further honours followed when he was picked up by England's Performance Programme and included in the England Lions successful tour of the Caribbean in January 2011."", ""By now Yorkshire's first-choice keeper, he registered his maiden first-class hundred against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May of that year. Having previously passed fifty 17 times in 34 first-class matches without reaching three figures, just to emphasise his breakthrough, he made it a double. During his brilliant attacking innings, he was joined by England's recently retired opening bowler Ryan Sidebottom, in a record ninth wicket partnership for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire (which had stood since 1899) of 151. Bairstow and Sidebottom were sons of two of Yorkshire's best-loved former players, David Bairstow and Arnie Sidebottom. The passing of talent between the generations could not have been more satisfactorily captured."", 'Many suspected that, long term, Bairstow would become a specialist batsman and his debut innings in one-day internationals backed up that theory as he hit an unbeaten 41 off 21 balls against India at Cardiff before a tough tour of India showed the realities of international cricket. However, further development followed with a match-winning T20 innings against Pakistan in the UAE and after a strong start to the 2012 season he was handed a call-up to the Test squad to face West Indies.', ""It was not a happy series for Bairstow, whose problems against some hostile short bowling from Kemar Roach gained much media attention, and after a modest return of 38 runs at 12.66 he was left out of the opening Test of the South Africa series as England went with Ravi Bopara. Confirmation that he had slipped back in the selectors' thinking came when Bopara withdrew from the second Test for personal reasons and James Taylor was preferred."", ""But after Kevin Pietersen was dropped in extraordinary circumstances for the third Test at Lord's, another opportunity arose for Bairstow to which he responded magnificently. Confidence bolstered by a century for England Lions against Australia A, he led an England fightback from 54 for 4 in their first innings on day two with a brilliant 95, emerging from a peppering with short deliveries to play some fluent attacking shots in an innings former England captain Michael Vaughan said would have been the finest maiden Test century he had witnessed had his fellow Yorkshireman not been bowled by Morne Morkel."", 'His increasing international involvement restricted his appearances for Yorkshire, although he did find time to hit 182 - his second biggest first-class score - to set up a crushing win over Leicestershire at Scarborough in the Championship and a match-winning 68 not out against Sussex in the semi-finals of the FLt20.', ""Bairstow retained his place for England's winter schedule, beginning with the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. He was unable to make a significant contribution and his participation in the India Test series was also limited before he was granted leave to return home because of a family illness, missing the subsequent ODI series."", ""Thereafter his bit-part status congealed - he lost his spot in the T20 team following the New Zealand tour and, after returning to the Test team during the Ashes as England dropped Nick Compton and moved Joe Root up the order, he was abruptly left out at The Oval. He spent much of the summer running 12th man errands at a crucial stage in his development. A squad member for the return tour of Australia, he played in the last two Tests, replacing the out-of-form Matt Prior, but did not unearth the performances to promote his worth as Prior's long-term successor and had to buckle down to the county circuit the following summer."", ""That 2015 season promised to be the making of him as he struck 1108 first-class runs at 92.33, allowed by Yorkshire to play as he saw fit. Nothing was more emphatic than his 366-run alliance with Tim Bresnan at Chester-le-Street, both players making carer-bests, Yorkshire's fifth highest stand of all time. England were receptive. A combative 83 not out at Chester-le-Street after a late summons settled a weather-hit ODI against New Zealand in England's favour and the faltering form of Buttler brought a Test recall against Australia."", ""It was Cape Town, though, where Bairstow really broke through, as the summer of 2016 testified.

5 ft 11 in ",,Allrounder,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"['\nPaul Collingwood was never the most gifted cricketer to play for England, but there was so much to admire for all that. That he was a cricketer of substance was undeniable. As his county career came to an end in 2018, at the age of 42, he symbolised how much could be achieved by pluck, good sense and a deal of athleticism.  \n', 'A natural athlete with a happy-go-lucky temperament, Collingwood became the first England captain to ever deliver a global tournament when England beat Australia to win the 2010 World Twenty20. It was reward for nine years of uncomplaining professionalism, in which time he fought his way through a melee of seemingly more talented opponents to make himself indispensable in all forms of the game.', ""It took a long time to prise out Collingwood from the middle. More than seven years after the end of his England career, he retired with quite a record: he represented Durham in 23 of their 26 years in professional cricket and amassed 304 first-class appearances, 16,844 runs and 164 wickets.\nIn common with Marcus Trescothick at Somerset, he grew into one of the grand old stagers of the county circuit, communicating that England's professional circuit remained a place where international stars who had known the best could still find satisfaction. A phlegmatic, hard-working, get-the-job-done cricketer, he squeezed value from himself to the very last drop.\nHe called time on his England Test career at the end of the 2010-11 Ashes series, finishing on a high by becoming a three-times Ashes winner, and by the time he ended his ODI career two months later, he was England's leading ODI run scorer and most capped player. But his contribution was far from spent: he went on to lead Durham to the Championship in 2013 and his growing reputation as one of England's old sages was amplified when he accepted a part-time coaching role with Scotland and guided them to the World Cup finals. An opportunity working as England's fielding coach under Ashley Giles began his gradual shift in the later stages of his career from player to coach."", ""Collingwood's greatest asset was his ability to contribute to the team in several aspects. As a batsman, he stands still at the crease, plays the ball straight and has a tantalising range of strokes up his sleeve. His bowling verged towards the dibbly-dobbly, but given the right conditions he could be irresistible, as he proved with a matchwinning display of swing bowling in the third one-day game against New Zealand in 2001-02. As a fielder, he was one of the finest in the world, capable of breathtaking moments in the covers and backward point. The final tick in his column was his determination, which made him go to Melbourne in the winter of 2000-01 to play grade cricket when he realised he was treading water."", ""For the first few years in his international career he seemed destined to be a fill-in player. But at Lahore in the winter of 2005, he stuck 96 and 80 before hitting a brilliant maiden century at Nagpur with England in the middle of an injury crisis. He kicked on to become the rock of England's batting on the subsequent Ashes tour. His brilliant double-century at Adelaide ought to have been the defining moment of his career. Instead it was the preamble to one of the most devastating defeats in English Test history. But after an understandable period of introspection, Collingwood bounced back with consecutive one-day centuries to secure the CB Series. It was England's first overseas one-day trophy for nine years, and his subsequent appointment to the captaincy in June 2007 was met with unanimous approval. He cemented the role with memorable victories over India at home and Sri Lanka away."", ""A slump in form in 2008 led to his omission from the Test team and his resignation as ODI captain, but he took back the reins for the World Twenty20 in 2009, a decision that didn't look too prudent when England were embarrassed by the Netherlands in the opening match of the tournament. But less than a year later England had developed into a ruthless power-packed Twenty20 side. Led by Collingwood, their blend of fearless hitting with dynamite fielding and thoughtful bowling brushed aside all challenges as England won the tournament. They got there in style - beating Australia in the final - with Collingwood finishing the job with the winning runs."", ""A difficult summer followed, where Collingwood struggled to come to terms with the seam and swing of Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif. His batting form failed to improve during England's historic Ashes success the winter after but his fielding remained exemplary - setting the benchmark for England's high standards. In the final Ashes Test in Sydney he dismissed Michael Hussey in the first innings, sparking wild celebrations. And with England on the verge of a 3-1 triumph, he chose to retire from Test cricket, calling time on a successful Test career which many thought would never happen. He had hoped to keep playing limited-overs cricket for England but a poor World Cup followed the Ashes and he was subsequently dropped from both England's teams and replaced as Twenty20 captain by Stuart Broad."", 'After considering retirement from all cricket, he decided to continue with Durham and succeeded Phil Mustard as captain in 2012, winning an impressive seven of his first 10 matches at the helm as steering Durham from bottom of the table to safety. A Championship title duly followed in 2013 as he reinvigorated Durham in a manner few seriously expected. When some bad investments made life harder in 2014 he still led Durham to the Royal London One-Day Cup and picked up the Player of the Year award for good measure. He had become a wonderful ambassador for county cricket, but Durham were stricken by financial problems and when the ECB was forced to bail them out, as a last resort, at the end of 2016 they did so with stringent penalties - relegation from Division One of the Championship included - intended to give a warning message to others. Collingwood termed it ""a kick in the nuts"", but Durham could also learn from his ability to squeeze maximum benefit from the toughest situations.', ""That relegation brought a rush of departures, but while Collingwood was still standing there was still hope. He made 1,000 Championship runs in 2017 and became the oldest player to make a T20 hundred and Durham's first century-maker in that format, against Worcestershire at New Road.  Aged 41 years & 65 days, Collingwood beat ex-Worcestershire player Graeme Hick (41y 37d) who struck 110 against Northamptonshire in 2007. A rush of Durham awards followed. A season later, with the county showing signs of recovery, he felt able to call time."", '\n']",['Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005'],68.0,115,10,4259.0,206,40.56,9170,46.44,10,20,470,24,96.0,0.0,197.0,181,37,5092.0,120*,35.36,6614,76.98,5,26,365,74,108.0,0.0,36.0,33,2,583.0,79,18.80,459,127.01,0,3,37,24,15.0,0.0,306.0,527,52,16938,206,35.65,,,35,85,,,352.0,0.0,428.0,401,73,11240,132,34.26,,,10,65,,,207.0,0.0,148.0,131,16,2478,108*,21.54,2040,121.47,1,9,167,86,49.0,0.0,68.0,59,1905,1018,17.0,3/23,3/35,59.88,3.20,112.0,0,0,0,197.0,151,5186,4294,111.0,6/31,6/31,38.68,4.96,46.7,3,1,0,36.0,20,234,347,16.0,4/22,4/22,21.68,8.89,14.6,1,0,0,306.0,,12706,6396,166,5/52,,38.53,3.02,76.5,,2,0,428.0,,11482,9228,273,6/31,6/31,33.80,4.82,42.0,5,1,0,148.0,108,1852,2245,99,5/6,5/6,22.67,7.27,18.7,4,2,0,False,True,False,True

6 ft 2 in ",,Bowler,Right-hand bat,Right-arm fast-medium,,,,"[""\nJade Dernbach is a very modern cricketer. Earrings in both ears, tattoos covering each arm and words to accompany each delivery. His bowling is a merry-go-round of variations with slower-balls, quicker slower-balls, yorkers and bouncers as well as, crucially, an ability to touch 90mph. His variety, alongside a deep well of confidence that helps him hold his nerve, often at the most demanding times, made him a regular part of England's limited-overs teams for three years, although his penchant for over-exuberant celebrations - he has been known to run the length of the ground after getting wickets in dead first-class matches - have been widely mocked.  \n"", ""That mocking was a cross he had to bear - an extravagant appearance meant he did not blend into the background easily - but when his England career stalled - he was last seen at World Twenty20 in Chittagong in 2014 when he ran into AB de Villiers, a man on a mission - he contributed to Surrey's re-emergence as one of England's strongest counties with great passion and was a ready source of encouragement and advice for the next generation. He has been a more thoughtful cricketer than many have imagined."", ""His accent reflected a journeyed background. Born in South Africa but a graduate of the Surrey Academy, Dernbach became Surrey's youngest debutant for 30 years when - at the age of 17 - he played against India A in 2003. In 2005 he was thrust into the spotlight when selected to play against Lancashire in the semi-final of the Twenty20 Cup, although with figures of 0 for 52, he was clearly under-prepared. His first-team chances were limited thereafter, although he showed some potential in the 2nd XI."", ""A spell in Australia, playing grade cricket in Sydney for Randwick/Petersham, helped to improve his all-round game and his first hint of international recognition came in 2009 when he was called up to the ECB Fast Bowling Programme in Florida and Chennai. He was part of the Performance squad during the Ashes winter in 2010-11, and was playing in the Caribbean for England Lions when he heard of his call-up to the World Cup squad, as a replacement for Ajmal Shahzad. Though he didn't play in England's disappointing campaign he made his T20 and ODI debuts the following summer and established himself as an important part of the side."", 'However, even after than 50 international appearances, he was still fighting for full acceptance. Impressive performances have been grossly outweighed, in terms of publicity, by his mishaps. He had the ignominy of possessing some of the worst economy rates of all time in ODIs and T20 internationals and a desperate showing at the World T20 looked to have halted his England career in its tracks. By the end of 2014, he was not even an automatic selection for Surrey in Championship cricket, and was embarrassed to concede 56 in four overs of the T20 Blast semi-final. He reportedly considered leaving Surrey after his initial contractual demands were rejected, but ultimately opted to remain at the club. ', ""He not only stayed, he gained deepening respect. In 2015, he became only the third man to take a hat-trick in a Lord's final, although his 6 for 35 against Gloucestershire came in defeat, and had to endure three successive defeats in all as Surrey became perennial bridesmaids in the Lord's showcase final. Statistics insisted that in county cricket he deserved to be recognised as one of the finest List A performers of his time."", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2004, 2009']",0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,24.0,8,1,19.0,5,2.71,39,48.71,0,0,1,0,5.0,0.0,34.0,7,2,24.0,12,4.80,21,114.28,0,0,3,0,8.0,0.0,113.0,139,47,871,56*,9.46,,,0,1,,,17.0,0.0,144.0,51,19,242,31,7.56,293,82.59,0,0,,,31,0,145.0,33,15,143,24*,7.94,131,109.16,0,0,15,3,34.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,24.0,24,1234,1308,31.0,4/45,4/45,42.19,6.35,39.8,1,0,0,34.0,33,702,1020,39.0,4/22,4/22,26.15,8.71,18.0,1,0,0,113.0,,18222,10139,311,6/47,,32.60,3.33,58.5,11,10,0,144.0,,6283,6181,228,6/35,6/35,27.10,5.90,27.5,10,3,0,145.0,142,2935,4149,158,4/22,4/22,26.25,8.48,18.5,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

In 1998-99 she scored her maiden Test hundred against India but, while still scoring runs, she did not score as many runs as had been expected. In 2000, she was sidelined by a serious cruciate ligament injury sustained while playing hockey which caused her to miss almost all of the 2001 season.

Pinging the ball down from the clouds he has the heady blend of pace and trampolining bounce to rattle the best players.  At his best, his potential looks immense, but he is a gentle character given to periods of technical self-doubt and his career has often been fraught with uncertainty. \n"", 'Finn\'s career went into reverse in 2013/14. Issues with his delivery stride - a habit of kneeing the stumps led to a Law change making it a no-ball - and control meant he has been in and out of the side. Endless tinkering with his action then left him visibly bereft of confidence. He was the only member of England\'s vanquished Ashes Test squad not to play in the 5-0 whitewash and cut a forlorn figure on the practice grounds as his action was stripped right back to basics. It all led to him being sent home from England\'s tour of Australia after being deemed ""not selectable"" - an honest and sympathetic assessment - by his one-day coach Ashley Giles.', ""What followed was a long period of rehabilitation and many long hours in winter nets at Finchley CC. In 2014, his 48 first-class wickets showed progress, even if his pace and consistency were inconsistent, but the input of a host of coaches slowly brought dividends and led to his return in England's victorious Ashes series after a two-year absence in which he had been limited only to limited-overs appearances for his country. The unveiling of a new outswinger and the particular joy of a six-wicket haul at Edgbaston gave him the confidence to pronounce that the past was behind him."", ""Finn made his county debut for Middlesex as a 16-year-old in 2005, the youngest to do so since Fred Titmus in 1949, and was earmarked as an England prospect from his early days, representing England at all age-group levels from Under-16s upwards. He enjoyed a solid 2009 season for Middlesex, taking 53 wickets at 30.64 in the Championship, and then did well for England Lions in the UAE. With Stuart Broad, Graham Onions and Ryan Sidebottom all picking up injuries early on England's tour to Bangladesh, Finn was parachuted in as cover. Barely 24 hours after arriving in the country he was playing in the warm-up game against Bangladesh A and impressed on his Test debut three days later, displaying good pace and bounce on a docile Chittagong surface."", ""With the England management desperately searching for a consistent replacement for Steve Harmison, Finn marked his home debut, also against Bangladesh, in style. In the familiar surroundings of Lord's, he carried a rusty England attack with 4 for 100 in the first innings and went one better in the second, taking 5 for 87 to finish with nine in the game and the man-of-the-match medal in just his third Test."", ""He kept his place against Pakistan and despite doubts as to whether he was ready for the challenge of a tour of Australia, Finn fronted up impressively in his early outings. He claimed a career-best 6 for 125 to help turn the tide in the first Test at the Gabba, before stepping into the breach left by an injury to Stuart Broad to help seal victory in the second Test at Adelaide. Though he faded at Perth and was omitted from the last two matches, he'd done enough to confirm his promise."", 'A single Test appearance in 2011 followed, during which he became the youngest Englishman to 50 wickets, but Tim Bresnan and Chris Tremlett moved ahead of him in third-seamer pecking order. An impressive tour of India pushed him firmly into one-day contention, however, and he was a virtual ever-present in limited-overs cricket in 2012, as England briefly topped the ODI rankings but failed in their World Twenty20 defence.', ""Finn won a Test recall against South Africa but a habit of hitting the stumps in his delivery stride became costly when Graeme Smith drew attention to it at Headingley. The umpires decided to call dead ball and Finn was denied Smith's wicket. A few months later, 'Finn's Law' was created, making any wicket taken after a bowler had knocked over the stumps a no ball. "", ""Injury curtailed Finn's involvement in the historic Test series win in India but he was back in the XI in New Zealand, beginning his longest run in the side since his debut. A shortened run-up was experimented with before being abandoned but his rhythm had been affected and, having played just once in England's Champions Trophy campaign, he was dropped after the first Test of the 2013 Ashes. After his tumultuous winter in 2013/14, he rebuilt his confidence with the aid of Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson and was rewarded with an ODI recall against India in August 2014. For all the problems, further success in the 2015 Ashes series left England still convinced that Finn was a bowler of rare potential."", ""A stress fracture of the foot ruled him out of a series against Pakistan in the UAE but his recovery on a Lions tour of the Emirates was swift and he was called into England's South Africa squad ahead of the first Test."", ""If the collapse of his action in Australia in 2013/14 was a low point, he was successful enough to proclaim in England's 2015 Ashes victory that his problems were behind him, encouraged by a Test-best 6 for 79 at Edgbaston. He acquitted himself ably enough, too during England's series win in South Africa, only for his career to take another twist when he lost his limited-overs place just as he returned to Test cricket."", 'Another Australia tour beckoned. Finn, who had been out of the Test side for a year,did not make the original party, but he was called up in place of Ben Stokes after Stokes became embroiled in a police investigation after a fracas outside a Bristol night club. Four years after his horrendous Ashes experience, Finn had a chance to make amends only to be rulked out of the tour with a torn left knee cartilage.\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2009', 'ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2010', ""Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketers of the Year 2010""]",36.0,47,22,279.0,56,11.16,901,30.96,0,1,36,0,8.0,0.0,69.0,30,13,136.0,35,8.0,223,60.98,0,0,11,3,15.0,0.0,21.0,3,3,14.0,8*,-,19,73.68,0,0,1,0,6.0,0.0,149.0,182,59,1111,56,9.03,2913,38.13,0,1,150,5,47,0,142.0,57,23,368,42*,10.82,569,64.67,0,0,33,8,31,0,88.0,17,12,55,8*,11.00,65,84.61,0,0,5,0,21,0,36.0,66,6412,3800,125.0,6/79,9/187,30.4,3.55,51.2,6,5,0,69.0,67,3550,2996,102.0,5/33,5/33,29.37,5.06,34.8,4,2,0,21.0,21,480,583,27.0,3/16,3/16,21.59,7.28,17.7,0,0,0,149.0,,26646,15381,531,9/37,,28.96,3.46,50.1,29,13,1,142.0,138,6737,5762,200,5/33,5/33,28.81,5.13,33.6,7,3,0,88.0,86,1826,2323,104,4/24,4/24,22.33,7.63,17.5,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

If English cricket was still not debating the enforced removal of Kevin Pietersen from international cricket, it was arguing over the conservative approach towards one-day batting at the top of the order. Hales, a tall batsman with a destructive range of offside drives and cuts, was one of a brazen new breed of England batsmen who changed the conversation into something much more positive. \n', 'It took 32 international Twenty20 appearances - strikingly good figures, too, with an average of 38 and a strike rate approaching 140 - before Hales finally won ODI recognition from England selectors who mistrusted his technique against the short ball and his ability to build an innings. ', ""There followed a comparable wait before England considered a further transition - from ODI batsman to Test opener. His 24 ODIs had brought modest success - his average in the mid-20s - but a timely maiden ODI hundred against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi helped to propel him into England's Test squad for their 2015/16 tour of South Africa as he became the eighth opener to try to fill the gap left by Andrew Strauss' Test retirement more than three years earlier. England had exhibited a wish to play a more expansive game at Test level and that worked in his favour."", ""Eleven Tests from the Boxing Day meeting with South Africa in Durban in 2015 until The Oval brought down the curtain on the 2016 English summer against Pakistan represented a decent run in which to establish himself, but he did not take easily to the tempo and technique at Test level. In three successive Tests against Sri Lanka - at Headingley, Chester-le-Street and Lord's - he passed 80 without securing the maiden Test century he craved and which might have been a harbinger for better things. When he chose, along with his limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan, not to tour Bangladesh for safety reasons (the tour passed off uneventfully amid high security) he also found himself omitted from the subsequent India tour because of his doubts about his capacity against spin bowling. "", ""In one-day cricket, though, his prowess was evident. When he lashed 171 during the third ODI against Pakistan on his home soil at Trent Bridge in 2016, he broke the England record previously held by Robin Smith for 23 years. Hales' innings also helped England achieve the highest ever team ODI score in the same game - 444-3, bettering the previous record of 443 by Sri Lanka back in 2006."", 'Off the field, he was present with Ben Stokes when Stokes was charged of affray (for which he was found not guilty) outside a Bristol night club in September 2017; Hales was not charged.', 'Early in February 2018, Hales committed himself solely to limited-overs cricket by signing a white-ball only contract with Nottinghamshire and playing IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad. He had averaged 27.28 in his 11 Tests, and prospects of further opportunities were minimal, although he did signal his intention to reconsider his future after the 2019 World Cup. His ODI form remained occasionally devastating and he struck 147 during that rarest of things - a whitewash in a one-day series against Australia', 'At 6 foot 5, Hales has always hit with a stately intent. His England T20 debut came in 2011, to which he responded after a debut duck against India by scoring an unbeaten 62 off 48 balls as England beat West Indies at the Oval. In his first Twenty20 international of 2012, against West Indies again, he failed by one run to become the first batsman to score a century for England in the short format on his home ground of Trent Bridge, in June. He promised much in a largely ill-starred England campaign in the 2012 World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, although his innings tended to run out of steam. That first hundred by an England batsman finally came in the 2013 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh when he made an unbeaten 116 from 64 balls against Sri Lanka in Chittagong, striking a six over midwicket to secure a last-over victory. ', 'His reputation in T20 cricket grew and he earned a late deal with Melbourne Renegades for two matches of the 2012/13 Big Bash. His debut brought a brutal 89 in just 52 balls at the SCG.', 'In four-day cricket he initially progressed well, earning his county cap after scoring 184 against Somerset at Trent Bridge on his way to topping 1,000 first-class runs in the season for the first time, despite missing almost seven weeks of the campaign with a broken jaw. He added 857 first-class runs in 2012, including two centuries in August.', 'But there followed a disastrous 2013 Championship season in which Hales virtually lost interest and averaged 13.94, being advised by England as a result that he was in danger of becoming a two-dimensional Twenty20 specialist. He decided to work harder on his four-day cricket - although only after he was overlooked in the IPL 2014 draft. English players were often passed over, with their availability so uncertain, but this omission was more curious than many: his reputation had not spread outside England.

Having made an immediate impression at Sussex, Jordan was picked for England in late 2013 and seemed at home at international level during a run in the limited-overs sides over the winter, leading to his elevation to five-day cricket with a Test debut against Sri Lanka at Lord's at the start of England's 2014 summer.  \n"", 'Four cheap wickets to round up India for 94 in an innings win at The Oval brought a contented finish to an inconsistent summer where he showed glimpses of great potential, an attacking bowling style backed up by some belligerent bursts with the bat down the order and slick fielding. That display, plus an excellent all-round performance on his home ground in Bridgetown against West Indies in a Twenty20 international and his five-wicket demolition of Sri Lanka in an ODI at Old Trafford were other highlights. Yet at times things went awry as his method seemed to desert him, such as in a malfunctioning ODI spell against India in Cardiff. ', ""England's own malfunction at the 2015 World Cup led to a rethink, but Jordan survived the cull, his prowess as a death bowler still held in high regard. In and out of the side, there were few signs, though, of him running through a side with confidence."", ""Jordan, a right-arm quick bowler born in the home of fast bowling, Barbados, was first spotted in his native land by Bill Athey, who was scouting for a recipient of a cricket scholarship back in England at Dulwich College. He became an exciting prospect at Surrey but failed to emerge as the bowler the county had hoped, not helped by a troubled period in the county's affairs."", ""Jordan was earmarked for great things after Nadeem Shahid, Surrey's Second XI coach, saw five minutes of his all-round ability. Shahid immediately called then first XI coach Alan Butcher to tell him they had a gem on their books. Five days later Jordan was at first team nets. He impressed there and blazed into Surrey's team in August 2007, looking the part immediately at just 18 years old. "", 'It was a hugely promising start with 20 wickets at 24.50 before the year was out but in the following seasons, injuries and inconsistency stalled his career and he missed the whole of 2010 with a back problem. His return in 2011 produced only 11 wickets at 48.00 in the Championship but that winter returned to play for Barbados and his potential was again evident. But back with Surrey in 2012 his impact was minimal and he was released at the end of the season. He went back to Barbados, with the question looming of who he might play for internationally, and excelled again. ', 'A move to Sussex in 2013 saw his true potential come to the fore. England soon took notice. Eligible for England through his grandmother, he was selected for two England Lions fixtures in 2013 - meaning he would have to undertake a qualifying period to play for West Indies - and travelled with the full England ODI squad to Dublin. An ODI debut against Australia at the Ageas Bowl was enough to get him to Australia for the limited-overs phase of a return tour a few months later and he was one of the few players to emerge with his reputation enhanced.', '\nHe took 6 for 48 on Sussex debut against Yorkshire, his first-class best figures, and was among the leading wicket-takers in the County Championship, passing fifty wickets for the first time.

Rather than slipping out of the game, he rediscovered his pace and ambition in one of English cricket's story-book recoveries. England, pummelled by the Australian Mitchell Johnson, and eager to find an out-and-out quick bowler of their own, liked what they saw during a Lions recall, and he played the four Tests of the 2014 summer as a shock trooper - two each against Sri Lanka and India - before succumbing to injury.  \n"", ""Plunkett's return was not entirely untroubled; at times his control deserted him and his around-the-wicket approach did not always drum up the anticipated menace. But he stayed true to the exhortations of Yorkshire's coach, Jason Gillespie, to keep it simple and just bowl fast and he took 18 wickets in four Tests, with his match figures of nine for 176 against Sri Lanka on his adopted home ground of Headingley the highlight, a feat overshadowed by Sri Lanka's last-over win. Sternly bearded, with an upright style and strikingly gym-honed upper body, he regularly exceeded speeds of 90mph, but England seemed to conclude that subtlety and control was missing and thereafter chose to utilise him exclusively in white-ball cricket."", ""Plunkett's initial selection for England's tour of Pakistan and India in 2005-06 represented the culmination of a two-year rise to prominence.  A bustling fast-medium seamer blessed with an ability to bowl an occasional unplayable ball and a powerful striker down the order, he briefly promised to have a lengthy international career only for issues with his control - and, in his final season at Durham in 2012, a loss of confidence in his action - to lower his sights."", 'Having made his first-class debut for Durham in 2003, Plunkett took on immediate responsibilities in the absence of Steve Harmison and the injured Mark Davies, and in 2005 took 50 wickets in a season for the first time. He made his Test debut in a thumping England defeat against Pakistan in Lahore, following the withdrawal of Simon Jones with an ankle injury, and announced himself as a capable allrounder with a composed half-century in only his second ODI against the same opposition. ', ""He was selected for England's Ashes campaign in Australia in 2006-7 and for seven gruelling weeks he was the forgotten man of a dismal Test tour. But as England, against all predictions, regrouped to win the one-day series, he seized his opportunity to impress with 12 wickets in the one-day series, including 3 for 43 in the decisive second final against Australia. It was a performance that secured his World Cup passage, though he only played three games and lacked the incisiveness he had shown in Australia."", ""A lack of England engagements freed Plunkett up for his Durham duties, and in 2007 he played a role in their first domestic trophy triumph, in their sixteenth year of first-class status, taking three wickets as Durham won the rain-interrupted Friends Provident final by 125 runs at Lord's. A regular in England Lions squads, Plunkett spent a winter as the Dolphins' overseas player in South Africa in 2007-08 and shared in Durham's Championship success the following summer. Durham retained the title in 2009 and Plunkett was at the forefront of their success with 49 wickets in the season, including match figures of 9 for 149 in the innings win over Nottinghamshire that sealed the title."", ""Plunkett looked set for a second crack at international cricket when he was named in England's squad for their Test series against South Africa in 2009-10, but he was overtaken by the likes of Graham Onions, his Durham team mate, Stuart Broad and Ajmal Shahzad in the fast-bowling ranks and has had to be content with sporadic appearances since. "", 'Subsequently, a combination of injuries and problems with his action saw Plunkett slip down the pecking order at Durham and after two lean seasons, amounting to three Championship appearances, he was told he could look for a new county. Yorkshire took the opportunity to offer him a three-year contract, enabling him to team up again with his former Durham coach, Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket at Headingley, who like Gillespie proved a positive influence. He immediately showed signs of a resurgence, taking 36 wickets in 12 Championship matches. Yorkshire capped him. As he was born in Middlesbrough - part of the old county boundaries  - they felt they had been entitled to him all along. \n', '\n']",[],13.0,20,5,238.0,55*,15.86,509,46.75,0,1,31,0,3.0,0.0,78.0,45,15,584.0,56,19.46,588,99.31,0,1,46,17,25.0,0.0,22.0,11,4,42.0,18,6.00,34,123.52,0,0,3,1,7.0,0.0,155.0,213,39,4376,126,25.14,,,3,22,,,86,0,200.0,124,45,1586,72,20.07,1575,100.69,0,3,,,61,0,146.0,87,34,777,41,14.66,592,131.25,0,0,55,25,39,0,13.0,25,2659,1536,41.0,5/64,9/176,37.46,3.46,64.8,1,1,0,78.0,76,3627,3557,116.0,5/52,5/52,30.66,5.88,31.2,5,1,0,22.0,22,476,627,25.0,3/21,3/21,25.08,7.9,19.0,0,0,0,155.0,,23711,14273,452,6/33,,31.57,3.61,52.4,19,11,1,200.0,,8574,7912,257,5/52,5/52,30.78,5.53,33.3,10,1,0,146.0,140,2782,3723,136,5/31,5/31,27.37,8.02,20.4,1,1,0,False,False,False,False

When he was unceremoniously dumped from England's set up early in 2014, with lawyers at the ready on all sides, he was presented by those in authority as an egotistical individualist whose reluctance to respect those in charge forever undermined attempts to build a strong team ethic. Whatever view you held, Pietersen deserved to be recognised as one of the most captivating cricketers to pull on an England shirt. His flamboyant strokeplay was at the heart of many of England's finest performances for a decade. A brazen belief in his own ability, moments of outrageous unorthodoxy and, at times, a surprising vulnerability on and off the field have all combined to give him great box-office appeal.  \n"", ""His 8,181 Test runs at 47.28 in 104 Tests had few rivals in England's history and his record in limited-overs cricket was also outstanding. In 2013, he became the highest England run-scorer in all international forms of the game combined. But Pietersen's ability to command attention on the field has been matched only by his ability to divide opinion off it. After more than nine years and many controversies, Pietersen's England career was at an end, a fact he wrestled with interminably: accepting it one day, holding out hope of a miraculous return the next. He had no choice but to commit himself to the life of a T20 specialist."", 'For many England cricket fans, no name sparks more excitement. But his celebrity status, individualistic streak and outspoken ways often grated with the England cricket authorities who prefer their star names to be more malleable and conservative. The English media, which has at times been vitriolic - not to say personal - about his rebellious streak has generally recognised that he has few peers.', 'An attempt to introduce him into the inner sanctum, by appointing him England captain in August 2008, lasted only five months as his relationship with the coach, Peter Moores, was uncomfortable from the outset. Their differences simmered throughout a troubled tour of India and when the rift became public Pietersen was forced to resign early in the New Year with a disenchanted Moores sacked on the same day. ', ""Another dispute arose in May 2012 when Pietersen, agitating for the freedom to play for longer in the Indian Premier League - where his popularity was unquestioned - briefly announced his retirement from all forms of limited-overs international cricket. Pietersen's frustration had a disruptive effect on England's summer Test series against South Africa. The ECB regarded the matter as an unacceptable display of player power. He was dropped for the final Test at The Oval and omitted from World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, England predictable struggling in his absence."", ""Pietersen was born in Pietermaritzburg to an Afrikaner father, Jannie, and an English mother, Penny, and abandoned South Africa cricket as a teenager in protest against the racial quota system which he felt was unfairly restricting his opportunities at KwaZulu Natal. He joined Nottinghamshire in 2000, attracted by the chance to work with Clive Rice, the county's coach and a former South Africa allrounder, but left at the end of the 2003 season after Nottinghamshire were relegated, unhappy with the standard of the Trent Bridge pitches and expressed his feelings strongly enough for the captain, Jason Gallian, to fling his kit out of the dressing room window. He signed for Hampshire, where he remained until 2010, at which point he decamped to Surrey to be close to his Chelsea home, but by then his county appearances had long become sporadic."", 'His England career began in a low-key one-day series in Zimbabwe in 2004 when Andrew Flintoff was ""rested"" after expressing moral misgivings about the political regime of Robert Mugabe. Pietersen averaged 104 in England\'s 4-0 victory. A subsequent tour of South Africa was more daunting, but he produced three audacious centuries in the series, his unbeaten 100 in 69 balls becoming England\'s quickest ODI hundred. He went on to reach 1000 one-day runs in just 21 innings - equalling Viv Richards\' record. ', ""Test cricket beckoned with the 2005 Ashes the following summer: Pietersen's selection ahead of Graham Thorpe representing the toughest selectorial decision of early summer. He sealed the return of the urn after 17 years with a stroke-filled 158 at The Oval on the final day of the series. England needed to avoid defeat to regain the Ashes and Pietersen was dropped three times on the way to 60, but tension gave way to scenes of jubilation as his adrenalin-charged climax included seven sixes, breaking Ian Botham's record for England in an Ashes Test. He was named man of the match, finished an uneven series as top scorer, with 473 runs at 52.55 and, like the rest of the side, was awarded an MBE amid an atmosphere of national jubilation. He was also named as one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year."", ""The subsequent years were a whirl of exciting innings, occasional rash dismissals and celebrity engagements. Sri Lanka's visit to England in 2006 was a high point. He matched his highest Test score of 158 in the first Test and in the following Test at Edgbaston, to general incredulity he unveiled the Switch Hit as he reversed his stance to slog-sweep Muttiah Muralitharan for six. There was no more appropriate way for a player of Pietersen's razzamatazz to become the first batsman since Graham Gooch in 1990 to score a century in three successive Test innings in England. The MCC ruled in 2008 that the shot was legal. He was up for the challenge, too, in Australia in 2006-7, averaging more than 50, and in the World Cup which followed, but England were a ramshackle lot as Flintoff, the captain, and coach Duncan Fletcher rarely had a meeting of minds. "", ""Soon it was time for his ill-fated tilt at the England captaincy. His tenure officially began when Michael Vaughan, the Test captain, retired and Paul Collingwood stood down as ODI captain at the same time. Pietersen started with a century and victory against South Africa at The Oval but that was perhaps as close as he ever got to acceptance from the establishment. England's ODI series against India ended prematurely because of terrorist attacks on Mumbai, but England returned to fulfil the Test tour amid unprecedented security as Pietersen expressed the need not to be cowed by terrorism. But behind the scenes Pietersen's relationship was deteriorating with Moores, a coach with no international experience and an unrelenting work ethic. Pietersen recommended, rather too publicly, that Moores be removed and got his way, only to be summarily sacked as well. His relationship with the ECB never entirely recovered. Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower, who took over as captain and coach, had much healing to undertake."", ""Alongside brushes with management - a feature in all the teams he has played for - injuries have interrupted him at key moments. His 2009 Ashes campaign was cut short by leg trouble that needed surgery and he left the 2011 World Cup with a hernia. His form became mercurial rather than reliable and he seemed to develop a curious fallibility against a succession of left-arm spinners, some more renowned than others. But he ended a 20-month wait for an international century by making a career-best 227 as England won the Ashes in Australia for the first time in 24 years, then scored 533 runs at 106.60 in England's 4-0 home whitewashing of India that secured them the No.1 ranking in Tests. His reputation as one of England's greats could no longer be denied."", ""He was also the Man of the Tournament in England's World Twenty20 win in 2010 but his one-day batting tailed off, with no centuries over a three-year period between 2009 and 2011. He scored two in successive innings against Pakistan in 2012 - including his highest ODI score of 130 - and, briefly, it appeared they would be his last innings in coloured kit for England when he announced his retirement from limited-overs internationals, briefly seduced by the attractions of IPL. "", 'England\'s Test against South Africa at Headingley in 2012 captured his career in microcosm. His power struggle with the ECB had left him moody and unpredictable before the Test, but when the match began he struck a quite brilliant 149 and, in the process, became the fastest man in terms of time, to reach 7,000 Test runs. That was quickly followed by more off-field drama, as reports of derogatory text messages about his captain, Strauss, to South Africa players, filled the media. Pietersen was dropped for the next Test at Lord\'s and, even though he did an about turn and reconfirmed his desire to play for England in all formats, forgiveness did not come quickly enough for him to play in World Twenty20. When he was officially invited back into the ranks, in Colombo, he had to sit next to the ECB chairman, Giles Clarke, as details of his ""reintegration process"" were sternly issued.  His response was to bat as well as ever. His 186 in Mumbai was a jewel in England\'s crown as they won a Test series in India for the first time in 28 years.', 'The detente was short-lived, however, as cracks reappeared on England\'s disastrous 2013-14 tour of Australia where, despite being the leading run-scorer - a modest achievement in the circumstances - rumours surfaced of a further deterioration in his relationship with Flower. Although Flower himself resigned, the ECB decided to cut its losses a few days later and summarily brought down the curtain on Pietersen\'s England career as well, citing a need to rebuilt ""team ethic and philosophy"". An autobiography published later that year was arguably the most outspoken in cricket history as he launched an emotional attack on those he felt had wronged him. It was a desperately sad end.\n', '\n']","['ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2005', 'ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2006']",104.0,181,8,8181.0,227,47.28,13255,61.72,23,35,985,81,62.0,0.0,136.0,125,16,4440.0,130,40.73,5128,86.58,9,25,427,77,40.0,0.0,37.0,36,5,1176.0,79,37.93,831,141.51,0,7,119,32,14.0,0.0,217.0,358,26,16522,355*,49.76,,,50,71,,,152,0,253.0,233,34,8112,147,40.76,,,15,46,,,85,0,200.0,193,25,5695,115*,33.89,4160,136.89,3,35,495,220,66,0,104.0,58,1311,886,10.0,3/52,4/78,88.6,4.05,131.1,0,0,0,136.0,23,400,370,7.0,2/22,2/22,52.85,5.55,57.1,0,0,0,37.0,3,30,53,1.0,1/27,1/27,53.00,10.6,30.0,0,0,0,217.0,,6443,3760,73,4/31,,51.50,3.50,88.2,,0,0,253.0,,2390,2122,41,3/14,3/14,51.75,5.32,58.2,0,0,0,200.0,30,396,534,17,3/33,3/33,31.41,8.09,23.2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He had several opportunities to make his mark for England, especially in limited-overs cricket, without ever quite holding down a regular place. Six Tests without much of an impact and 36 ODIs with an average of 32, and excellent strike rate of 95, but only one half-century, told of a player whose consistency had not been adorned by big, eye-catching contributions.  \n', 'Patel has been involved in a permanent attempt to persuade England that his fitness levels are acceptable but he has never entirely managed it, not helped by the fact that the left-arm slows that made him an especially tempting option in Asia turned out to lack the guile to trouble the best players. ', ""His early career was full of promise. He represented England at Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 levels, and was awarded the Test Match Special Young Cricketer of the Year award in 2000 for his impressive performances in the Under-15 World Cup. He made his debut for Nottinghamshire 2nd XI at the age of just 14, in late 1999 but it wasn't until 2006 that he finally began to show signs of realising his potential, scoring 156 not out against Middlesex, an innings in which he went from 100 to 150 in just 17 balls."", ""Some of his most eye-catching performances came in Twenty20, including a unique double-wicket maiden against Derbyshire in 2006, but it was in 50-over cricket that he first attracted the interest of England's selectors, who picked him in his first international squad for the 2008 Champions Trophy. "", 'Patel impressed during his breakthrough season in 2008 where he played 11 ODIs in 2008, particularly during a haul of 5 for 41 to beat South Africa at The Oval. But instead of kicking on to greater things, his career stagnated, amid repeated failures to respond to the cajoling of the England management, and get into the gym to sort out his waistline. The county circuit did not lack for stories about accidents on treadmills or his penchant for chocolate bars', 'England\'s frustration was at its height ahead of the 2011 World Cup in the subcontinent. England desperately wanted to be able to include him for the slow, low wickets of India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and named him in their 30-man provisional squad, with the expectation that he would respond accordingly. ""All we were saying was \'get into reasonable shape\'. It didn\'t have to be perfect,"" said England\'s coach, Andy Flower.', 'That public rollicking appeared, finally, to have made the penny drop. Patel worked hard enough at his fitness before the 2011 season to have reached the basic targets laid out by England and he was rewarded with a recall to the limited-overs set-up after a strong start to the summer with Nottinghamshire, his first involvement for two-and-a-half years.', ""His work paid off as he passed 1,000 runs in a season for the first time and took 33 wickets for Nottinghamshire. He was one of few players to come out of England's ill-fated one-day tour of India in credit with 160 runs 40.00."", ""Patel was an England regular in limited-overs cricket when he earned a first Test call up for England's tour of Sri Lanka in March 2012.  Despite a modest domestic season in which he passed 50 only three times in first-class matches and had a top score of only 69, he was also selected for England's 2012-13 tour of India, where he made his first century in a senior England side in a warm-up match against India A and was selected for the first three Tests without ever making an impact. He then failed to win selection for World Twenty20 in Bangladesh shortly after predicting that, at 29, he was approaching his peak and had ambitions to play 200 times for England. Instead, he feared that total might end on 60.."", 'His slow left-arm was never more valuable for Notts than when a spell of 3 for 21 from seven overs helped Nottinghamshire beat Glamorgan by 87 runs in the 2013 YB40 final at Lord\'s to win their first limited-overs trophy for more than 20 years. But England\'s declining interest - even with his director of cricket Mick Newell now ensconced as a selector - began to weigh on him. With his Test ambitions high at the start of 2014, he averaged 52, only to average 23 after he failed be selected. Newell himself called that ""no coincidence"".', ""That run shortage continued in 2015, only for him to win a surprise call-up as England's third spinner for a Test series against Pakistan in the UAE, his chance coming when Zafar Ansari was injured in the field hours after being selected. Patel got his chance in the final Test, a victory for Pakistan which sealed the series, leaving the media - and the ECB - to agonise over discouraging conditions for English spinners in county cricket."", 'Never mind: in the county game, his best was yet to come. Patel was at the forefront of Nottinghamshire\'s excellent season in 2017 in which they regained their First Division place in the Championship at the first attempt and won both limited-overs trophies. His unbeaten 122 against Essex at Chelmsford as Notts pulled off a record 50-over chase in the semi-final was not just a fine innings but wonderful theatre. He took the man-of-the-match award in the T20 final at Edgbaston for his 64 off 42 balls against Birmingham Bears, completing his second run-out of Finals Day for added theatre. He then bemoaned - as was his habit - that England\'s selectors had not been in touch. Patel won both the PCA\'s Most Valuable Player award and the Players\' Player award - the first recognition for a Notts player since Richard Hadlee 30 years earlier. He had not always had the happiest relationship with England, but the accolade from his fellow professionals was a show of respect that left him ""chuffed to bits"".', '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2007'],6.0,9,0,151.0,42,16.77,338,44.67,0,0,16,1,3.0,0.0,36.0,22,7,482.0,70*,32.13,517,93.23,0,1,37,12,7.0,0.0,18.0,14,2,189.0,67,15.75,173,109.24,0,1,17,5,3.0,0.0,212.0,345,18,11976,257*,36.62,18927,63.27,26,59,,,134,0,236.0,205,32,6060,129*,35.02,7093,85.43,7,33,,,68,0,246.0,215,38,4577,90*,25.85,3673,124.61,0,28,426,132,73,0,6.0,10,858,421,7.0,2/27,3/164,60.14,2.94,122.5,0,0,0,36.0,32,1187,1091,24.0,5/41,5/41,45.45,5.51,49.4,0,1,0,18.0,15,252,321,7.0,2/6,2/6,45.85,7.64,36.0,0,0,0,212.0,,24465,12558,322,7/68,,39.00,3.07,75.9,11,5,1,236.0,,7940,7127,217,6/13,6/13,32.84,5.38,36.5,3,2,0,246.0,224,4469,5420,203,4/20,4/20,26.69,7.27,22.0,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

Graeme Swann made his England debut as a raw 20-year-old in 2000, in a nondescript one-day international in Bloemfontein, but it was a brief foray into the top level. Eight years later, having learnt his trade on the county scene with Northamptonshire and then Nottinghamshire, his Test debut came against India, at Chennai, and from that point he never looked back, becoming one of England's greatest spinners. \n"", ""In 60 Tests, he took 255 wickets at a touch under 30 runs apiece in a little more than five years, prolific wicket-taking exceeding anyone else in Test cricket in that period, with James  Anderson (232), Stuart Broad (207) and Dale Steyn (205) behind him. He retired as England's sixth highest wicket-taker, the leading offspinner and second among all England slow bowlers only to Derek Underwood, who took 297 wickets. He was wonderfully adaptable: attuned when necessary to a defensive role to allow the quicks in England's four-strong attack time to rest, and also blessed with the ability to dip and turn the ball markedly. He was also one of England's great character cricketers, refreshingly individualistic on and off the field, bringing fun wherever he played. He was a fine slip fielder, too, although the hours spent in the field, and the training grind necessary to achieve peak physical fitness, did not always some naturally to him."", ""As the new millennium dawned, there was a fear that traditional offspinners were becoming defunct at the highest level. Swann was one of a special band who challenged the notion. He did not have a doosra, but he had cunning, flight and turn. He was also helped by a striking number of left-handed batsmen at the highest levels and a growing use of technology which made it more likely that umpires would uphold lbw appeals. Of his 255 wickets, 70 were lbw, compared to Laker's 32 from 193; 121 of his victims were left-handers whereas Laker only returned 32. When he retired, he felt irreplaceable."", ""His debut at Chennai was marked by two wickets in his first over - the knack of striking in his first over would be a skill that stayed with him - and within a few months he had usurped Monty Panesar as England's premier spinner, a position he would not relinquish. Swann loved a wise-crack (his 2010-11 Ashes video diary became an internet hit) - a trait that did not endear him to all early in his career - but it would be unfair merely to brand him as a dressing-room joker. He was the ultimate competitor on the field, often bordering on feisty, and a master of his craft. His record showed the value of developing at domestic level and the fact he was pulled out of the international game as a youngster, almost as quickly as he was handed his chance, with the severe England coach at the time, Duncan Fletcher, not alone in regarding him as somewhat immature, perhaps saved him from being overwhelmed before he was ready."", ""After biding his time on the domestic circuit, he soon became a matchwinner at Test level and a key part of both the one-day side and Twenty20 sides. After a successful tour of West Indies (albeit in a losing cause) he played a key role in the 2009 Ashes victories at Lord's and The Oval. Further incisive spells followed over the years to come: South Africa in Durban, Bangladesh in Chittagong, Pakistan at Edgbaston and Lord's, Australia in Adelaide, Sri Lanka in Cardiff, India at The Oval, Sri Lanka in Colombo."", ""During the 2012 home season, Swann's career hit a blip. The snap and spark in his bowling disappeared for a time as he was superbly played by Hashim Amla. For only the second time in his Test career he was dropped: the Test at Headingley became infamous for a text-message furore which engulfed Kevin Pietersen. However, the following winter Swann was back to being a central figure, helping England to an historic series win in India, his alliance with Monty Panesar as they claimed 19 of the 20 wickets to fall representing one of the greatest spin-bowling double acts in England's Test history. "", ' dubbed them ""the dust devils"".', ""A recurrence of a long-standing elbow problem, which he has been forced to manage throughout his career, meant he required surgery in early 2013 and England were forced to contemplate life without Swann. He was back for that summer's Ashes, and took 26 wickets without ever being at his best, but he would not last the return series in Australia. The third Test in Perth proved to be his last. The last ball bowled he bowled in Test cricket flew deep into the Prindiville Stand at wide long-on; his final over went for 22, all to the whirring blade of Shane Watson. Seven wickets at 80 in the series, as he failed to get enough revolutions on the ball to remain a threat, represented an unhappy end."", 'With the Ashes lost after three Tests, Swann announced his retirement four days before the Boxing Day Test.  A tour which had started with such promise for England was by then in disarray: Jonathan Trott, the long-serving No 3, had already departed with a stress-related illness.  Swann\'s failure to see out the tour - even if only for appearances\' sake - brought some accusations of selfishness, but his elbow had become increasingly debilitating and, if the manner of his parting did not find universal approval, he had served England with distinction and provided endless fun along the way. He admitted later that he felt ""horrendous"" about quitting when he did, but on his career as a whole, he was in no doubt. ""I feel like a lottery winner,"" he said.\n', '\n', '\n', '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 1998'],60.0,76,14,1370.0,85,22.09,1791,76.49,0,5,181,19,54.0,0.0,79.0,48,12,500.0,34,13.88,553,90.41,0,0,48,4,29.0,0.0,39.0,16,11,104.0,34,20.80,89,116.85,0,0,9,1,5.0,0.0,252.0,343,37,7811,183,25.52,,,4,37,,,195,0,269.0,197,29,3179,83,18.92,,,0,14,,,88,0,80.0,54,15,791,90*,20.28,582,135.91,0,3,95,18,20,0,60.0,109,15349,7642,255.0,6/65,10/132,29.96,2.98,60.1,14,17,3,79.0,76,3809,2888,104.0,5/28,5/28,27.76,4.54,36.6,3,1,0,39.0,38,810,859,51.0,3/13,3/13,16.84,6.36,15.8,0,0,0,252.0,,47541,23741,739,7/33,,32.12,2.99,64.3,,32,6,269.0,,11165,8247,305,5/17,5/17,27.03,4.43,36.6,11,3,0,80.0,79,1692,1851,98,3/13,3/13,18.88,6.56,17.2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

And it's true that Ben Stokes' combative nature, allied to his powerful frame and outrageous talent, lifted a somewhat diffident England side to another level. Capable of turning games with his batting, his bowling and in the field - through his character as much as his deeds - Stokes soon attracted comparisons with Ian Botham. Expectations were huge. \n"", 'It is his misfortune therefore that he may be most remembered for two episodes he would rather forget. The first came in the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup final in Kolkata. Asked to defend 19 in the last over against West Indies, his attempted yorkers missed the mark by inches resulting in Carlos Brathwaite heaving him for four successive sixes into a sweltering night sky.', ""The second, and altogether more serious, incident occurred in September 2017. Celebrating an ODI victory in Bristol, Stokes became embroiled in a fight outside a club in the early hours of the morning that resulted in his arrest. A trial at Bristol Crown Court subsequently saw him cleared of the charge of affray but by then the reputational damage had been done. He had already missed the 2017-18 Ashes tour - a toothless England were beaten 4-0 with Stokes not considered for selection - and been stripped of the team's vice-captaincy. "", 'He could console himself with the knowledge that he had the time and the ability to ensure he was remembered for more positive reasons. Within months of his comeback, Stokes had played a key role in England\'s 3-0 Test win in Sri Lanka, their first whitewash series victory in Asia. Trevor Bayliss praised Stokes\' attitude as ""exemplary"", saying he had ""learned his lesson"". ', 'Stokes, from the moment he made his Durham debut, felt very much a product of the northeast of England. He was actually born in Christchurch, New Zealand and came from a rich sporting pedigree with his father, Ged, playing international Rugby League for that country.', 'His prodigious talent was clear from an early age. A true allrounder, Stokes debuted for Durham at 17 and dismissed Mark Ramprakash with his third legal delivery in senior cricket. He enjoyed a productive time at the 2009 Under-19 World Cup, scoring a century against India, before registering a maiden fifty on his first-class debut for Durham. But it was in 2011 that he really began to blossom. In April he took 6 for 68 and scored a brilliant hundred that included five sixes in an over, and a month later registered his maiden limited-overs ton. A broken finger hindered his bowling, but he played for England Lions and made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin, going on to play four times against India, albeit with limited impact.', ""A first brush with the management was to follow, after being called up to the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia in early 2013. Stokes ended up being sent home with three matches remaining, along with Kent's Matt Coles, after two breaches of discipline. It was a watershed moment, and he was rapidly rehabilitated back at Durham, playing a key role in their Championship-winning season and being recalled to England's limited-overs teams. He took a maiden ODI five-for and won selection for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, a return to Australia that would command attention for the right reasons."", ""Stokes' performances were a rare bright spot on a disastrous trip. When the agony was all over, only Stokes returned to England as a star on the rise. Brought into the XI at Adelaide, after Jonathan Trott's untimely departure, his pugnacious nature came to the fore during a maiden Test hundred in Perth, a doughty response out of keeping with England's general demeanour throughout the tour."", 'But with fire came combustibility. Stokes missed the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh after reacting to a dismissal in Barbados by punching a dressing room locker and sustaining a broken wrist. During a difficult year, he was dropped from the Test team after making three ducks in a row against India, and then lost his one-day place on the tour of Sri Lanka - ultimately missing out on selection for the 2015 World Cup.', ""Stokes, like England after a dismal tournament, needed rejuvenating. It began with the Lord's Test against New Zealand, when Stokes scored 92 and 101 after being promoted to bat at No. 6. A successful Ashes followed and he was also a central figure in the new-look ODI side that began to put the World Cup behind them under the guidance of Bayliss and Paul Farbrace. A few months later he produced a barnstorming 258 from 198 balls against South Africa in Cape Town - the fastest England double-hundred in history and the second fastest of all time - during a stand of 399 with Jonny Bairstow."", ""Following his Kolkata nightmare, he nevertheless grew in stature within the side and was promoted to the vice-captaincy (at least until the Bristol episode). He scored his maiden ODI hundred in Dhaka in late 2016 and added four more across international formats the following year, while also taking Test-best figures of 6 for 22 against West Indies at Lord's, becoming a key cog for England despite a chequered injury record."", 'An IPL millionaire twice over - he was bought for £1.7m by Rising Pune Supergiant in 2017, winning tournament MVP, and then picked up for £1.4m the following season by Rajasthan Royals - Stokes was one of the most talked-about players in the world. But there was a sense the best was yet to come. Going into 2019, a year containing an Ashes series and a World Cup, he looked to be a player at the peak of his powers who had finally understood the level of sacrifice and discipline required to coax the best out of his undoubted talent.

For Roy, a Surrey opener of dashing disposition, such a change of emphasis was ideal. His maiden ODI ton had come before the World Cup, against Pakistan in Dubai, but it was in 2016 under the leadership of Eoin Morgan, adamant that England must play free-spirited cricket, that Roy found his voice, making two ODI hundreds against Sri Lanka in England, the second of them - a career-best 162, the second highest ODI score made at the time by an England batsman - coming in front of his adoring home crowd at The Oval. \n"", ""There was even better to come. In banishing the blues of an Ashes Test thrashing in 2017-18, Roy surpassed Alex Hales' record one-day score for England of 171 with 180 in Melbourne as Australia recognised an England one-day side performing with a freedom of expression that surpassed anything they could muster in response. This was far removed from the batsman who had endured such a dud season in Australia's Big Bash competition."", ""Born in South Africa, Roy came to the UK aged 10 and soon started to move through the system. He was a hugely successful schoolboy cricketer for Whitgift, and made his Surrey debut as a 17-year-old in 2008 during the Twenty20 Cup and his fielding talents were noticed by England, who used him as a sub later that summer against South Africa. It wasn't until 2010 that he broke into the first team again. He promptly thumped 101 off 57 balls against Kent at Beckenham, Surrey's first T20 hundred. Later in the summer he struck an unbeaten 76 from 65 balls against Leicestershire on Championship debut. England's selectors gave him a place on the Performance Programme tour to India before the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka in early 2012."", ""Roy's obvious ability in the shorter formats led to him twice winning T20 contracts in the Bangladesh Premier League but he struggled to build on a quietly impressive role in Surrey's 2011 promotion campaign, when he made his maiden first-class hundred. In 2013, he made two YB40 centuries - doubling his List A tally - but struggled badly in Championship cricket, scoring just 49 runs in seven innings."", ""It was in 2014 that Roy made the leap from a prodigiously talented but erratic young cricketer to a consistent match-winner. The transformation was particularly evident in the NatWest T20 Blast, where he struck 677 runs at 48.35 apiece - the highest tally in the competition. England's T20 competition had undeniably produced an exciting batsman of international quality. Roy's uncomplicated clean-striking became as much a feature of Friday nights at The Oval as the beer-snakes and streakers. With his breathtaking power down the ground and penchant for switch-hitting - not to mention the fact he was born in South Africa - he was frequently compared to Kevin Pietersen, not least by Pietersen himself. His brilliance did not achieve the same levels in the following two summers - how could it? - but a destructive hundred against Somerset in 2015, and against Kent the following year, was a reminder of his unfettered talent."", 'After working hard on pacing his innings in four-day cricket, Roy also blossomed in Championship cricket in 2014, hitting 1078 runs, the highest at the club, at an average of 50-plus without reigning in his destructiveness: his strike rate was still 84. He also averaged 47.65 in the Championship in a promotion year in 2015, his strike rate even higher.  ', ""By the summer's end, he was rewarded with a T20 international debut against India and in 2015 he became a fixture in England's limited-overs formats, building on a couple of promising 60s against Australia with a maiden ODI ton against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, an innings that was rarely fluent - and that was entirely overshadowed by Jos Buttler's dash to his own hundred in record time - but one that provided proof of a growing survival mentality."", 'Kevin Pietersen, a former Surrey team-mate as well as also sharing a South African birthplace, called for Roy to bat at No 6 for England in Tests the following summer, saying it would make England fans ""so happy"". Although Pietersen seemed oblivious to it, Roy\'s international form had faltered.

As well as the Melbourne 180 (which also included a record-breaking 221 stand for the third wicket with Joe Root), there were further hundreds against Australia in Cardiff and Chester-le-Street, often accompanied by the plaintiff - and ignored - cry from Pietersen that his imagined protégé should win a chance at Test level.', '\n']",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,73.0,71,2,2661.0,180,38.56,2522,105.51,7,12,314,45,29.0,0.0,32.0,32,0,743.0,78,23.21,512,145.11,0,4,75,35,5.0,0.0,81.0,132,11,4645,143,38.38,5657,82.11,9,22,618,72,73.0,0.0,166.0,159,7,5658,180,37.22,5309,106.57,14,28,685,96,66.0,0.0,192.0,188,9,4882,122*,27.27,3349,145.77,4,31,531,193,83.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,73.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,32.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,81.0,25,712,495,14,3/9,4/47,35.35,4.17,50.8,0,0,0,166.0,1,6,12,0,-,-,-,12.00,-,0,0,0,192.0,2,18,39,1,1/23,1/23,39.00,13.00,18.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

The accolade everybody anticipated became his three years later, when Alastair Cook stood down after the 2016-17 tour of India. It was understandable that there were a few fears for Root's future workload. He was rare among England batsmen in achieving maturity so quickly, and had looked consumed by the delights of batting from the moment he first took guard. Now he had new responsibilities.  \n"", ""Slight of build, perky of shot and with a scampish grin that got under a bowler's skin, by the time Root was appointed Test captain he had rattled up 53 Tests within five years with an average top side of 50, comfortably the highest among contemporary England players. Early expectations that he would establish himself as an opener did not materialise as an expansive game increasingly seemed better suited to No. 3 or No. 4. He was equally influential in limited-overs cricket where England's commitment to fearless cricket after their 2015 World Cup was much to his tastes, his crispness of stroke and shrewd judgment enabling him to bat purposefully around batsmen of greater weight of shot."", ""Root had never been a strikingly heavy scorer as he worked through the ranks, nor was he particularly athletic, but his systematic approach was that of a young batsman who would not sell his wicket easily and gave England hope that he would be able to attune his game to the highest level. A slender batsman reliant on precision, his patience and stubbornness at the crease had Geoffrey Boycott gushing that he reminded him of himself, although Root soon developed a much broader range. Others saw some of his mentor Michael Vaughan in Root's front-foot drive - the pair also both attended Sheffield Collegiate."", ""Root's Test debut for England in Nagpur in 2012 exemplified the qualities which had attracted coaches from an early age. Picked to tour India on the strength of two encouraging seasons with Yorkshire - and having been named Cricket Writers' Club Young Player of the Year - he impressed enough to be selected for the final Test of the series. He began with England's sixth-longest debut innings in terms of balls faced, scoring 73 from 229 balls as he displayed the patience and discrimination demanded both by the situation of the game and a desperately slow surface. "", ""His rise continued with a maiden Test hundred in his home ground, Headingley, against New Zealand in 2013 followed by a maiden Ashes century at Lord's having been promoted to open. Root looked set to occupy that role for many years to come, but his fortunes dipped as the series went on and then crashed along with the team as England were whitewashed in Australia in 2013-14. He began the tour at No. 6, moved up to No. 3 after the enforced departure of Jonathan Trott, then saw his Ashes ended early when he was dropped for the fifth Test in Sydney."", ""Proof of Root's ability came in the way he responded. Back in England, he followed up a two-tone double hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's - a disciplined innings with a freewheeling finale - with two more big hundreds against India. All three had the not-out asterisk. That seemed to say a lot about him."", 'He even had the fortune to skipper Yorkshire to the Championship title at Trent Bridge in 2014 when Andrew Gale was suspended, less than a fortnight after he became the first Yorkshire batsman to hit an ODI hundred at Headingley, with India the victims. He was also in charge for Yorkshire\'s thumping defeat at Middlesex, in which they chased down 472 in the fourth innings. To his amusement, his team-mates dubbed him ""Craptain"". ', ""His full potential then poured forth in 2015 when he made 1385 Test runs in the year, and vied with Australia's Steven Smith at the top of the ICC Test rankings. Root played with alacrity on all surfaces and in all formats and his obvious delight in his art was a positive symbol in an England side committed in all formats to a more enterprising approach. Jaunty Ashes hundreds at Cardiff and Nottingham helped England to victories, his consistency at No. 4 repeatedly masked top-order frailties, and a mischievous sense of humour made his success all the more pleasurable."", 'As England fell to defeat against Pakistan in the UAE in late 2015, a pattern began to build up which piqued Root even as he confirmed himself as one of the best batsmen around: his world became rather too full of entertaining 70s and 80s when he felt that a big hundred was there for the taking. Between his hundred in Johannesburg in early 2016 on a triumphant England tour and a century in Rajkot as England slumped 4-0 to India, he passed 50 six times but only converted one into a hundred. There again, it was quite a hundred: a career-best 254 against Pakistan at Old Trafford that banished talk of premature burnout in a non-stop England programme.', 'Firmly established among the modern game\'s ""Big Four"" batsmen (Root, Smith, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson), these were years of easy scoring. In 2015 and 2016 he set consecutive records for runs accumulated across all formats in a calendar year for England, with 2228 and 2570 respectively; in 2017, he came within five runs of surpassing Vaughan\'s calendar high-water mark of 1481 for England in Tests, which had stood since 2002. The following summer, with back-to-back efforts against India, Root surpassed Marcus Trescothick\'s English record of 12 ODI hundreds.', ""Problems of conversion returned to afflict him in his second year as Test captain, however. Having made a matchwinning 190 against South Africa at Lord's, in his first match in charge, and a century in England's first day-night Test, against West Indies at Edgbaston, he went more than a year before again reaching three figures in a Test. That period included another unsuccessful Ashes tour of Australia, where Root topped the England averages but could only manage a highest score of 83. Defeat in New Zealand followed, then a messy draw at home to Pakistan, before England rallied to beat No. 1 side India 4-1 and give Root encouragement in his plans to rebuild the Test side."", '\n', '\n']",[],80.0,147,12,6685.0,254,49.51,12059,55.43,16,41,755,19,91.0,0.0,126.0,119,19,5090.0,133*,50.9,5871,86.69,14,29,407,40,57.0,0.0,31.0,29,5,846.0,90*,35.25,665,127.21,0,5,87,16,18.0,0.0,137.0,239,22,10474,254,48.26,18614,56.26,25,56,1226,29,128.0,0.0,165.0,157,25,6374,133*,48.28,7472,85.30,15,38,523,45,69.0,0.0,71.0,65,13,1572,92*,30.23,1246,126.16,0,9,175,24,32.0,0.0,80.0,70,1968,986,20.0,2/9,2/9,49.3,3.00,98.4,0,0,0,126.0,60,1342,1299,20.0,3/52,3/52,64.95,5.80,67.1,0,0,0,31.0,9,84,139,6.0,2/9,2/9,23.16,9.92,14.0,0,0,0,137.0,124,3613,1840,40,4/5,4/5,46.00,3.05,90.3,1,0,0,165.0,85,1929,1798,34,3/52,3/52,52.88,5.59,56.7,0,0,0,71.0,31,264,415,10,2/9,2/9,41.50,9.43,26.4,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

6 ft 4 in ",,,Left-hand bat,Left-arm fast-medium,,Father - ,,"[""\nRyan Sidebottom, with his unruly mop of curly, ginger hair, has long been one of the most recognisable and respected figures on the county circuit. His international career is now behind him but he can draw much satisfaction not only from the manner in which he took a belated second chance in international cricket, but the way that latterly he has committed himself with skill and determination to an extended career on England's professional circuit with Yorkshire, the county of his birth. \n"", 'Like his father Arnie, who was an accomplished footballer and one-time Test player, Ryan made his county debut for Yorkshire having previously impressed the scouts of Sheffield United Football Club. For much of his career it appeared Sidebottom jnr, a left-armer unlike Arnie, would also follow his father in Test cricket by remaining a one-cap wonder. He was handed his debut in 2001 against Pakistan, but after a wicketless performance was banished back to county cricket. Although he bowled tidily throughout, he was generally considered to be out of his depth and was quickly discarded, and seemingly forgotten after two poor ODIs against Zimbabwe that October. He proved them wrong, possessing a resolve and bowling nous that few had recognised.', 'He left Yorkshire in 2004 and headed to nearby Nottinghamshire, where he impressed in his first two seasons. The first year there he helped them to a double promotion, and the second year he took 50 first-class wickets to become the Player of the Year and help them to the Championship title for the first time in 18 years.', ""With Duncan Fletcher, England's coach, obsessed by finding bowlers of true pace, Sidebottom was continually overlooked despite having one of the best records in the country. However, six years after his debut - under the new Peter Moores regime - he was surprisingly recalled after a spate of injuries to England's attack. He responded with eight wickets against West Indies at Headingley, still his spiritual home, and developed into a key member of the line-up. He helped England to a 3-0 win over West Indies before bowling without luck against India."", ""Equally impressive with the white ball he was Man of the Series as England won the one-day tournament in Sri Lanka, but it was during the New Zealand leg of England's winter that he really shone, decimating the hosts with 24 wickets at 17.08, including 7 for 47 in the final Test in Napier."", ""Further success followed in the home series against New Zealand, during which he was unveiled as England's Player of the Year, but the pressures of carrying England's attack took their toll, and he struggled for fitness thereafter, culminating in an Achilles injury that limited him to a single wicket in an arduous tour of the Caribbean in February 2009. While injuries dented his opportunities in Test cricket thereafter he became an important member of the one-day side. In the 2010 World Twenty20 in the Caribbean his selection ahead of James Anderson raised a few eyebrows, but he proved the doubters wrong as his fiery and disciplined opening bowling was a crucial part of England's triumph."", 'His England career, though, ended with his international retirement late in 2010, leaving him to play out time on the domestic scene. After helping Nottinghamshire to a last-gasp Championship title that summer, he returned to his Yorkshire roots for the final stage of his career.', 'Given that Yorkshire were relegated it was not immediately the return he hoped for, although on a personal level 2011 was a highly successful season. His 62 first-class wickets at 22.00, including three five-wicket hauls and a career best 7 for 37 against Somerset at Headingley, were the most he had taken in a single season. He contributed useful runs, too, including two fifties in an aggregate of 389 in the Championship. His 61 against Worcestershire at New Road was a career best. ', ""He missed a large part of the 2012 promotion season to injury but signed a further contract extension until the end of 2015 towards the end of a summer which saw him lead Yorkshire's Championship bowling records with 49 wickets at 20.30 apiece. He won the Members' Player of the Year award as a result, and hankered after 700 first-class wickets before he took his boots off for the last time. He achieved a landmark achieved by few in spectacular style against Middlesex as Yorkshire completed successive Championship wins, taking four wickets in his first four overs, including a hat-trick, and topping the county averages at 37. Five years on from his international retirement, his longevity was deeply impressive."", 'As well as leaving his father, Arnie - 596 first-class victims - by now a long way in his slipstream, he also had five Championship titles, adding two with Yorkshire to the three won with Notts. He swung the ball as consistently as any bowler on the county circuit and his accuracy was exemplary.

Following Michael Vaughan\'s return home due to injury early in the tour, Shah was drafted in as a replacement and made a composed and vital 88 in a memorable victory. A stylish and classical batsman who seemed to have the world at his feet as a teenager, he was compared in ability to the young Mark Ramprakash. Shah made his first-class debut in 1996, and at the end of the promising summer, Wisden praised his ""abundant promise"". His county cap followed, but back-to-back seasons with averages in the mid 20s ended with him being dropped by Middlesex in 2000.  \n', ""He bounced back in 2001 in fine form, and was drafted into England's one-day side in the NatWest Series where he looked at ease, especially when making 62 against Pakistan at Lord's.

He was overlooked in 2002, but again played a few one-dayers the following winter in the ICC Knock-out Trophy and in the VB Series, but he found it almost impossible to forge a place in the side.  Another solid season followed, but others edged ahead of him in the pecking order, and there was talk that his fielding was not helping his cause. His international ambitions suffered a further blow when he was relieved of the vice-captaincy at Middlesex in June 2004 after a string of bad results. However, a feast of runs in 2005 (1728 runs at a healthy average of 66.46) led to his inclusion in the England A tour of the Caribbean in 2006, and ultimately his Test debut. Further opportunities were thin on the ground, however. He had to wait 18 months for his second Test - another one-off appearance, this time at Lord's against West Indies where he failed twice - but a series of eyecatching performances followed in the one-day series, as England rebuilt after another disappointing World Cup campaign. Despite the continued failings of England's top 6, he was but a spectator and drinks carrier for the Test tours of Sri Lanka and New Zealand."", ""Good county form and half-centuries in the home ODIs against New Zealand ensured he travelled to India at the end of 2008, and he finally got his opportunity in the Caribbean the following spring, following the selectors' temporary loss of patience with Ian Bell. An anxious Shah failed to cement his position, however, with his uncertain running-between-the-wickets proving his downfall, and he was overlooked for the subsequent home summer as Ravi Bopara leapt into the No. 3 position."", ""Though he remained a key figure in the one-day set-up, he was surprisingly axed for the tour of South Africa in 2009-10, despite a memorable 98 from 89 balls in the Champions Trophy that preceded it. As England settled on a formula that delivered both Twenty20 and one-day success it appeared as though Shah's international career was over and he was dealt a further blow when he was unceremoniously released by Middlesex at the end of the 2010 season and signed for Essex, although his debut was delayed by the IPL. Decent returns in 2011 and 2012 saw him retained by Essex on a further one-year deal but Shah was an increasingly itinerant cricketer, taking in stints in Australia's Big Bash and the Bangladesh Premier League as he moved towards a career as a T20 specialist.

She is a genuine all-rounder who, on the back of impressive performances for Surrey in the County Championship in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, was called up for England for their 2013 series against Pakistan. She stormed onto the international scene that summer, taking 3 for 28 against Pakistan and claiming the Player of the Match award in only her second ODI. \n', ""A skiddy, accurate medium-pacer, in October 2013 in a match against New Zealand she became the first English cricketer, male or female, to take a T20I hat-trick.

When it is a young legspinner the hype is magnified. When it is a young spinner of Pakistani extraction, brought up in Yorkshire, the sense of excitement becomes palpable. Adil Rashid, the player who above all symbolized Yorkshire's growing success in fostering strong relationships in its minority ethnic communities, burst onto the scene with six wickets against Warwickshire on his first-class debut in 2006 at Scarborough. There was a sense in Yorkshire's much-loved seaside town that afternoon as Rashid cut through Warwickshire that a historic breakthrough had been made and more than one Yorkshire supporter observed Rashid's performance with hearts uplifted. \n"", 'A decade later, as he left a tour of India in which England had been trounced 4-0, it was still occasionally possible to see the vulnerable, taciturn 18-year-old of whom Yorkshire were so protective. Rashid had 10 Test caps, all of them in the UAE or South Asia where England needed a second spinner, but even on such surfaces he needed careful handling in case his leg spin succumbed under the pressure. He seemed happiest in limited-overs cricket where the game unfolded in a more predictable fashion and he knew that batsmen would be committed to attack. It was hard to imagine him as a single spinner in England unless he became more serviceable, but such had been remarked of countless legspinners before him.', ""A five-wicket haul on debut against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi after a return of 0 for plenty in the first innings augured well (setting up a short run chase which England narrowly failed to achieve) and he also brushed up well a year later in Dhaka at the start of England's 2016-17 tour of Bangladesh and India. His India series gradually took a turn for the worse, however, the promise of Rajkot and Visakhapatnam giving way to a more pessimistic air - and some hefty figures in the runs column - in Mumbai and Chennai. He had the ability to hoover up a tail at both England and county level; sometimes the problem was getting to it."", ""In the limited-overs formats, Rashid was a vital component of England's attack and a first-class average with the bat in the mid-30s told of a player who would not have been consigned to the tail in many England XIs in the past."", ""Rashid's also caught the eye early in his career for England Under-19s nd an eight-wicket haul during the second Test against India. But he suffered a stress fracture in his back in the close season which forced him to remodel his action. His profile rose further in 2007 when he struck his maiden Championship century against Worcestershire in August and at the end of the season the Cricket Writers' Club made him their Young Cricketer of the Year. In 2008 he enjoyed his most prolific season with 62 wickets in the County Championship and was a late addition to the squad for the Test series in India. That trip was purely for experience, however, as was the tour to West Indies which followed, but even so his career shone with potential."", 'Rashid responded the following season with 545 runs at 68.12, including two hundreds, and picked up 31 wickets at 36.06 in the 2009 first-class season. His statistics in one-day and Twenty20 cricket were more modest, but the selectors held faith in his potential, and he made his England debut during the World Twenty in June of that year. He also played in the post-Ashes one-day series against Australia, but his most notable achievement came with the bat when he scored a quickfire 31 in a narrow defeat at The Oval.', 'Rashid was included in the party to tour South Africa in 2009-10, but had a difficult time on the trip. He began amid high hopes that his combination of legspin and promising lower-order batting could cement a permanent role in the side, but his solitary over in the second Twenty20 went for 25, then he bowled three overs for 27 in the second ODI before being left out for a fit-again Graeme Swann. When he was released from the one-day party, James Tredwell, the Kent offspinner, remained on stand-by which suggested Rashid had fallen down the pecking order. ', ""Andy Flower, England's coach, rightly suggested that he would benefit from a chance to deepen his game at county level, but progress was not immediate. Yorkshire, by now, were showing signs of disquiet over Rashid's bowling. England had demanded that he bowled much quicker and his confidence and method had deserted him when he returned from international duty. His county form faltered, although he did win a place in the England Lions squad to tour UAE and was called-up briefly for the end of the World Cup campaign."", 'At home, Rashid enjoyed his most productive season for Yorkshire in 2010, scoring 732 first-class runs at 45.75 and taking 57 wickets at 31.29. He began the 2011 season with a bang, taking 6 for 77 and 5 for 37 to secure victory against Worcestershire at New Road, the best figures for a leg-spinner in Yorkshire history, but failed to maintain his form, finishing the season with 39 wickets at 43.38. From 10 Championship matches in 2012 he totalled only 16 wickets and 129 runs and his discontent was apparent. ', ""Rashid was at a crossroads. But more than 800 Championship runs at 50-plus in 2013 suggested that in his mid-20s not just his batting was maturing, and his bowling became more thoughtful, and dangerous in turn with a good googly particularly evident. Yorkshire's challenge was to bring his career to fruition, to bring him not just success on the field but a general contentment. A career that had begun with so much optimism began to reawaken England's interest again - cagily at first with a Lions recall - as Yorkshire won the title in 2014. The appointment of Trevor Bayliss as coach coincided with his return to the England side for the first time in nearly six years, a string of limited-overs displays being joined by limited success in his first three Tests, against Pakistan on the slow, big turners of the UAE."", 'He was a much-loved figure on Yorkshire grounds, contributing to back-to-back Championships in 2014 and 15, and dubbed ""The Hoover"" by the head coach Jason Gillespie. But his request to rest out a title decider against Middlesex at Lord\'s the following year - he later explained that his grandmother was unwell - exasperated his captain, Andrew Gale. Gale\'s appointment as Yorkshire\'s coach at the end of the season suggested that conversation was not entirely finished.', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2006, 2007, 2008', ""Cricket Writers' Club 2007 Young Cricketer of the Year""]",19.0,33,5,540.0,61,19.28,1270,42.51,0,2,62,4,4.0,0.0,83.0,36,9,529.0,69,19.59,526,100.57,0,1,59,6,25.0,0.0,36.0,14,8,47.0,9*,7.83,55,85.45,0,0,4,0,10.0,0.0,175.0,251,41,6822,180,32.48,,,10,37,,,79.0,0.0,198.0,116,33,1626,71,19.59,1802,90.23,0,2,148,16,63.0,0.0,163.0,85,32,682,36*,12.86,648,105.24,0,0,49,11,47.0,0.0,19.0,34,3816,2390,60.0,5/49,7/178,39.83,3.75,63.6,5,2,0,83.0,77,4090,3807,128.0,5/27,5/27,29.74,5.58,31.9,7,2,0,36.0,34,708,863,36.0,3/11,3/11,23.97,7.31,19.6,0,0,0,175.0,287,29901,17949,512,7/107,11/114,35.05,3.60,58.4,28,20,1,198.0,186,9063,8177,272,5/27,5/27,30.06,5.41,33.3,10,3,0,163.0,157,3321,4086,186,4/19,4/19,21.96,7.38,17.8,5,0,0,False,False,False,False

When he retired in 2018, having not played a game in his final summer, he had taken 830 wickets for Kent in 613 matches since making his debut in 2000 and also made a decent contribution to England in difficult times. \n"", ""He had racked up almost a decade of unswerving county service by the time England gave him the first of his 45 ODI caps, against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2010, and his offspin - bowled in a more old-fashioned, slower style than was the norm among many of his international contemporaries - has given England stout service. Such is Tredwell's unfashionable air that he was content to talk ahead of an England tour of his hobby making home-made jam and chutney, and imagined packing a couple of jars to help him through his latest overseas assignment.  In Kent in particular, they valued his gentle talents, backed up by excellent close catching and some useful lower-order batting.  As Vic Marks wrote in "", ': ""James Tredwell is not and never will be a superstar. He is the journeyman\'s journeyman and a fine antidote to the celebrity cricketer.""', ""\nIt was as a limited-overs cricketer that Tredwell also made most of his early appearances for Kent but by 2003 he was representing the county in both forms of the game on a regular basis. He captained the England Under-19s side and led Kent second XI to success in the Second XI Trophy final of 2002 when he scored 111. His obvious potential elevated him to a place in the ECB National Academy squad for 2003-04, where he found himself captaining the squad in difficult circumstances following the withdrawal of Alex Gidman. His performances earned him a call up to the England Performance Squad in the winter of 2007. He was subsequently rewarded with inclusion in England's one-day squad for their tour of New Zealand in 2008."", ""Tredwell didn't get a game on that tour, but steady performances with the England Lions and Kent, including a career-best 123 not out against a touring New Zealand side and 69 wickets in the County Championship in 2009 kept him in contention. He was called up as cover for Swann during England's tour to South Africa in 2009-10 and, although once again he did not feature in a starting XI, he was included in the Lions tour to UAE in February 2010. His consistent performances booked him a place in England's squad to tour Bangladesh in February and March 2010 and he finally made his debut in the second Test at Dhaka, taking six wickets in England's nine-wicket win.  He was one of four spinners chosen for England's tour of Sri Lanka in March 2012 and he played a part in the one-day series against Australia and South Africa that summer."", ""With Swann rested, he made his T20 international debut in India in December 2012 and then followed that up with 11 wickets in the ODIs that followed after Christmas. He was a very different character to the extrovert - and highly successful - Swann and, if he was unlikely ever to hit such heights, he made international cricket seem a polite place to be. His progress as an offspinner was steady rather than spectacular but he had a steady temperament and ability to vary his pace good habits can bring rewards and they started to come thick and fast. England's interest did not extend to Test cricket: he won his first of two caps against Bangladesh in Dhaka and, following Swann's sudden retirement during a Test whitewash in Australia in 2013-14, England looked elsewhere the following summer before giving him a second cap in Antigua in 2015."", ""Tredwell's was named Kent captain for 2013, following Rob Key's decision to stand down. But his form in first-class cricket had by then become less impressive than in the shorter formats and, under challenge from the tyro Adam Riley, he even accepted a loan spell at Sussex in 2014 in search of regular cricket before returning to Kent at the end of the season and settling back in with typical economy in the limited-overs formats."", 'England\'s disastrous World Cup campaign in Australia in 2015, though, ended his England career at 33. Peter Moores was sacked as coach, Trevor Bayliss took over and a new high-energy brand of cricket had no place for him. ""Sometimes a change of view means that some people are put on the rubbish tip,"" he said. When he fell out of favour with Kent in 2017, he sought discussions with other counties to try to attain regular cricket, but his career was nearing its end.', '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2003'],2.0,2,0,45.0,37,22.5,87,51.72,0,0,6,0,2.0,0.0,45.0,25,11,163.0,30,11.64,242,67.35,0,0,9,4,14.0,0.0,17.0,6,3,32.0,22,10.66,20,160.0,0,0,4,1,2.0,0.0,177.0,247,31,4728,124,21.88,10768,43.90,4,17,,,196.0,0.0,270.0,174,63,1917,88,17.27,,,0,4,,,110.0,0.0,166.0,74,27,519,34*,11.04,489,106.13,0,0,47,8,48.0,0.0,2.0,4,786,321,11.0,4/47,6/181,29.18,2.45,71.4,2,0,0,45.0,44,2104,1666,60.0,4/41,4/41,27.76,4.75,35.0,3,0,0,17.0,15,317,416,7.0,1/16,1/16,59.42,7.87,45.2,0,0,0,177.0,,30574,15439,426,8/66,,36.24,3.02,71.7,21,12,3,270.0,,11606,9076,276,6/27,6/27,32.88,4.69,42.0,9,1,0,166.0,158,3242,3964,128,4/21,4/21,30.96,7.33,25.3,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

His energy and enthusiasm seems boundless, whether he is smiting sixes with intent in one-day cricket, fielding with athleticism or producing a spell of bustling medium pace which never appears to be quite as fast as he wants it to be. He has always had ambitions to play Test cricket, but he has never quite managed to make the leap.  It is the limited-overs game that suits his talents and, if he is a reluctant Twenty20 specialist, it is the form of the game where his talents are most apparent. \n', 'That Test debut was never closer than when Andrew Flintoff retired from Test cricket after the 2009 Ashes series. He was called up to England\'s Test squad for the first time for the winter tour of South Africa. Geoff Miller, England\'s chairman of selectors, remarked: ""The retirement of Andrew Flintoff has created a vacancy for an allrounder… we believe Luke can make an impact at Test level."" Wright was expected to play in the first Test, but England decided upon a policy of six specialist batsmen.', 'Wright represented England Under-19s, won the Denis Compton medal four times and scored a century on his Championship debut for Sussex. He spent two winters at the National Academy based at Loughborough University, where he was right at home having studied Sports Science and Sports Massage there. He was also a key part of the Sussex team that won the C&G Trophy in 2006. The following year he smashed his maiden domestic Twenty20 Cup century, scoring 103 from only 45 balls against Kent at Canterbury.  Although Sussex were defeated in the semi-finals, Wright finished as the highest run scorer in the competition with 346 runs.', ""That captured England's attention. A whirlwind century for England Lions against the New Zealand tourists even brought loose talk of a Test debut. Instead, he was selected in the ODI team at The Oval later that summer, hitting 50 on debut against India although he drifted out of the one-day set-up following the 2011 World Cup with his bowling never quite strong enough to hold down a fifth bowler's spot. He careered up and down the batting order more than was good for him."", ""Wright performed admirably in England's World Twenty20-winning team in 2010. He contributed 90 runs in significant circumstances during England's successful campaign, and though he bowled only one over in the tournament, it was a pivotal one - he got rid of the in-form Cameron White in the final against Australia. He was also one of England's most combative performers in a less impressive campaign in Sri Lanka in 2012, his unbeaten 99 against Afghanistan in Colombo coming desperately close to making him the first England batsman to hit a T20 hundred. An injury ruled him out of the 2014 event in Bangladesh and when he was quietly omitted from England's squads at the start of Peter Moores' second term in charge his international prospects looked bleak."", 'He has also been in demand around the world for domestic T20 tournaments, playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia\'s Big Bash and Pune Warriors at the IPL. A sparkling 44-ball hundred against Hobart Hurricanes in the inaugural Big Bash League in 2011-12 was the fastest at that point in Australia\'s domestic competition. England\'s reversal of their international calendar in 2014, with the season beginning with one-day cricket, did not promote his cause at the IPL, where he did not attract a bid and, consigned once more to the start of a Championship season at Sussex, described his fate as ""woolly hat time.""', ""Wright's T20 skills were still evident, though. He smashed an unbeaten 153 with 11 sixes - at the time the fourth highest ever T20 score - as Sussex, who made 226 for 3, pulled off a world-record run chase with nine balls to spare. All the more remarkable as Sussex's players had been stuck in traffic approaching Chelmsford and Wright had joked on Twitter that any Sussex fan in the vicinity made like to open the innings. "", ""Sussex's valuation of his energy and optimism led them to give him the T20 captaincy in 2015 and follow up with leadership in all formats for the following season only for him to be afflicted by injury in a generally below-par season. Captaincy did not suit him and he resigned midway through 2017, stating that the responsibility had drained the enjoyment from his game and affected him on and off the field."", 'Wright ended his long involvement with Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash in 2018, slightly prematurely after a bout of concussion. The club referenced a ""stellar career"", involving 57 matches and 1,479 runs. That he still had much to give, however, was apparent at Blast Finals Day at Edgbaston later that year when his 53-ball 92 against Glamorgan in the semi-final set up his 300th T20 appearance in the final, Sussex being unable to deliver a trophy to mark it as they fell to Worcestershire.\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2002', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2004', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2005', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2007']",0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,50.0,39,4,707.0,52,20.2,820,86.21,0,2,63,18,18.0,0.0,51.0,45,5,759.0,99*,18.97,554,137.0,0,4,68,31,14.0,0.0,144.0,223,23,7622,226*,38.11,11628,65.54,17,38,,,58.0,0.0,204.0,169,21,4717,143*,31.87,,,10,17,,,63.0,0.0,300.0,279,26,7199,153*,28.45,4996,144.09,7,38,738,274,94.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,50.0,37,1038,884,15.0,2/34,2/34,58.93,5.10,69.2,0,0,0,51.0,23,330,465,18.0,2/24,2/24,25.83,8.45,18.3,0,0,0,144.0,,8264,4862,120,5/65,,40.51,3.53,68.8,1,3,0,204.0,,4752,4231,111,4/12,4/12,38.11,5.34,42.8,3,0,0,300.0,122,1799,2563,79,3/17,3/17,32.44,8.54,22.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Naturally competitive, willing to innovate, capable of changing a game with bat or ball, stunning run-out or implausible catch, he had much in his favour. That feisty approach, whether as a left-arm quick committed to attack or a clean-hitting left-handed batsman, first won him an international cap against Ireland in 2015 as part of an England side determined to adopt a more attacking philosophy after their flop in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. \n', 'Willey, the son of former England allrounder turned umpire Peter Willey, made his debut for Northamptonshire at the start of the 2009 season and struck a half-century on debut. Initially classed as obdurate, like his father, but with a far less unorthodox technique, he spent a few seasons of reconnaissance before his combative style began to attract attention. There had been few grittier, taciturn cricketers than his father and it was clear that that will to win had been passed down, albeit in a more freewheeling and loquacious style.', 'His bowling really developed during the 2012 season when claimed 43 first-class wickets with his brisk swing and seam. The following summer he was central to Northamptonshire\'s Friends Life t20 success with a memorable all-round performance in the final: a 19-ball half-century (the fastest of the season), a direct-hit run-out from the deep and a hat-trick to finish off the match as part of a four-wicket haul, not forgetting a slanging match with Jade Dernbach which he partly credited for his inspirational display. It was enough for his captain, Alex Wakely, to label him ""the Northants Botham.""', 'He had already been named in an England Lions squad and the chat was increasing that full international honours, especially with the white ball, would not be far away. But he had played the final part of 2013 with a sore back and after he pulled out of the England Performance Programme squad, a stress fracture was discovered; surgery on an injured shoulder followed. Talk of an England World Cup berth in Australia and New Zealand in 2015 was abruptly stilled, but the Lions wasted little time in evaluating him in 50-over cricket when he returned for Northants midway through the 2014 season, signalling that his potential was still recognised.', ""His feisty approach first won him an international cap in an experimental England side that met Ireland in Malahide in May 2015 in what turned out to be Peter Moores' last game as England coach. Further ODI and T20I opportunities followed."", ""Willey produced the performance of the 2015 season when he struck a matchwinning century against Sussex at Hove in the NatWest Blast quarter-final, including 34 off an over from the former England slow left-armer Mike Yardy as he fewll only a metre short of hitting six sixes in an over.  He destroyed Birmingham's top order in the semi-final before Lancashire overcame Northants in the final."", ""At the end of the season, he joined Yorkshire in the most headline-grabbing signing of the season, believing that he could advance his long-form game as well as galvanising Yorkshire's less-impressive limited-overs cricket. An outstanding bowling contribution in the World Twenty20 final in Kolkata brought no joy - England were pipped by West Indies in a remarkable final over - although it again emphasised his big-game talents. His switch of counties brought no immediate miracles, however: Yorkshire did reach Finals Day in the NatWest Blast in 2016, but lost in the semi-finals, Willey took only 13 Championship wickets in six matches in his first two seasons and his England limited-overs career became a strange affair as he languished deep in the batting order and rarely completed his allocation of overs; there was no place either in the 2017 Champions Trophy. A career-best 118, from 55 balls, in a T20 victory over Worcestershire at Headingley, the highest T20 score at the time by a Yorkshire batsman, was a glimpse of what the county had invested in.

Yardy, whose worth in the side had been under scrutiny, had combated the illness for much of his career and as the cricket community rallied around him there was general pleasure when he returned to county cricket with Sussex in the early part of the 2011 summer. By the time he was awarded a benefit in 2014, he had spent 15 years at the county, winning seven trophies, including three Championships, and had turned himself in that time from a humdrum county professional by no means certain to make the grade to a highly-respected figure. \n"", 'His farewell season in 2015 coincided with a shock Sussex relegation from Division One of the Champion ship, but as he battled gamely - and ultimately in vain - to keep his side up, the admiration of supporters and opposition was apparent. There was a standing ovation at Hove for a century against the chamnpions Yorkshire, a farewell hundred at Hove against Somerset, and handshakes all round when he resisted again against Yorkshire at Headingley in the final match of the season. His last over in white-ball cricket - in the NatWest Blast quarter-final against Northants at Hove - went less well as David Willey struck 34 off one over and only the fact that one ball fell a yard short at midwicket stopped Yardy conceding six sixes in an over.', 'Yardy first suffered from depression when his professional satisfaction was at its peak, He had been part of the England squad that won the Twenty20 World Cup in the Caribbean in 2010 but later said: ""\'I wasn\'t enjoying life. Everything was a real struggle. I couldn\'t understand why I was in such a bad place because everything seemed to be going quite merrily from the outside. I was a World Cup winner, I was playing for a very successful England team and Sussex were playing really good Twenty20 cricket. Everything I had worked for in my professional life was going well and my family life was great and you are thinking, \'What are you doing? Snap out of it, this is ridiculous.\'""', 'Yardy\'s illness first had a direct impact upon his career when he pulled out of England\'s last one-day international against Pakistan at the Rose Bowl in September 2010. At the end of a fractious series, with revelations about Pakistani spot-fixing in full swing, nobody outside the England set-up bothered to consider why Yardy\'s Sussex team-mate Luke Wright had been preferred. He confided in England\'s coach Andy Flower and sought professional help to alleviate the illness but, like Marcus Trescothick before him, found touring with England exacerbated the problem. He would lie awake until the early hours. In Colombo, his international career - 28 ODIs and 14 T20s - came to an abrupt halt. ""I was out of my comfort zone,"" he said. ""By the last training session I was literally like a zombie.\'', ""He came back too soon and had to leave the pitch midway through a game against Middlesex at Hove, struck by a sense that he was in 'danger' on the field. But he rallied again, proving himself once more to be a dedicated and selfless captain. He relinquished the Sussex captaincy in two formats of the game in July 2013 but he continued to skipper the side in Friends Life t20, leading Sussex to their second finals day in four seasons and was also named the 1st XI Fielder of the Year, with his 34 catches across all formats rivalling numbers taken by wicketkeepers around the county circuit. He could anticipate an enthusiastically-supported benefit in 2014 after 15 years with the county.  In that time he has been the bedrock of the county during the most successful period in their history during which they have won seven trophies including three County Championships."", 'Yardy was never the most elegant player, with bat or ball, but he could be mightily effective.  A compact (stodgy in his early days) left-hander, he cemented his place by recording his maiden first-class century in defeat against Surrey, in the final match of the 2004 season. He began 2005 in identical fashion, with another hundred against Surrey, to trigger a run of form that carried him to the top of the domestic batting charts.', ""His zenith arrived against the Bangladeshis at Hove, where he scored 257 - the highest score by a Sussex batsman against a touring team, beating George Cox jr's 234 against the 1946 Indians - and followed up with a career-best 5 for 83 with his flat, left-arm spin, having started life as a medium-pacer. That was exactly double his previous tally of first-class wickets. It proved to be an effective career move."", ""His good form continued throughout the 2005 season leading to selection for the England A tour of West Indies, and ultimately a chance to push for a World Cup place when he was picked for the Champions Trophy. Though his bowling impressed, England's strange insistence that he bat at No. 4 meant that the overall image suffered, and he was quietly jettisoned. He was groomed as Chris Adams' success at Hove and took the reins in 2009, leading the county to two one-day trophies - the Twenty20 Cup and Pro40 - but also presided over Championship relegation."", 'His steely approach in one-day cricket, however, kept the England selectors interested and when Flower recognised the need for the limited-overs side to find a left-arm spinning allrounder Yardy was recalled for the 2010 World Twenty20. Darting the ball in, he formed a potent spin partnership with Graeme Swann that helped England achieve their first ever success in a global ICC event. That secured him a regular place during the 2010 season and then a berth at the World Cup where his problems were to mount once more.', '\n']",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,28.0,24,8,326.0,60*,20.37,472,69.06,0,2,20,1,10.0,0.0,14.0,8,5,96.0,35*,32.00,72,133.33,0,0,9,1,8.0,0.0,193.0,320,27,10693,257,36.49,,,23,50,,,184,0,209.0,178,31,3677,98*,25.01,,,0,23,,,75.0,0.0,126.0,94,33,1250,76*,20.49,1214,102.96,0,2,104,12,39.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,28.0,28,1332,1075,21.0,3/24,3/24,51.19,4.84,63.4,0,0,0,14.0,13,276,299,11.0,2/19,2/19,27.18,6.5,25.0,0,0,0,193.0,,3675,2192,29,5/83,,75.58,3.57,126.7,,1,0,209.0,,6408,5474,141,6/27,6/27,38.82,5.12,45.4,3,1,0,126.0,112,2397,2710,100,3/21,3/21,27.10,6.78,23.9,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

After an accomplished career as a tight and testing white-ball operator, he suffered a series of serious knee injuries and, despite coming back for New South Wales, was cut from Australia's contract list in April. He vowed to continue fighting. \n"", ""Tall and slim, Bracken moves the ball both ways in the air and off the seam and fitted easily into Australia's rampant one-day squad in 2000-01. He was also instrumental in resuscitating New South Wales' fortunes, including a first-innings 6 for 27 in their 2004-05 final win over Queensland and 7 for 4 earlier that season when South Australia fell for 29. A shoulder injury cut short his maiden Ashes tour in 2001 after two matches, but following a spell on the sidelines he returned to the national set-up during the 2003 World Cup, when Jason Gillespie dropped out with a heel injury. "", ""His Test debut finally came in 2003-04, but in three outings against the powerful Indian batting line-up he failed to make real inroads. In 2004 he was omitted from Cricket Australia's list of contracted players, but returned to the ODI scene for the 2005 Super Series and became a regular in green and gold. Work in the nets refining his swing was rewarded with two Tests in 2005-06 and he also added another string by delivering across the seam when he wanted to defend. "", 'The versatility and control led to 46 ODI wickets for 2006, the second most in the world, and at times during the 2006 Champions Trophy he opened the attack, dropping Glenn McGrath to first change. In 17 matches between the South Africa tour and the end of the CB Series he picked up at least a wicket in each game and he missed only one match at the World Cup, capturing 16 victims in his second campaign. ', 'His steady rise peaked after the 2008 West Indies tour when he became the No. 1-ranked one-day bowler, his 34 wickets in the previous home contest boosting his ratings. The West Indies series was also an important step following what could have been a career-ending knee injury. He required surgery and when the doctor scraped away the cartilage it was like ""old paint peeling off a wall"".

It dropped a little when he encountered Test bowlers (with 8 v Bangladesh in Glasgow).

At his peak Clarke was ranked the best Test batsman in the world, testament not only to his skill but his hard work in overcoming a chronic back injury that caused him progressively more trouble as his career advanced. Also an intuitive, aggressive captain, Clarke took over from Ricky Ponting in 2011 and while the team did not always run harmoniously during his tenure, he was at the helm for an Ashes whitewash in 2013-14 and a World Cup triumph in 2015. His retirement came at the end of a lost Ashes campaign in England in 2015, but he could be satisfied with a career punctuated by fine achievements. \n"", ""As a young man Clarke could do anything with the bat, but he matured into one of the game's most professional, reliable and focussed players. A year into his Test career he learnt that he had to shed the flourishes that made him a golden child in order to shine consistently at elite level. Breathtaking centuries on debut away and at home stamped him as a shot-maker to savour, but his method in later years was to find gaps by caressing the ball along the ground. In the field his throw was as fast and accurate as anything in the game, and he could winkle out batsmen with his disarming left-arm spin. "", 'Mostly he became known for his immaculate driving and slicing of the ball through impossible angles. His peak year was 2012, which brought 1595 runs at 106.33 and stamped him as the most in-form batsman in the world. The year began with a monumental 329 not out against India at the SCG and continued with 210 in Adelaide, where he joined Wally Hammond and Don Bradman as the only men to score a triple-century and a double-hundred in the same series. Later in the year came back-to-back double-centuries against South Africa in Brisbane and Adelaide. There seemed little he could not do.', ""But the team harmony disintegrated on the tour of India that followed in 2013, when Clarke and coach Mickey Arthur suspended four players in what became known as the homework saga. The Ashes series in England was then lost, but Clarke's Australians regained the urn with a 5-0 clean sweep in Australia at the end of the year. Clarke's gutsy century in Cape Town in 2014, completed with a broken shoulder thanks to a bouncer barrage from Morne Morkel, led to Australia's return to No.1, if only temporarily. Later in the year a statesmanlike Clarke led the country in mourning the death of his close friend Phillip Hughes, and an emotional century in Adelaide followed in what Clarke called the most important match of his career."", ""Although Clarke's ability and dedication could never be questioned, he nevertheless struggled at times to win over sections of the public, due in part to his A-list celebrity status, large endorsements and high-profile private life. There were occasions when he was booed in his own country, and at times he was accused of being too aloof around the team environment. But whatever his off-field status, Clarke will be remembered as a batsman of class and a captain who took the game on, and emerged with an enviable record in both spheres.\n"", '\n']","['Allan Border Medal - 2005, 2009, 2012, 2013', 'Australian Test Player of the Year - 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014', 'ICC Cricketer of the Year 2013', 'ICC Test Player of the Year 2013']",115.0,198,22,8643.0,329*,49.1,15456,55.92,28,27,978,39,134,0,245.0,223,44,7981.0,130,44.58,10104,78.98,8,58,665,53,106.0,0.0,34.0,28,5,488.0,67,21.21,473,103.17,0,1,29,10,13.0,0.0,188.0,327,33,13826,329*,47.02,,,45,48,,,203,0,313.0,285,52,9905,130,42.51,12582,78.72,9,73,,,132.0,0.0,46.0,40,5,737,67,21.05,681,108.22,0,1,57,12,18.0,0.0,115.0,65,2435,1184,31.0,6/9,6/9,38.19,2.91,78.5,0,2,0,245.0,106,2585,2146,57.0,5/35,5/35,37.64,4.98,45.3,1,1,0,34.0,15,156,225,6.0,1/2,1/2,37.50,8.65,26.0,0,0,0,188.0,,3627,1886,42,6/9,,44.90,3.11,86.3,,2,0,313.0,,3295,2689,84,5/35,5/35,32.01,4.89,39.2,1,1,0,46.0,24,273,368,9,1/2,1/2,40.88,8.08,30.3,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

These struggles led the adaptable Carey to make another switch, from full-time batsman to wicketkeeper batting down the order, and it was in this form that he was able to progress.

The following year, Finch was named Australia's T20 captain to replace George Bailey, but on the eve of the 2016 World T20 in India the selectors decided to consolidate the captaincy of all three formats and handed the job to Steven Smith. Finch at the time was the No.1-ranked T20 international batsman in the world, but found himself suddenly struggling to hold on to his place in the side. For some time Finch had been an automatic selection in Australia's ODI and T20 teams, and had set the tone for their triumphant 2015 World Cup with 135 in their opening match against England at the MCG. \n"", 'Move forward three years, amid a meltdown in Australian cricket centered around the ball-tampering scandal at Newlands, and Finch found himself installed as the national white-ball captain and with Test caps to his name. Although Finch has been a dominating figure as an opener in the shorter formats, he struggled to find his place in first-class cricket. Victoria did not always view Finch as being in their preferred Sheffield Shield batting order, and nearly three years came between his second and third first-class centuries from 2011 to 2014. He piled on an unbeaten 288 against New Zealand in a tour match in Blacktown in 2015-16, although that match was ultimately abandoned as the New Zealanders complained about the condition of the pitch.', ""Finch remained an in-demand T20 cricketer and in 2016 joined the Gujarat Lions, his sixth IPL franchise. After a lean run in ODIs around the 2016 Champions Trophy, which threatened his place, he then went on a run of four centuries (three against England) in 10 matches to firm himself as one of Australia's key one-day batsman. His first two Tests showed some promise, but that remained a work in progress."", '\n']","['Australian Twenty20 International Player of the Year - 2014', 'ICC Twenty20 International Performance of the Year 2014']",5.0,10,0,278.0,62,27.8,618,44.98,0,2,30,1,7,0,105.0,101,1,3717.0,148,37.17,4206,88.37,12,19,383,84,52.0,0.0,52.0,52,7,1671.0,172,37.13,1072,155.87,2,9,161,79,23.0,0.0,83.0,139,6,4721,288*,35.49,7689,61.39,7,31,540,68,78,0,184.0,180,6,6606,154,37.96,7524,87.79,16,39,654,160,79.0,0.0,253.0,248,27,7835,172,35.45,5498,142.50,6,53,765,321,111.0,0.0,5.0,1,12,8,0.0,-,-,35.33,4.00,-,0,0,0,105.0,15,176,159,2.0,1/2,1/2,79.5,5.42,88.0,0,0,0,52.0,2,12,27,0.0,-,-,-,13.5,-,0,0,0,83.0,28,464,318,5,1/0,1/0,63.60,4.11,92.8,0,0,0,184.0,25,371,340,7,2/44,2/44,48.57,5.49,53.0,0,0,0,253.0,25,221,340,7,1/9,1/9,48.57,9.23,31.5,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Also like Michael, Hussey has been forced to pile up mountains of runs in Australia before gaining the confidence of the national selectors. It took his first 1000-run season in 2007-08 before he was finally chosen for a tour, the ODI series in the West Indies in 2008, and earned his first Cricket Australia contract. Earlier in that summer he made his Twenty20 international debut against India at the MCG. Hussey was one of the big surprises in the Indian Premier League auction when Kolkata paid $625,000 to secure him - far more than the sums offered for his brother and Ricky Ponting. Over the next couple of years he was a regular in Australia's Twenty20 team and a fringe ODI player. In 2009-10, Hussey topped the Sheffield Shield run tally with 970 at 57.05, including 168 in the final as he helped Victoria raise the trophy with victory over Queensland. But within a month Hussey had lost his CA contract as the selectors looked to younger men. \n"", ""Despite his crash-and-bash style, Hussey is desperate not to be pigeon-holed as a Twenty20 player, although that appears to be where his international future lies. Still, he has been a standout first-class player in county cricket and for Victoria; only Simon Katich made more runs than him in the 2007-08 Sheffield Shield campaign. He only made two centuries and his best was 104 but his consistency was remarkable. Equally impressive was his 484 FR Cup runs at 44, including a 60-ball century - the second-fastest in Australia's domestic one-day history - that featured eight sixes. It was no surprise when Hussey was named Victoria's Player of the Year in all three formats. He had come off a prolific season at Nottinghamshire, where he made 1219 runs at 93.76, including 275 from 227 balls against Essex. The next summer he struggled in the Sheffield Shield before making an important century in the final win, and he held on to his national contract. That was soon followed by a brutal 88 from 44 balls in a Twenty20 international in Johannesburg, and his maiden ODI century came against Scotland in August 2009. "", 'An aggressive batsman with a strong bottom-hand technique, Hussey hit a breathtaking, breakthrough 212 not out at nearly a run a ball in 2003-04, which was his first full-time season at first-class level. The innings came as Victoria chased a record-breaking 455 for a Pura Cup victory in Newcastle and Steve Waugh, the opposing captain, was impressed. The summer ended with 857 runs at 61 and was quickly followed by 1208 county runs in 2004. Repeating the local haul was difficult and despite starring for Australia A in one-day games - he hit a century against West Indies and a fifty against Pakistan - he was unable to hold his Pura Cup spot. The unhappy Hussey wanted a release to return to Western Australia, where he had played under-19 and 2nd XI games, but Cricket Victoria insisted he stay. Arriving in Nottingham he immediately fixed a minor technical problem and went on to gorge 1231 runs with a high of 232 not out as the county won the Championship. Another solid effort at Nottinghamshire in 2006 - he made 1103 runs at 50.13 - preceded his state-topping 911 Pura Cup runs at 53.58 in 2006-07, when he scored centuries in three consecutive matches.

His cool head under pressure has won matches for Australia many times, and notably he was Man of the Match in the 2015 World Cup final triumph over New Zealand. On that occasion it was his bowling that earned him the honour, his 3 for 36 restricting New Zealand to a very gettable 183. His variations - slow balls and cutters especially - make him a dangerous bowler in the short forms and against Pakistan at the 2016 World T20 he became the first Australian to take a five-wicket haul in a T20 international. Faulkner made his Test debut in the dead rubber at The Oval on the 2013 Ashes tour and claimed six wickets, but has struggled to squeeze back into the side since then. Later that year he plundered his first ODI century - 116 off 73 balls - in a loss to India in Bangalore, in a game that will be more remembered for Rohit Sharma's 209. At domestic level, Faulkner was Tasmania's best player during a period of great success for the state. His breakout season in 2010-11 - he collected 36 Sheffield Shield wickets at 17.72 - coincided with the Tigers winning the Shield for the second time. The following two summers brought the consistent Faulkner wicket tallies of 36 and 39 and he helped the Tigers reach the Shield final in 2011-12 and win it in 2012-13 - he was Man of the Match in that final. His importance for Tasmania during those three seasons cannot be underestimated and in 2012-13 he won his third consecutive Ricky Ponting Medal as Tasmania's best player. Faulkner, whose father Peter also played for Tasmania, signed with his fourth IPL team - Gujarat Lions - for the 2016 season.

He announced himself to the world with a stupendous flipper to Zimbabwe's Andy Flower in the 2003 World Cup. Flower leapt back, waited for the away-spin and then slumped, hideously bamboozled, as the ball fizzed straight through on to his stumps. Until that moment, Hogg's cricketing trajectory had been anything but straightforward. Like Stuart MacGill, he had spent years in the shadow of Shane Warne. He went to that World Cup hoping to pick Warne's brain, and unexpectedly found himself filling Warne's boots. His initial Test opportunity, at Delhi way back in 1996, also arose as Warne's stand-in. He made 1 and 4, took 1 for 69, and was promptly dumped for the next seven years and 78 games. No other Australian has waited so long between his first and second Tests; Alan Hurst, dropped for 30 matches, was the previous record-holder.  \n"", 'During his time in the wilderness, Hogg learned to practise less and enjoy himself more. He began first-class life as a solid left-hand batsman, before flirting with chinamen in the nets one afternoon at the playful suggestion of his Western Australia coach Tony Mann. His batting has fallen away, although he hit a Pura Cup century in 2004-05, but his jack-in-a-box fielding makes up for it. Hogg used to be a postman - ""I do my round like a Formula One driver,"" he once bragged - and has the ever-present smile of a postie who\'s never known yappy dogs or rainy days. ', ""Claiming the Man-of-the-Series award against Bangladesh, Hogg passed 100 ODI wickets in April 2006, but was used strangely at home the following season after playing in the final of the Champions Trophy. Called on only once during the CB Series preliminary rounds, he was even released for domestic matches and seemed to be on the verge of exiting the national set-up. Cameron White's disappointing bowling turned the selectors back to Hogg, who then failed to get a wicket in the next five games. However, instead of being a World Cup passenger, he suddenly headed for the cockpit for an incredible journey. Batsmen found choosing a Caribbean bar easier than picking Hogg's tricky menu and he created as much destruction as Murali. Twenty-one wickets at 15.80 sparked many more smiles but he again struggled when given chances in the Test series against India, his eight wickets costing almost 60 apiece. Nevertheless, his decision to retire at the end of the 2007-08 summer caught many on the hop."", 'His decision to come back was just as surprising. After a brief stint as a commentator, he returned to play grade cricket in Perth.

When he was dropped with an average of 58.42 only five matches into his Test career in 2005-06, he vowed to win back his place. He added only one Test, as a fill-in during a tour of the West Indies two years later, before his tally was permanently stalled at six matches in the baggy green. It was not an adequate reward for one of the most prolific run scorers in the modern era of Australia's domestic game. \n"", ""By the time the 2009-10 season arrived, Hodge's heart was no longer in first-class cricket. He began the summer with 195 against South Australia but had an epiphany when he had reached his century, stumps was near and he launched the new ball over the bowler's head for six. Hodge said it signified he no longer had the drive to play the longer format and he soon retired, although he announced he would stay on in Victoria's limited-overs teams for another two seasons. And why not? He comfortably topped the FR Cup tally in 2009-10 with 622 runs at 69.11, including four centuries, and remained one of the world's best Twenty20 batsmen."", ""In 2006-07 he had forced his way into the ODI side when Ricky Ponting rested, and a 97 and 99 not out won him a place in the World Cup squad. In the Caribbean, he finally reached three figures with 123 off 89 balls against the Netherlands, but it was his last bat in the tournament and he watched the final from the dressing room. It had become an all-too familiar viewing platform. Hodge was Australia's unluckiest casualty of the 2005-06 season of batting change. Picked for his first Test in November after being the reserve on tours to India, New Zealand and England, he opened with a fluent 60 and by the end of the home summer had 409 runs at an envious average."", 'Still it wasn\'t enough to earn a spot on the South Africa trip as the selectors returned to Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke. Included in his five outings was an unbeaten 203 against South Africa in Perth, where he joined his boyhood idol Dean Jones as one of five Australians to make their maiden century a double. Two Tests later, Hodge, a tiny right-hander who is more quiet and laid back than Jones, was dropped amid whispers of a technical flaw against fast bowling, a short drought in the Pura Cup and a selection ""judgment call"". He picked himself up with a century in the domestic final loss to Queensland but remained on the fringes of the national side, making occasional one-day and Twenty20 appearances. He held on to his Cricket Australia contract until 2009-10, but was never viewed by the selectors as anything but a back-up plan. ', ""A regular and consistent performer for his state and counties, Hodge's Victorian debut came in 1993-94 as an 18-year-old and he almost compiled 1000 runs in the season as he settled quickly at No. 4. The following years were more difficult, but he returned from the dips as a more complete player, carrying a classical technique and the ability to direct shots to all parts of the ground. Around consistently impressive one-day returns, Hodge passed the 1000 barrier in the 2000-01 first-class summer when he was a key player in the Bushrangers' march to a second successive Pura Cup final. More of the same output was revealed in 2001-02, when he shared the domestic Player-of-the-Season award with Queensland's Jimmy Maher, and his consistency pushed him towards international honours. "", ""After a brief spell with Durham in 2002, Hodge spent two productive summers at Leicestershire, leading them to a domestic one-day trophy in 2004 and making the county's highest individual score of 302 not out against Nottinghamshire the season before, but moved to Lancashire in 2005. Rewarded with his first Cricket Australia contract in 2004, he was picked for the India tour and considered for the opening Test, but narrowly missed a place taken spectacularly by Clarke."", ' August 2010']",[],6.0,11,2,503.0,203*,55.88,965,52.12,1,2,60,1,9,0,25.0,21,2,575.0,123,30.26,657,87.51,1,3,51,12,16.0,0.0,15.0,11,4,183.0,36,26.14,144,127.08,0,0,9,7,5.0,0.0,223.0,388,38,17084,302*,48.81,,,51,64,,,127,0,251.0,241,30,9127,164,43.25,,,29,38,,,93.0,0.0,277.0,261,60,7406,106,36.84,5641,131.28,2,48,709,248,102.0,0.0,6.0,1,12,8,0.0,-,-,35.33,4.00,-,0,0,0,25.0,3,66,51,1.0,1/17,1/17,51.0,4.63,66.0,0,0,0,15.0,3,30,43,1.0,1/13,1/13,43.00,8.6,30.0,0,0,0,223.0,,5583,3086,74,4/17,,41.70,3.31,75.4,,0,0,251.0,,1734,1554,40,5/28,5/28,38.85,5.37,43.3,0,1,0,277.0,86,1116,1451,65,4/13,4/13,22.32,7.80,17.1,3,0,0,False,False,False,False

He was simultaneously a cheerful throwback to more innocent times, a flap-eared country boy who walked when given not out in a World Cup semi-final, and swatted his second ball for six while sitting on a Test pair. ""Just hit the ball,"" is how he once described his philosophy on batting, and he seldom strayed from it. Employing a high-on-the-handle grip, he poked good balls into gaps and throttled most others, invariably with head straight, wrists soft and balance sublime. Only at the death did he jettison the textbook, whirling his bat like a hammer-thrower, caring only for the scoreboard and never his average. Still he managed to score at a tempo - 81 per 100 balls in Tests, 96 in one-dayers - that made Viv Richards and Gilbert Jessop look like stick-in-the-muds.  \n', ""When he signed a record A$2m sponsorship deal with Puma in 2004, few people questioned his value for money. Indeed it was arguably Gilchrist's belated Test arrival that turned the Australian XI from powerful to overpowering. He bludgeoned 81 on debut, pouched five catches and a stumping, and barely paused for breath until stepping down in 2008. Only in the closing stages of an untouchable career did his appetite slow - he was troubled by Andrew Flintoff's around-the-wicket angle during 2005 and found the flaw difficult to overcome - and his match-turning 144 against Bangladesh in April 2006 was his first century in 16 Tests. "", ""The 2006-07 Ashes series was literally hit and miss, with three single-figure scores, two fifties and his most brutal hundred. At home his one-day form was subdued, but the game's biggest competition - and it's most important match - brought out Gilchrist's highest standards. He stole the World Cup final from Sri Lanka with 149 off 104 balls, slamming 13 fours and eight sixes, and added to his 54 and 57 from his previous two global triumphs. Using a tip from his batting coach Bob Meuleman, he put a squash ball in his glove to allow him to hit straighter - the advice should have been patented instantly. "", ""In Tests, three Gilchrist innings rank among the most amazing by Australians: his death-defying unbeaten 149 against Pakistan at Hobart when all seemed lost, his savage and emotional 204 not out against South Africa at Johannesburg, and his 57-delivery Ashes century at Perth when he missed equalling Richards' world mark by a ball. In one-dayers, his 172 is the third-highest score by an Australian and his 472 dismissals might take decades to top. "", ""As Australia's 41st Test captain he found the extra burden tiring, and was happy for Ricky Ponting to step in once Steve Waugh retired. But as Ponting's fill-in he crossed the final frontier, leading Australia to their first series win in India for 35 years in 2004-05. As a wicketkeeper he lacked Rod Marsh's acrobatics and Ian Healy's finesse, and he probably peaked at 30 in 2002. But if he clutched few screamers he dropped even fewer sitters, although one easy offering in Adelaide convinced him it was time to go. During that match against India he briefly became the leading gloveman in Test cricket by overtaking Mark Boucher, then the following day announced his retirement from all cricket but the Indian Premier League."", ' \n', ' September 2008']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year - 2002', 'One-Day International Player of the Year - 2003', 'One-Day International Player of the Year - 2004', 'Walter Lawrence Trophy 2010']",96.0,137,20,5570.0,204*,47.6,6796,81.95,17,26,677,100,379,37,287.0,279,11,9619.0,172,35.89,9922,96.94,16,55,1162,149,417.0,55.0,13.0,13,1,272.0,48,22.66,192,141.66,0,0,27,13,17.0,0.0,190.0,280,46,10334,204*,44.16,,,30,43,,,756,55,356.0,343,19,11326,172,34.95,,,18,63,,,526.0,65.0,102.0,102,5,2622,109*,27.03,1869,140.28,3,13,296,120,74.0,22.0,96.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,287.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,13.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,190.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,356.0,,12,10,0,-,-,-,5.00,-,0,0,0,102.0,1,1,0,1,1/0,1/0,0.00,0.00,1.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

His 493 runs at 61.62 put him second only to David Warner on the run tally and he was nimble behind the stumps, and it was only Mitchell Johnson's reign of terror that prevented Haddin being Player of the Series. \n"", ""By 2014, he was again Australia's preferred keeper in all three formats after two years earlier being usurped by Matthew Wade in all three. Haddin had originally lost his Test spot to Wade after flying home from the 2012 West Indies tour when his 17-month-old daughter Mia was diagnosed with cancer. At 34, it seemed as though his international career might be over, but Haddin showed his dedication by returning to domestic cricket and winning back his place for the 2013 Ashes tour, when Australia's selectors wanted his experience and poise. Renowned as a loyal team man who could be brusque with the media, Haddin was a valuable lieutenant and sounding board for Clarke during the back-to-back Ashes series."", ""Haddin's first taste of Test cricket had come in the West Indies in 2008, when he played through the pain of a broken finger. Flaws in his keeping were on show in India in 2008 but his glovework gradually improved, and a batting breakthrough in 2008-09 gave him confidence. In his 16th Test innings he passed 50 for the first time and went on to 169 against New Zealand in Adelaide, showing flashes Gilchrist would have accepted. An important one-day batsman who shuffled around the order, Haddin also had the chance to captain Australia in T20s in 2009 when Ricky Ponting, Clarke and Michael Hussey were rested. He was also starting to prove himself a productive Test run-maker, which continued on the 2009 Ashes tour with 121 in Cardiff and 80 at Lord's, where he also gave up 20 byes as he struggled to deal with the late movement. A broken finger gave Graham Manou an opening at Edgbaston, but Haddin returned for the final two Tests. "", ""He remained a useful batting contributor in 2009-10 but his highlight was the spectacular, one-handed take at full stretch down the legside off Salman Butt. It was a hugely impressive catch that helped Australia to an unbelievable win at the SCG in 2009-10. (New Zealand supporters find it hard to forget the glove-assisted bowled of Neil Broom in a one-day game the previous summer.) Another injury, a batting-related elbow problem, rubbed him out of the Pakistan series in England, where Tim Paine was used, and after 136 in the opening Ashes Test of 2010-11, Haddin endured a more difficult period in 2011. Notably, he was one of the major culprits in Australia's 47 all out in Cape Town, when at 18 for 5 he backed away and tried to drive Vernon Philander on the up through the off side, gifting South Africa a sixth wicket. A lean home series against India followed, before Wade took his place in the West Indies."", 'A valuable presence in the limited-overs sides, Haddin has scored ODI centuries opening the batting. He is a clean, effortless hitter and his lofted straight drive is among the best shots in the game. He made his ODI debut in 2001 but had to see off the likes of Darren Berry, Wade Seccombe and Ryan Campbell to become keeper-in-waiting behind Gilchrist. A former Australia Under-19 captain who grew up in Gundagai, Haddin began his domestic career in 1997-98 with the ACT Comets in their debut Mercantile Mutual Cup season. Two years later he was playing for New South Wales, and played in their successful Pura Cup/Sheffield Shield finals of 2002-03 and 2007-08, and captained them to the title in 2004-05.\n']",[],66.0,112,13,3266.0,169,32.98,5587,58.45,4,18,363,54,262,8,126.0,115,16,3122.0,110,31.53,3706,84.24,2,16,296,71,170.0,11.0,34.0,29,6,402.0,47,17.47,351,114.52,0,0,30,13,17.0,6.0,184.0,300,39,9932,169,38.05,,,17,56,,,608,40,235.0,221,24,6503,138*,33.01,,,9,35,,,318.0,50.0,97.0,91,13,1747,76,22.39,1384,126.22,0,10,144,67,61.0,20.0,66.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,126.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,34.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,184.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,235.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,97.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

That summit came during 2013-14, when in successive series he cowed the batsmen of England and South Africa with his speed and aggression. In those eight Tests he collected 59 wickets at 15.23, along with a big bunch of cherries on helmets and gloves. Not surprisingly it led to Johnson winning his first Allan Border Medal, and at the age of 32 he was finally achieving the sorts of feats that Dennis Lillee might have expected when he first spotted Johnson's talent as a 17-year-old. There had been other highlights along the way for Johnson, including brutal spells against South Africa in 2008-09, but the lows of his 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes campaigns left his legacy looking uncertain. Nerves and family problems contributed to those struggles, but a broken toe in 2011 gave him time away from the game and the chance to reflect on where he was going. \n"", ""It was still far from smooth sailing: he offered little on the 2013 tour of India and was not even picked for the 2013 Ashes in England, but his return for the home Ashes that followed was emphatic. Wearing a moustache reminiscent of Lillee, he delivered a series of fast-bowling spells that would not have been out of place in the Lillee-Thomson era. Johnson intimidated with his bouncer and made England's batsmen seriously uncomfortable; that he was Player of the Series was no surprise. As described by "", ', the mood changed whenever he tore in: ""This was something visceral: a hush followed by a crescendo"". A 12-wicket Test in Centurion in Australia\'s next series showed that it was no fluke. After that South African tour Johnson\'s pace eased off again, but he remained a strike weapon and became the fifth Australian bowler to take 300 wickets in Tests.  ', ""An athlete who started out preferring tennis, Johnson was late to focus on cricket and suffered early in his career with four back stress fractures that almost floored him for good. He persevered, driving a plumbing van when he lost his Queensland contract, and made his Test debut in 2007 after the retirement of Glenn McGrath. With a strong, flowing run to the crease, Johnson can become mechanical in delivery, especially if his wrist, a long-term concern, is in the wrong position. When it's bad, he sprays the ball on both sides of the wicket like an old-fashioned firebrand. When it's perfect, there are few better bowlers in the game. The late swing at pace is a major problem, along with sharp bounce, and sometimes it's just the angle across the batsmen that undoes them. Off the field he is often so quiet that it is hard to reconcile with his on-field speed and aggression. Also a clean striker with the bat, Johnson scored a Test century in South Africa in 2009, but never quite reached the genuine all-round status that once seemed possible.\n"", '\n']","['ICC Cricketer of the Year 2009', 'Allan Border Medal - 2014', 'ICC Cricketer of the Year 2014', 'ICC Test Player of the Year 2014']",73.0,109,16,2065.0,123*,22.2,3536,58.39,1,11,247,31,27.0,0.0,153.0,91,32,951.0,73*,16.11,987,96.35,0,2,81,23,35.0,0.0,30.0,17,7,109.0,28*,10.90,95,114.73,0,0,8,3,5.0,0.0,117.0,170,31,3180,123*,22.87,,,2,15,,,39.0,0.0,184.0,108,39,1115,73*,16.15,1223,91.16,0,2,,,39.0,0.0,112.0,52,27,320,30,12.80,304,105.26,0,0,23,10,28.0,0.0,73.0,140,16001,8891,313.0,8/61,12/127,28.4,3.33,51.1,16,12,3,153.0,150,7489,6038,239.0,6/31,6/31,25.26,4.83,31.3,9,3,0,30.0,30,656,797,38.0,3/15,3/15,20.97,7.28,17.2,0,0,0,117.0,,23765,13352,465,8/61,,28.71,3.37,51.1,24,17,4,184.0,,9227,7387,284,6/31,6/31,26.01,4.80,32.4,11,4,0,112.0,111,2494,3172,123,3/3,3/3,25.78,7.63,20.2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments.

It was also during early 2015 that Maxwell broke into the top 10 of the ICC one-day international batting rankings, which highlighted his improved consistency."", 'Australia have also used Maxwell in Tests but to less effect - patience at the crease has not generally been one of his strengths. However, in Delhi in 2013 he had the distinction of opening the batting and bowling in the same Test, as Australia searched in vain for something to turn their disastrous series around. He scored a maiden Test century against India in 2017 but could not find a space in a new-look Australia side post the ball-tampering scandal.

The international grounding and a backyard net helped develop Marsh into one of the finest young run-makers in the country. It also gave him a taste of what he could expect when he joined the national team. He made a successful start to his ODI career in 2008 and then scored a superb century on Test debut in Sri Lanka in 2011. Marsh looked set for a lengthy tenure as Australia's No.3 but a back injury suffered during Australia's disastrous Cape Town Test later that year proved a serious setback. Marsh rejoined the side for the home Tests against India but was a shadow of himself, and 17 runs from six innings was a calamitous return. He was recalled for the 2014 tour of South Africa and scored 148 in Centurion, but was dropped again after making a pair in the next Test.  Another recall came at home against India when Michael Clarke was injured, and 99 at the MCG suggested he still had something to offer.  \n"", 'But in his only Test on the 2015 Ashes tour he scored 0 and 2, and it seemed that might have been his last chance. Until he was given another, included to replace the injured Usman Khawaja for the inaugural day-night Test against New Zealand in 2015-16. Permanency has never arrived, however, through a mixture of form and injury. It felt as though the 2017-18 Ashes promised something better with two hundreds in the series, including one against the pink ball in Adelaide, but there was a subsequent slump in form that again brought the spotlight on his position.', 'Marsh has appealed to a series of Australian selection panels, who have viewed him as a viable top-order prospect in Tests and ODIs especially. His first-class record may be underwhelming for a man given so many chances and his penchant for nicking off early has proved a frustration, but he has also shown himself to be capable of scoring hundreds at the highest level. More gifted than his father - ""He\'s got a few more shots than me,"" Geoff once said - Marsh is a left-hander who impressed the tough judges of Steve and Mark Waugh while scoring his maiden first-class century in 2003. The milestone arrived with two sixes in a row over midwicket off Mark Waugh\'s offspin and a rash of compliments. ""It\'s a pretty good feeling when the Australia captain comes up to you and says \'well done, mate\',"" Marsh said.

Fast and with a flashy smile that added to his star quality, he finished as Australia's fourth-most successful bowler with 310 wickets in 76 matches. A refusal to bow to severe injuries increases his rating, but for most of his career he operated as brutal support for Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie. In his final two years he was a highly dependable attack leader until his body limited his ability to back up in five-day contests. \n"", 'At his best he gained outswing with the new ball and reverse with the older one, making him even more difficult for batsmen trying to steady themselves while knowing he could reach 160kph. The charging run-up and leaping celebrations added to the theatre for a bowler who made an instant impact when taking five wickets on debut at the MCG. Forty-two victims came in his opening seven Tests to gain him an A-list reputation, but he was soon in rehabilitation after an elbow operation. His ankles were a popular site for surgery and there were also side strains and stress fractures in a familiar cycle of breath-taking pace, painful injury and long-term layoff.', ""After starting by shaking up batsmen with short balls and yorkers, Lee became a smarter operator under Ricky Ponting's captaincy and knew when to deliver a burst of speed or a containing spell. In nine Tests following McGrath's departure, Lee stood up with 58 victims at 21.55 and also won the Allan Border Medal in 2008. During that period he helped keep the rebuilding side on top of the world. "", ""Life soon became harder again and after returning from more ankle surgery - his last act in a Test was limping off the MCG with a broken foot - he missed the 2009 Ashes with a side strain. England wasn't a kind host for Lee, who was consoled by Andrew Flintoff during his absorbing yet heart-breaking batting near-miss in Edgbaston in 2005. He was a courageous run-maker who would deflect or absorb the efforts of opposing fast men as they searched for payback."", 'A gentleman off the field, he was aggressive on it and rarely went over the top in comparison to his team-mates, although his bouncers at the tail-enders were uncomfortable viewing. Mostly he was a shining example to young players in all forms of the game. He retired from Tests at the beginning of 2010 to prolong his career in the shorter forms: in those affairs he could stay true to himself by attempting to operate at optimum speed while reducing the load on his aching body.

He used to play a couple of club games at the start of the season, a handful at the end, and in between travel the world pursuing his other passion, skiing. He was no run-of-the-mill ski bum - he competed for several years in World Cup skiing events and narrowly missed selection for the Australian Winter Olympics team in the late 1990s. But when he started to take his cricket seriously, he quickly grabbed the attention of Victoria\'s selectors. It led to a first-class debut at 29 in 2005-06, and in his second game he suffered the group humiliation of watching Queensland storm to 6 for 900 declared in the Pura Cup final. \n', ""A persistent shoulder injury picked up during a stint in English club cricket limited him to one match the following summer, but in 2007-08 Nannes enjoyed his most productive season. A genuinely quick left-arm bowler who can swing the ball late, Nannes collected 22 Pura Cup wickets at 28.54, although he was again part of a demoralised, unsuccessful Victoria side in the decider. There was more joy in the Twenty20, where he was instrumental in the Bushrangers winning the title. Nannes destroyed Western Australia with 4 for 23 in the final, and his promising FR Cup season - 11 wickets at 20.54 - hinted that he would be a big part of Victoria's attack moving forward. "", ""Nannes was Middlesex's spearhead when they won the domestic Twenty20 cup in 2008, and with his stock as a limited-overs bowler rising with every game, he was signed by the Delhi Daredevils before the 2009 edition of the IPL - and chose his franchise over Victoria, his state side, when both teams made it to the Champions League that year. "", ""Nannes gave up hope of playing for Australia after being overlooked for the World Twenty20 in England in 2009. Instead, he turned out for Netherlands (he is the son of Dutch migrant parents and carries a Dutch passport) and was part of the side that shocked England in the tournament opener. Though he went wicketless in that game, he was soon on Australia's radar, making his debut in an ODI against Scotland at Edinburgh. Quickly establishing himself as one of Twenty20 cricket's leading bowlers in the international arena, Nannes was the leading wicket-taker at the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean in May 2010, picking up 14 scalps at 13.07. "", 'Despite picking up 93 wickets at a shade over 25 in less than three years of first-class cricket, Nannes decided to retire from the longer forms of the game in February 2010 and become a limited-overs specialist - a route that is becoming increasingly more common for fast bowlers.

There is no doubt about his greatness after taking guard, but his leadership has been under scrutiny for much of his reign.

He stepped down from the captaincy when that run ended, in the 2011 World Cup. For the first three years of his reign he was in charge of a superstar unit and did not have to decide much tactically, but once that group headed for retirement he had to change from a manager to moulder. "", ""As a batsman the only debate is where to rank him in the high reaches of the game's greatest run-makers. Acclaimed by Academy coach Rod Marsh as the best teenage batsman he had ever seen, Ponting began with Tasmania at 17 and Australia at 20, and was given out unluckily for 96 on his Test debut. There were some teething problems, including a public admission of an alcohol problem, but the longer he went on the more he matured, building up records and runs.

Considered a genuine all-round prospect right from the start, Perry's stellar rise has seen her take on the role of pace spearhead in the Australian bowling attack. \n"", 'Australia had been looking for a replacement for fast bowler Cathryn Fitzpatrick, who retired in March 2007, and Perry settled into the role. For a time, that was uncertain, as she also had the alluring prospect of a long-term career in soccer, and was representing the Matildas when the call-up to the national cricket team came. Her future in cricket had been secured when she was in the group of the first women cricketers to be handed contracts by Cricket Australia in 2008.', ""Nonetheless, she went on to represent Australia in World Cup football, becoming the first woman to represent the country in World Cups in two sports, and continued for a short while to juggle both, representing Sydney FC in the Women's League."", ""By the time Perry had made her Test debut against England in 2008, she had already made headlines, when, days earlier, her unbeaten 29 that included a massive straight six, and four wickets on T20 international debut, led Australia to a 21-run win over England at the MCG. Initially, it was her bowling that proved her stronger suit, and she picked up her maiden five-wicket haul in an ODI against New Zealand in February 2010. Three months later, she was Australia's leading wicket-taker at the Women's World T20 in the Caribbean. That included a Player-of-the-Match-winning performance in the final, where her three wickets helped restrict New Zealand in a thrilling run chase and crown Australia world champions. She went on to play a vital role in all of Australia's four World Cup victories in as many years, though she will forever be remembered for the 2013 Women's World Cup final against West Indies, when, barely able to walk, she limped in to bowl 10 overs and took 3 for 19."", 'More recently, Perry proved her credentials as a genuine allrounder in back-to-back Ashes series. In 2014, she averaged 95.33 and was named Player of the Match in the only Test, as well as the overall Player of the Series, despite being on the losing team. She was also at the heart of Australia regaining the Ashes in August 2015, topping the tables for both batting (264 runs) and bowling (16 wickets), once again earning the Player-of-the-Series award.', ""From 2015 to mid-2017, Perry smashed 16 half centuries in 26 innings.

Paine originally broke his right index finger in November 2010, when he was struck on the hand by a Dirk Nannes delivery while batting in an Australian Cricketers' Association All-Stars T20 match, and it caused him considerable problems over the next few years. It was extremely unfortunate timing for Paine, who had played four Tests earlier in 2010 against Pakistan and India while Haddin recovered from an elbow injury. On the India tour especially, Paine had shown impressive ability with the bat, scoring 92 and 59, but his own injury problems led to Matthew Wade jumping him in the queue to become the new second-in-line to Haddin. Although Paine subsequently appeared in a few ODIs and T20s, he spent nearly six years out of the national set-up before being recalled in February 2017 for a T20 series against Sri Lanka. \n"", ""It had looked as though Paine would perhaps never play for Australia again, for at times, as his career progressed, he was not even the first-choice gloveman for Tasmania. In first-class cricket he suffered from a lack of hundreds - in fact, the 215 that he scored while playing as a specialist batsman in his fifth Sheffield Shield game, back in October 2006, remained his only first-class century. It was quite remarkable for a player with such talent, although Paine was often a fine domestic contributor and played in Tasmania's triumphant Sheffield Shield finals in 2006-07 and 2012-13. He had also played in two successful domestic one-day finals for the Tigers, and was Man of the Match in the 2009-10 final when he opened the batting and scored 100. A respected leader who often captained Tasmania, Paine also led the Hobart Hurricanes, and it was ultimately through T20 that his return to international cricket finally arrived."", 'The composure Paine showed in the shortest form, combined with the underwhelming contributions of Peter Nevill and Matthew Wade, led selectors to think laterally ahead of the 2017-18 Ashes, in which his selection was the most surprising and indeed contentious. But he performed admirably as part of a winning team, and then found himself thrust into the centre of things on the subsequent South Africa tour. He was initially the man who separated David Warner from Quinton de Kock in the Durban stairwell, then the man who replaced Steven Smith as captain the morning after the Newlands ball-tampering fiasco. His poise with the bat, behind the stumps and in front of the cameras had always marked Paine as a leader, now bolstered by the life experience of those years lost to finger surgeries.', '\n']",[],21.0,35,7,984.0,92,35.14,2278,43.19,0,5,107,3,87.0,5.0,35.0,35,3,890.0,111,27.81,1257,70.80,1,5,96,6,51.0,4.0,12.0,9,1,82.0,25,10.25,77,106.49,0,0,7,3,11.0,2.0,116.0,197,27,5015,215,29.50,11223,44.68,1,29,557,16,359.0,16.0,132.0,130,15,3844,134,33.42,5365,71.64,8,16,344,33,172.0,21.0,80.0,74,3,1637,91,23.05,1335,122.62,0,10,161,44,56.0,15.0,21.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,35.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,12.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,116.0,3,36,23,0,-,-,-,3.83,-,0,0,0,132.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,80.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

He saved his loudest grunt for his batting, where he was that rarest of modern-day creatures - an unabashed six-hitter in the mould of a George Bonnor or a Colin Milburn or a David Hookes. Batting for Gloucestershire at 20, he scythed 16 sixes in the first dig [a world record] against Glamorgan at Abergavenny, 20 for the match [another first], and then announced he couldn't care less about the milestone; he wanted only to help his team. His flaw was to attempt one six too many - invariably off the wrong ball - and get mixed up in off-field troubles.  \n"", '""I used to hate watching him bat,"" his old coach Toot Byron once lamented. ""He wasn\'t in control of his shot-selection ... he\'d get 24 off an over and then go out on the last ball of that over."" Legend has it that Symonds, a Queensland larrikin who shaved his dreadlocks early in 2009, once turned up barefoot and wearing a cowboy hat for a contract meeting with Cricket Australia\'s then-chief executive Malcolm Speed. He also ruled himself ineligible for any award at the 2006 Allan Border Medal - he would have been the One-Day Player of the Year - after being suspended for turning up drunk before Australia\'s embarrassing loss to Bangladesh on the 2005 Ashes tour. ', 'During almost five years in and out of the one-day side he frittered away golden opportunities galore. One day changed everything. Striding out with his team in turmoil against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup, a game and tournament he never expected to play in, Symonds sculpted a masterly 143 not out in 125 balls. Until that day, he had mustered just 762 one-day runs at only 23; after that he averaged more than 43 and became a hero to those who adored his clumping style. ""In the past,"" he admitted, ""I was a man without a map when I went out to bat."" He grew to understand his one-day role perfectly - he could have claimed to be the side\'s most valuable player after pounding three hundreds and taking 21 wickets in 2005-06. His impact to the limited-overs outfit was shown the following season after he ripped a tendon from his arm playing a fierce drive. Without him the team struggled to its worst losing streak in a decade. Symonds proved he was an incredibly quick healer by entering the World Cup mid-tournament and was part of his second consecutive triumph. ', ""Born in Birmingham, Symonds could have played for England but dreamed only of wearing the baggy green. In 2004 his fantasy was fulfilled in decidedly unGabbalike surroundings: the crackling minefields of Sri Lanka. He batted gamely without looking altogether comfortable, and was dumped after two Tests. Almost two years later he received an extended run as Australia's selectors searched for an answer to Andrew Flintoff, but he couldn't consistently mirror his one-day performances. Faced with the axe, he cracked a huge six at the MCG to open his scoring in a pressure-relieving 72 from 54 balls, which included a ground-record five maximums, but was dropped on the Bangladesh tour after struggling for reliable impact in the previous series against South Africa. Given another opportunity when Shane Watson was injured and Damien Martyn retired, he appeared in his first Ashes series and reached a career high in his second game with 156 at the MCG. Batting with his fishing friend Matthew Hayden, he showed he had the mindset to make it. "", 'The 2007-08 campaign was easily his best, with 777 runs in nine Tests against Sri Lanka, India and West Indies. The high was an unbeaten 162 in the first innings at the SCG, which was quickly followed by the low of a lengthy race row involving Harbhajan Singh. The problems did not prevent him becoming the most popular overseas player at the Indian Premier League auction, where he sold for US$1.35m, and he had four games with the Deccan Chargers. After the tournament he switched back into five-day mode and a pair of half-centuries in the tight opening contest with West Indies showed his growing batting maturity and sense of security at Test level. By the end of the campaign his average was a respectable 44.65. ', 'However, his off-field attitude continued to be a problem and the last straw came when he went fishing in Darwin when he should have been at a team meeting in the lead-up to an ODI series against Bangladesh. Symonds was sent home from the series and not picked for the tour of India in late 2008. He was rushed back in Australia and was involved in a pub scuffle while celebrating the first Test win, and he appeared in three more matches before undergoing knee surgery. A radio interview where he targeted Brendon McCullum was a factor in him being banned for the South Africa tour - along with his poor form for Queensland - and he was unconvincing in his one-day return in the United Arab Emirates. A breaking of team drinking rules led to his exit from the squad in England on the eve of the 2009 World Twenty20, and his Cricket Australia contract was soon cancelled. He retired from white clothes to become a Twenty20 specialist, playing for Queensland, Deccan Chargers and Surrey, and ultimately retired from all cricket in February 2012.']",['One-Day International Player of the Year - 2005'],26.0,41,5,1462.0,162*,40.61,2256,64.80,2,10,154,28,22.0,0.0,198.0,161,33,5088.0,156,39.75,5504,92.44,6,30,449,103,82.0,0.0,14.0,11,4,337.0,85*,48.14,199,169.34,0,2,33,10,3.0,0.0,227.0,376,33,14477,254*,42.20,,,40,65,,,159.0,0.0,424.0,377,51,11099,156,34.04,,,9,64,,,187.0,0.0,93.0,85,19,2141,117*,32.43,1453,147.35,2,12,194,83,42.0,0.0,26.0,41,2094,896,24.0,3/50,5/56,37.33,2.56,87.2,0,0,0,198.0,158,5935,4955,133.0,5/18,5/18,37.25,5.00,44.6,2,1,0,14.0,12,185,277,8.0,2/14,2/14,34.62,8.98,23.1,0,0,0,227.0,,17633,8714,242,6/105,,36.00,2.96,72.8,,2,0,424.0,,11714,9379,282,6/14,6/14,33.25,4.80,41.5,2,4,0,93.0,75,1237,1657,52,5/18,5/18,31.86,8.03,23.7,0,1,0,False,True,False,True

While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his older colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and his challenge was to take that white-ball form and perform just as consistently with the red ball. Starc struggled to gain the consistent backing of the selectors early in his Test career and was often in one Test and out the next, but in 2015 he finally enjoyed a solid run of Test cricket until an ankle injury stopped him during the home summer. His career-best match haul of 11 for 94 came in the notable surroundings of Galle - albeit in an Australia defeat - and he claimed 22 wickets in four Tests during the 2017-18 Ashes.

Smith's talent was apparent early, but as a young batsman he had more moving parts than an orchestra, only they didn't always work in harmony. He went away and worked on his game and returned to the Test side two years later with a much tighter technique. He still fidgeted between balls but could play every shot in the book, and a few more that defied words besides. Smith is quick-footed and adept at facing spin, but is equally comfortable driving and pulling the fast bowlers. His first Test century came at The Oval in the 2013 Ashes and his composure was apparent in the way he brought up the milestone with a six safely lofted down the ground. Over the next year he continued to improve and 2014-15 became the Summer of Steve, as he scored centuries in all four first innings of the home Tests against India. \n"", ""\nIt was also in the 2014-15 home summer that he became Australia's 45th Test captain, filling in for the injured Michael Clarke in three Tests. Despite being only 25 at the time his maturity in the role was evident, and the extra responsibility clearly didn't hamper his run-making. It became clear that Smith was to be Clarke's successor, a move that was confirmed after Clarke's retirement at the end of the 2015 Ashes in England. It was also clear that Smith had become the most important batsman in Australia's team; his 215 in the win at Lord's came after a promotion up the order to No.3. As Smith's batting developed his bowling became less frequently sighted, although he could still land the odd fizzing legbreak and winkle out a wicket or two. In the field Smith's athleticism and instinct stands out, even in a high quality fielding side like Australia. He has also become a key man in Australia's ODI side, and was his country's leading run scorer in their triumphant 2015 World Cup campaign.""]","['Allan Border Medal - 2015', 'Australian Test Player of the Year - 2015', 'Australian One-Day International Player of the Year - 2015', 'ICC Player of the Year - 2015', 'ICC Test Player of the Year - 2015']",64.0,117,16,6199.0,239,61.37,11171,55.49,23,24,684,36,96.0,0.0,108.0,94,12,3431.0,164,41.84,3973,86.35,8,19,289,31,62.0,0.0,30.0,25,5,431.0,90,21.55,352,122.44,0,2,34,11,18.0,0.0,118.0,208,26,10424,239,57.27,18176,57.35,37,44,1217,81,174.0,0.0,154.0,138,23,5226,164,45.44,5992,87.21,10,32,428,70,91.0,0.0,164.0,145,32,3325,101,29.42,2659,125.04,1,12,287,77,91.0,0.0,64.0,49,1339,933,17.0,3/18,4/83,54.88,4.18,78.7,0,0,0,108.0,36,1046,931,27.0,3/16,3/16,34.48,5.34,38.7,0,0,0,30.0,17,291,377,17.0,3/20,3/20,22.17,7.77,17.1,0,0,0,118.0,112,5057,3542,67,7/64,8/169,52.86,4.20,75.4,2,1,0,154.0,64,1988,1784,46,3/16,3/16,38.78,5.38,43.2,0,0,0,164.0,52,824,1056,54,4/13,4/13,19.55,7.68,15.2,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

A brutal bowler with a shoulder-strong action, Tait's body found the workload too tough in the long form and played only three Tests, and was done with first-class cricket by the age of 25.  \n"", ""In January 2008 he took an indefinite break from the game due to physical and emotional exhaustion and focused on one-dayers and T20s when he returned later that year. As a late addition to Australia's one-day squad in 2010, he unleashed a ball against England at Lord's that registered at 161.1kph, the second-fastest of all-time, but it was the consistent push for speed that crippled him regularly. "", 'With a muscular and unrefined method that seemed to invite pain, Tait played a significant role in Australia\'s World Cup triumph in the Caribbean in 2007, where he claimed 23 wickets; only Glenn McGrath took more throughout the tournament. He was back in the West Indies three years later when Australia reached the World T20 final, and was a key component in their pace-heavy but unsuccessful World Cup campaign in the subcontinent in 2011. That looked set to be his international swansong as he retired from ODIs straight afterwards and quit state cricket later that year, but he remained active in the Big Bash League. Five years later, he was back in Australia\'s T20 team after a surprising recall in the lead-up to the 2016 World T20. But that was the last we saw of Tait on the international circuit: he retired - from all forms of the game - the following March, saying it all came down to his injury issues again. ""The elbow has gone off a cliff now,"" he said.', ""The Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year back in the day in 2003-04, Tait also picked up the ING Cup's Best New Talent prize, chiefly for his 8 for 43 against Tasmania, the most impressive figures in domestic limited-overs history.

An abbreviated 2005-06 included 6 for 41 in the ING Cup final - an amazing combination of spot-on speed and 14 wides. Still, when on song, his old-fashioned approach of yorkers and bumpers mixed with a modern dose of sharp reverse-swing caused huge excitement for everyone but the batsmen.

At the start of his career it was hard to know whether he would develop into a nagging legspinner, aggressive middle-order batsman, intuitive skipper, or a bit of all three. After being tried as a Test leggie in India in 2008, it became apparent that batting was his focus and he developed into a destructive stroke-maker in the shorter formats. His maturity was recognised when he was named as Australia's Twenty20 captain in 2011. The appointment lasted only a year due to his batting form but it was a natural fit, for he had nearly a decade of captaincy experience having led Victoria in 2003-04 at the age of 20. The youngest skipper in their history, he won rave reviews for his cool head and warm handling of more hardened contemporaries. For all that, he remained a largely unassuming country lad. Picked to tour Zimbabwe when Stuart MacGill withdrew for moral reasons, White cancelled a fishing trip to attend the press conference then boyishly shrugged aside questions about the circumstances of his selection. He was chosen as much for his no-frills batting as his bowling; David Hookes, the late Victorian coach, felt White's best chance of representing Australia was to earn a top-six spot. \n"", 'White first emerged as a peculiarly unAustralian-style legspinner, tall and robust, relying on changes of pace and a handy wrong\'un rather than prodigious turn or flight. He would even start a spell with an offspinner or quicker ball. As far back as December 2002 his hero Shane Warne had predicted: ""I think he\'s a [future] Australian player provided he sticks to the way he plays and doesn\'t try to be someone different."" White made his ODI debut during the Super Series a year after missing a first Test cap when Nathan Hauritz was preferred in India. The retirement of Brad Hogg in early 2008 opened up an ODI spin position and White was given the first chance to secure the role. He even won a call-up to the Test squad in India when Victoria\'s first-choice leggie Bryce McGain went down with a shoulder injury. Despite his discomfort at being the No. 1 spinner, he held firm on debut while facing the best players of slow bowling in the business. As the series wore on it became clear he was not the answer to Australia\'s troubles and after four matches he was shifted aside with five wickets and 146 runs. It was time to try again as a batsman.', 'A clean striker of the ball who plundered ten centuries in two seasons of county cricket in 2006 and 2007, White has at times strangely struggled to convert his good starts into first-class hundreds back home. He did score 135 in the 2008-09 Sheffield Shield final against Queensland, though, and was relieved to lift the trophy after a series of near misses. He burst to life in 2009 with his first ODI century, 105 against England in Southampton, and another century came against Pakistan at home. White disappeared from the ODI side after being part of the 2011 World Cup squad but re-emerged in the T20 outfit in 2014 ahead of the World T20 in Bangladesh. The loss of the state captaincy to Matthew Wade for 2013-14 coincided with a strong personal campaign of 675 runs at 45.00, and any future internationals will certainly be as a batsman.\n', '\n']",['Australian Domestic Player of the Year - 2014'],4.0,7,2,146.0,46,29.2,330,44.24,0,0,15,1,1.0,0.0,91.0,77,16,2072.0,105,33.96,2586,80.12,2,11,145,45,37.0,0.0,47.0,44,14,984.0,85*,32.80,740,132.97,0,5,71,44,23.0,0.0,176.0,297,35,10494,260*,40.05,,,22,55,,,205.0,0.0,269.0,240,35,7703,165,37.57,9662,79.72,13,45,,,123.0,0.0,234.0,225,50,5433,141*,31.04,4290,126.64,2,35,378,227,96.0,0.0,4.0,8,558,342,5.0,2/71,3/119,68.4,3.67,111.6,0,0,0,91.0,19,331,351,12.0,3/5,3/5,29.25,6.36,27.5,0,0,0,47.0,5,42,51,1.0,1/11,1/11,51.00,7.28,42.0,0,0,0,176.0,,13754,8069,195,6/66,,41.37,3.51,70.5,,3,1,269.0,,4136,3729,104,4/15,4/15,35.85,5.40,39.7,4,0,0,234.0,42,484,708,26,4/10,4/10,27.23,8.77,18.6,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

Despite boasting an athletic figure made for photo shoots, Watson's frame was so brittle it threatened to break him. He refused to give up. Not through recurrences of back stress fractures, hamstring strains, calf problems, hip complaints, a dislocated shoulder or a suspected heart attack that turned out to be food poisoning. He changed his training, preferring pilates to weights, gave up alcohol, but not his dream. It finally paid off in 2009, when he was chosen as a Test opener in the middle of the Ashes series. Many batsmen would have been uncomfortable with the promotion from the middle order, especially after failing when given the job with Queensland, but Watson had become used to re-inventing himself. With a history of setbacks, it was not a surprise that his first Test century became such a drama, but after two scores in the 90s and an 89, he finally brought it up at the MCG against Pakistan - thanks to a single from a dropped catch. He had earned some luck. A productive few years as a Test opener led to back-to-back Allan Border Medals but by 2011-12, injury had again interceded. He returned to the Test team in 2012 but spent the rest of his career floating up and down the order in search of a place to call his own. \n"", ""\nIn 2013, Watson became Australia's 44th Test captain when he led the team to a three-day loss in Delhi in place of the injured Michael Clarke. It completed a hectic couple of weeks for Watson, who had been suspended from the previous Test in the homework saga and had also flown home for the birth of his child. He gave up the vice-captaincy after that tour and played for another two years before being dropped during the 2015 Ashes, after which he announced his retirement from Tests. As a bowler, Watson developed into one of Australia's best exponents of reverse swing, and if he was not claiming wickets himself he was often building pressure at one end. At times his bowling saved his place in the Test team, for four centuries from 59 Tests and an average of 35.19 was a little less than he desired as a batsman. At the crease he is an aggressive brute with a broad chest, a right-handed disciple of Matthew Hayden, and someone who often doesn't need to follow-through to gain a boundary. However, his drives and pulls are delivered in a much smoother style. Always a dangerous striker in the shorter formats, Watson clubbed Bangladesh for 185 in a 50-over contest in April 2011, the highest score ever by an Australian batsman in ODI cricket. The Player of the Tournament at the 2012 World T20, Watson retired from all international cricket at the end of the 2016 tournament.\n"", '\n']","['Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year - 2002', 'Australian One-Day International Player of the Year - 2010,2011, 2012', 'Australian Test Player of the Year - 2011', 'Allan Border Medal - 2010,2011', 'Australian Twenty20 International Player of the Year - 2012, 2013']",59.0,109,3,3731.0,176,35.19,7094,52.59,4,24,483,31,45.0,0.0,190.0,169,27,5757.0,185*,40.54,6365,90.44,9,33,570,131,64.0,0.0,58.0,56,6,1462.0,124*,29.24,1006,145.32,1,10,115,83,20.0,0.0,137.0,241,19,9451,203*,42.57,,,20,54,,,109.0,0.0,265.0,241,36,7915,185*,38.60,9187,86.15,11,46,,,88.0,0.0,300.0,292,33,7784,124*,30.05,5595,139.12,6,45,677,411,86.0,0.0,59.0,93,5495,2526,75.0,6/33,6/51,33.68,2.75,73.2,1,3,0,190.0,163,6466,5342,168.0,4/36,4/36,31.79,4.95,38.4,3,0,0,58.0,49,930,1187,48.0,4/15,4/15,24.72,7.65,19.3,1,0,0,137.0,,12164,6294,210,7/69,,29.97,3.10,57.9,,7,1,265.0,,8406,7063,213,4/36,4/36,33.15,5.04,39.4,3,0,0,300.0,231,4429,5838,216,4/15,4/15,27.02,7.90,20.5,3,0,0,False,True,True,True

If his bat isn't doing the talking his mouth probably is, and either way you can expect an assertive approach. One of the most destructive hitters in world cricket, Warner opens for Australia in all three formats and in 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching England's Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had also been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It also completed a remarkable rise for a man who burst on to the international scene in 2008-09 as a Twenty20 specialist; he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well. \n"", ""\nHis debut in the baggy green came, appropriately, in Test match No.2020, against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2011, and in his second match he achieved what Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden never did - he carried his bat through a Test innings. His unbeaten 123 in Hobart could not prevent a historic New Zealand win, but his patience in challenging conditions showed a different side to his batsmanship. Later in the same summer he made a very different kind of hundred, a 69-ball ton against India at the WACA that turned into a career-best 180. Over the next few years he became one of the most productive performers in Australia's Test order, and in 2014 he scored twin hundreds in the Cape Town Test against South Africa and then repeated the feat in Adelaide against India, in what was an especially emotional match as Australia returned to cricket following the death of Phillip Hughes.

He had also enjoyed two productive Sheffield Shield campaigns - 677 runs in 2009-10 and 553 runs the following summer.

However, his big break came when Haddin was forced to miss the Test series in the West Indies due to personal reasons. Wade grabbed his chance, scoring 106 in the third Test and dominating the bowling on a pitch where most of the other batsmen struggled to score quickly.', ""That maiden Test century was a huge moment in Wade's career, but the fact that he played any international cricket at all was a credit to his self-belief and his mental toughness: when only 16, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and required two cycles of chemotherapy to defeat the illness. Then, at 19, he made another crucial move, from Hobart to Melbourne, when he realised he would be stuck behind his childhood mate Tim Paine in the Tasmanian wicketkeeping queue. The Bushrangers immediately gave him a chance, and he grabbed it, making 83 and pouching six catches on his first-class debut.

He was relentlessly competitive, invariably aggressive, and as hard and uncompromising as the new ball. After an international career that lasted almost 15 years, the end was desperately unfortunate, as Boucher was forced to announce his retirement after being hit in the eye by a bail in a warm-up game on the tour to England in 2012, which would have been his last series anyway. Boucher finished with 998 international dismissals as a wicketkeeper, including 555 in 147 Tests. \n', ""Boucher's start in international cricket was uncertain. His relative lack of pure wicketkeeping skill and ability was exposed on South Africa's 1998 tour to England when he was repeatedly undone by the swing of the ball after it had pitched. However, Boucher had no peer in terms of temperament, guts and determination, and he duly fashioned himself into one of the finest glovemen in the game. He could often be seen, long after the rest of the squad had hit the showers after a training session, willing himself through another set of wicketkeeping drills. The hard work paid off, and he is likely to hold the record for Test dismissals - among many others - long after his retirement. "", ""As a batsman Boucher lived for the big moment, the quick 30 or 40 his team needed to win a match, or the session that had to be spent at the crease to ensure a draw. His most memorable innings was probably the scintillating unbeaten 50 he scored to complete South Africa's surge to a series-clinching target of 438 for 9 off the penultimate ball of a one-day international against Australia in Johannesburg in March 2006. "", 'Boucher strutted through 75 consecutive Tests before the suits thought he needed to be brought down a peg or two and dropped him for the tour to India in 2004. His reality duly checked, he returned to the national team as the ultimate man for the trenches. In the autumn of his career, his renewed commitment to his conditioning earned him extra years at the top, and helped him become the first wicketkeeper to take 500 catches in Test cricket. ', 'For a man who loomed so large in the world of cricket, Boucher started small. He was invariably smaller, and younger, than anyone else in the age-group provincial teams he played in. But the neon intensity in his eyes in the otherwise banal team photographs told of a kid who meant business. Boucher was a junior South African squash champion, and famously once played a national final with a racquet arm that had not long before emerged from a plaster cast. He lost, but in five games.

Between 2007 and 2011, Botha played 66 ODIs and took 64 wickets at an economy rate of 4.53. In the 2011 World Cup, he had a fine economy rate of 4.07 in the five matches he played.

Botha reworked his action but it was confirmed once again in September that he bent his arm more than 15 degrees. However, after another review in November, Botha's action was cleared by the ICC. More recently, he underwent biomechanical analysis and was cleared by Cricket Australia after being reported by the umpires in a domestic one-day match in October 2013."", 'Before Botha made his strides as a spinner, he was a medium pacer for the Eastern Cape Warriors - by his own admission he was quicker than 125 kmph.

But despite some success with provincial and South Africa A sides, it was only when Twenty20 cricket arrived in South Africa that Bosman etched his name into his country's cricketing consciousness. Pro20 cricket's first outing came at the end of the 2003-04 season, and Bosman - who was now part of the Eagles team under the new franchise system - topped the batting charts with 219 runs at a strike-rate of 120.99 and a high score of 84* despite the fact that he was asked to bat in the middle order.   \n"", 'Bosman was a key figure in South Africa A\'s campaign in a triangular one-day tournament in Sri Lanka in 2005-06, but it was his exploits at home that earned him a call-up to the squad for the Twenty20 International against Australia in mid-February. His 22-ball fifty against the Highveld Lions in February was the fastest in the Standard Bank Pro20 series. Player of the Series in the 2006 edition, Bosman became the first batsman to score a century in the competition, reaching three figures in just 43 balls. He failed to get going in the 2007 final, but his contributions to the Eagles clinching the Pro20 title were enough to earn him a look-in for the national Twenty20 side. He missed the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 due to a back injury, though Bosman insisted at the time that he was fit to play and he was subsequently suspended for one domestic match after being found guilty of ""unbecoming or detrimental"" conduct by Cricket South Africa over comments made to a local newspaper about coach Mickey Arthur after he was left out of the squad. ', ""Bosman turned down a contract with the Indian Cricket League in October 2007, instead signing up for the Mumbai Indians in the first edition of the Indian Premier League, though he couldn't make it into a starting XI. Bosman had a quiet international year in 2008, playing just one Twenty20 against Bangladesh, and at the end of the 2008-09 domestic season moved from the Eagles to the Dolphins franchise in KwaZulu-Natal. Initially named in a provisional squad of 30 for the 2009 World Twenty20, he couldn't find a place in the final 15, but in November of that year he fell one blow short of what would have been, at the time, just the second international Twenty20 century. Smashing 94 from just 45 balls, including nine sixes, against England at Centurion, he was also involved in a world record 170-run opening stand with Graeme Smith as South Africa racked up a mammoth 241 for 6. "", 'Bosman finally made it to a World Twenty20 tournament in the Caribbean in 2010, but appeared strangely out of sorts and made just eight runs in two innings, failing to find the boundary once. Despite that failure, he was signed by Derbyshire as their overseas player for the Friends Provident t20 tournament in 2010, and responded in superb fashion, hammering 94 off 50 balls to set up a crushing 65-run win over a strong Yorkshire side in June. ', ""As he heads into his mid-30s, Bosman's opportunities for South Africa may begin to wane, and though he will be remembered as a punishing Twenty20 batsman, it remains a mystery as to why he was never able to take his success in the format into 50-over or first-class cricket."", '\n', ' June 2010']",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,14.0,12,0,301.0,88,25.08,305,98.68,0,2,37,9,3.0,0.0,14.0,14,1,323.0,94,24.84,219,147.48,0,3,27,20,1.0,0.0,104.0,186,12,4962,140,28.51,,,6,25,,,56.0,0.0,170.0,164,12,4389,150,28.87,,,2,23,,,39.0,0.0,89.0,85,3,2085,104,25.42,1574,132.46,1,11,182,103,14.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,14.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,14.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,104.0,,576,343,8,3/25,,42.87,3.57,72.0,,0,0,170.0,,97,92,1,1/36,1/36,92.00,5.69,97.0,0,0,0,89.0,1,6,9,0,-,-,-,9.00,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

With his wristy leg-side flick and serene cover drive, Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket, while also effectively shifting gears to become the fastest batsman to 2,000 (40 innings), 3,000 (57 innings), 4,000 (81 innings) and 5,000 (101 innings) runs in ODI cricket.  \n"", ""Amla's career began at Durban High School, the alma mater of Lance Klusener and Barry Richards, and a world away from his brother, Ahmed. Just four years apart, they grew up on either side of the Apartheid divide, which meant that Ahmed went to a school for the previously disadvantaged, while Amla was afforded better opportunity at a more prestigious institution. "", 'After a successful school career, Amla toured New Zealand with the South African Under-19 team in 2000-01 and captained them at the 2002 Under-19 World Cup. After reeling off four centuries in his first eight innings of the 2004-05 season - in which he was also appointed, and stepped down as, Dolphins captain - he was picked to play for South Africa against India.  ', 'He was not an instant success, with serious questions emerging about his technique and his back lift, in particular, as he mustered 36 runs in four innings against England later that season.', ""When he was handed a second chance, he made it count with 149 against New Zealand at Cape Town, helping South Africa to a draw. He remained a consistent performer, even if not as prolific as South Africa would have liked, and made fifties against Pakistan in 2007. But he saved his best for the following year's tour of India, where he racked up 307 runs in three Tests. That included a majestic 159 in Chennai, his second score of 150 or more. He followed that with a pugnacious 81 in the second innings, in conditions that were trying, thanks to the weather, the pitch and the attack. In the summer of 2008, he got his name on the honours board at Lord's with a sublime century, and, in the process, silenced all whimpers about his pedigree for the longest version."", 'Still, doubts remained over his ability in the shorter formats, but Amla corrected that in 2010. He scored over 1,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket.  It started with a magnum opus tour of India, where the hosts threw everything at him, but could not find a way past his monk-like patience and ability to soak pressure. In the two-Test series, he scored 490 runs and was dismissed just once. In ODIs, he combined quick scoring with stunning consistency, scoring five centuries and four fifties in 15 innings, all the while scoring at over a run a ball, which saw him rise to No.1 in the ODI rankings that year.', ""He was promoted to South Africa's leadership core when he was named vice-captain of the ODI and T20 international teams in June 2011, and later that year, scored centuries in both Tests South Africa played against Australia at home. But Amla's crowning moment came the following year, when he got South Africa's quest to become the No.1-ranked Test team off to an epic start, spending 13 hours and 10 minutes at the Oval crease crafting a triple hundred, and not even needing a change of gloves. Amla also scored a century at Lord's as South Africa took the Test mace from the hosts. "", ""A quickfire 196 against Australia in Perth ensured South Africa stayed on top, and in February 2013, Amla was the ICC's top-ranked Test batsman. He had also decided to keep away from captaincy promotions, and stepped down as the limited-overs vice-captain. "", 'That was why it came as a surprise when, less than 18 months later, Amla accepted the Test captaincy. His tenure was off to a solid start as South Africa beat Sri Lanka 1-0 away from home in his first series in charge, and West Indies at home in his second, in which Amla scored a double hundred in the first match. But that proved a false dawn.', ""Amla had taken over a team in transition and South Africa's struggles came in 2015. They lost a four-Test series in India 3-0 and returned home to lose the opening Test against England. Amla's own form also suffered and he had not crossed fifty in a year. The New Year's Test of 2016 brought a change of fortune as he scored a double hundred, having decided to give up captaincy.

He scores runs with his wrist and bottom hand, takes pace off the ball when he bowls, and prowls the field from the point or cover region.  \n', 'Behardien got himself noticed in the 2011-12 season when he averaged 45.66 in the domestic limited-overs competition and 66.60 in the 20-over version. He was named the South African T20 player of the year at the 2012 awards, a label that helped push him through the door and into the national side.', 'He made his T20 debut in March 2012 and was included in the squad to play the World T20 in Sri Lanka that year. An ODI call-up came in January 2013 and he made more of an impact in the 50-over format at first. He scored his first half-century in his fourth match and also proved himself as a viable option to share the fifth-bowler duties. He was part of the squad that travelled to the 2013 Champions Trophy but did not play a game and it was only later, on tours to Sri Lanka and Australia, that he established himself as a regular. ', 'Consistency was hard to come by in a top-heavy line up that often left Behardien limited opportunity, but he took the chances he could. He had to switch between providing middle-order stability and taking on the finishing role and often found himself fighting to keep his place, especially in T20 cricket. He was part of the 2016 World T20 squad and only played once as South Africa were eliminated before the knockouts. That year, he also got his first IPL deal, with Kings XI Punjab.', ""In January 2017, Behardien was named South Africa's T20 captain for a three-match series against Sri Lanka. The accolade came on the back of strong performances for the Titans in the domestic T20 tournament, where he finished as the third highest-run scorer.

A tall, strong quick from Durban, his ability to bowl at pace and generate movement is what got him noticed. He began his career in the 2008-09 season for the Kwa-Zulu Natal provincial side and then represented the Dolphins franchise immediately thereafter.', 'He was recognised by national selectors when he was picked to play List-A matches against Bangladesh A, but remained on the fringes until 2012, when he was again called up to play 50-over matches against Sri Lanka A.', ""In the summer that Klusener took over as Dolphins' coach, Abbott's longer-form game developed and he was the leading wicket-taker in the first-class competition in the 2012-13 season with 49 scalps at an average of 15.36.

He ripped through Pakistan, taking 9 for 68 in the match - the third-best match figures by a South African on debut."", 'Abbott struggled for a regular Test spot in an attack whose regular quicks included Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander, and instead made a name for himself in limited-overs matches, where he accepted the responsibility of bowling at the death. While that did not always guarantee him a place in the side, he traveled with South Africa to the 2015 World Cup and found himself thrust into a bigger role when Philander picked up a hamstring injury.', ""He played in half of South Africa's six group stage matches and the quarter-final and was their most successful bowler in terms of strike-rate and economy. But he was left out of the semi-final XI in favour of the fit-again Philander, a decision that was later revealed as having been partly politically motivated. He went on to feature more regularly in the ODI and T20 teams and was also part of the side that played in the 2016 World T20."", ""Later that year, however, frustrated by the lack of certainty over his place, Abbott signed a three-year Kolpak deal with Hampshire to start in 2017. He did not inform Cricket South Africa or his team-mates until he got wind of that the news was going to break during the New Year's Test at Newlands. "", 'By then, Abbott was a first-choice pick in the Test team because of injuries to Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel and had played four matches in succession. He was also a preferred option for the one-day side and was being primed to open the bowling at the Champions Trophy. ', 'CSA held urgent talks with Abbott and his agent during the match but could not convince him to change his mind. Abbott confirmed his exit from the international stage after the match. His CSA contract was immediately terminated and he lost his place in the squad for the third Test.

By then, de Villiers had also accepted the responsibility of full-time Test gloveman after Mark Boucher's retirement, as well as the ODI and T20 captaincy after Graeme Smith stepped down. He later handed over the T20 reigns to Faf du Plessis. "", ""De Villiers blossomed with the additional responsibility, even as concerns over a chronic back injury grew. He was relieved from keeping in shorter formats to concentrate on captaincy when Quinton de Kock was included in South African squad. By 2014, he had also handed the Test keeper's gloves to de Kock. That seemed a sensible decision because Smith retired in March that year and de Villiers was believed to be the natural successor. However, he was overlooked in favour of Amla."", 'That did nothing to dim de Villiers\' resolve. He came back with even more striking power than before and in January 2015 broke the record for the fastest ODI century, reaching it in just 31 balls against West Indies at the Wanderers. That was the loudest warning cry he could have made for South Africa\'s chances at the 2015 World Cup, but it proved a false one. Despite inspirational leadership from de Villiers, who routinely called his team ""the best"" at the tournament, South Africa bowed out at semi-final stage.', ""  \nThe one stage de Villiers did not set alight was international T20 cricket, where he often found himself batting too low in the line-up and with not enough time to make an impact. He rectified that through the IPL, where he was one of the Royal Challengers Bangalore's most successful players. In a memorable match in the 2014 edition of the competition, de Villiers smacked his countryman Steyn for 23 runs in one over. "", '\nWith de Villiers in high demand from foreign leagues, his workload became a talking point in the 2015-16 summer when he suggested he would have to look at ways to lighten the load. There were rumours of early retirement but those were quashed when he was asked to stand in as Test captain when Amla gave up the job mid-series against England. It was a job de Villiers had always wanted and accepted immediately. He was appointed permanent Test captain in January 2016.\n', ' ']","['ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year - 2010, 2014, 2015']",114.0,191.0,18.0,8765.0,278*,50.66,16077.0,54.51,22.0,46.0,1024.0,64.0,222.0,5.0,228.0,218,39,9577.0,176,53.5,9473,101.09,25,53,840,204,176.0,5.0,78.0,75,11,1672.0,79*,26.12,1237,135.16,0,10,140,60,65.0,7.0,141.0,238,23,10689,278*,49.71,19026,56.18,25,60,,,275.0,6.0,263.0,252,44,11123,176,53.47,,,29,63,,,203.0,5.0,275.0,257,51,7405,133*,35.94,4995,148.24,4,48,611,335,188.0,16.0,114.0,5,204,104,2.0,2/49,2/49,52.0,3.05,102.0,0,0,0,228.0,9,192,202,7.0,2/15,2/15,28.85,6.31,27.4,0,0,0,78.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,141.0,,234,138,2,2/49,,69.00,3.53,117.0,0,0,0,263.0,,192,202,7,2/15,2/15,28.85,6.31,27.4,0,0,0,275.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

He also led the Lions' charge in the 2012-13 Sunfoil Series and finished with 32 wickets at 16.00 and three years later was rewarded with a Test call-up.

He made more of an impression as a batsman with 69 in his first match and he took that form into limited-overs' cricket as well. "", ""Six days after being picked up by Delhi Daredevils for a millions dollars, Morris proved his worth. He struck 62 off 38 balls to see South Africa draw level in the fourth match of a five-game rubber against England and later took them to a similarly thrilling win in a T20.

Jacques Kallis is the broad-shouldered colossus of the South African team, a figure whose looming presence inspires calm in some and dread in others.\n \nFew players who belong to the modern age are a better fit for the notion of the classical cricketer. Kallis is a fine, forceful batsman who has at his disposal both a rock-solid technique and a mind impervious to distraction. Though his role as a bowler diminishes with each passing season, he will be remembered as a purveyor of sometimes surprising pace and swing, and awkward bounce. In the slips, his sure-handedness and rattlesnake reflexes make ridiculous catches look regulation. \n', 'Kallis announced himself as a batsman of international stature in his seventh Test, the drawn Boxing Day epic at Melbourne in 1997, when he scored a fighting 101 on a worn last-day pitch. Not even Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne could dislodge him before he had all but saved the match for South Africa.', 'Over the years Kallis has delivered many such innings, performances in which grit is a far more valuable commodity than glitz to a South African team that remains more confident in the field and with its fast bowlers in full cry than as a batting unit. Kallis has willingly shouldered the role of the fulcrum around which the wheel must try to turn. But, occasionally, he has unfurled a stroke of startling aggression that hints at what might have been.', 'Certainly, his lofted drive, which begins with a menacing backlift before uncoiling into the irresistible momentum of a mighty downward swoop of the bat and finishing in a twirl of Baroque, might be described as Mozart in motion. In the lightning flash of that fleeting instant it really does seem as if Kallis could, in the words of one observer, hit a six whenever he felt like it.', ""His critics, particularly those who have a limited understanding of the dynamics of the South African team, accuse him of not dominating attacks he has already ground into the dust, of unnecessarily slow scoring, and of failing to take the match situation into account as he plots his innings. All of which hints at selfishness, which is quite ironical, because his team-mates vouch for the fact that Kallis bats the way he does precisely because he puts his team first and his personal ambitions some way behind. It's the only way he knows how."", ' ']","['ICC Test Player of the Year 2005', 'ICC Player of the Year 2005']",166.0,280.0,40.0,13289.0,224,55.37,28903.0,45.97,45.0,58.0,1488.0,97.0,200.0,0.0,328.0,314,53,11579.0,139,44.36,15885,72.89,17,86,911,137,131.0,0.0,25.0,23,4,666.0,73,35.05,558,119.35,0,5,56,20,7.0,0.0,257.0,421,57,19695,224,54.10,,,62,97,,,264,0,424.0,406,65,14845,155*,43.53,,,23,109,,,162.0,0.0,176.0,171,28,4416,97*,30.88,3927,112.45,0,32,437,100,54.0,0.0,166.0,272,20232,9535,292.0,6/54,9/92,32.65,2.82,69.2,7,5,0,328.0,283,10750,8680,273.0,5/30,5/30,31.79,4.84,39.3,2,2,0,25.0,19,276,333,12.0,4/15,4/15,27.75,7.23,23.0,1,0,0,257.0,,29033,13532,427,6/54,,31.69,2.79,67.9,,8,0,424.0,,13673,10772,351,5/30,5/30,30.68,4.72,38.9,3,3,0,176.0,150,2747,3482,114,4/15,4/15,30.54,7.60,24.0,2,0,0,True,True,False,True

With Jacques Kallis holding a monopoly over the allrounder's spot in the national side, McLaren struggled to break through and signed a Kolpak deal with Kent, where he blossomed. He took a hat-trick in the 2007 Twenty20 Cup final to help Kent win the trophy, and South Africa could not ignore him. "", ""Despite remaining under contract with Kent, McLaren was called up for South Africa's ODI squad to face Kenya and Bangladesh in October 2008, but the county refused to release him. It appeared an international career would not be possible until he was released from his county contract at the end of the 2009 season, making him eligible for selection for South Africa.

"", ""However, he struggled to hold down a place in the national side until early 2013, when South Africa were forced to look for a replacement for Kallis, who was being rested from bilateral series and asked to sit out the Champions Trophy. McLaren proved an able substitute. In 2013, he played 27 ODIs, notched up his highest score of 71 and took 45 wickets at 23.77. He was South Africa's highest wicket-taker that year and fourth highest overall. "", 'McLaren kept his place through most of 2014, although his form dipped. He had a poor limited-overs tour to Australia at the end of that year, which cost him a place in the 2015 World Cup squad. By then, he had played 54 ODIs, 12 T20Is and two Tests, and seemed to accept his international career was over.

Particularly in South Africa he had his supporters and detractors who debated his destructive yet inconsistent career and bulky frame. \n', ""Levi, a student of the Cape Ivy League schools, represented South Africa in the Under-19 World Cup in 2006, and quickly developed a reputation as a fearsome striker of the new ball, especially in the shortest format. Two Twenty20s into his international career, no one was in doubt of his abilities. In February 2012, opening the innings in South Africa's chase of 174 against New Zealand, Levi plundered 13 sixes - a record - in an unbeaten 117 off 51 balls, at the time the highest score in a T20I. He reached his century off 45 balls, also setting a new record of its day for the fastest ton in Twenty20 internationals. Granted, the Seddon Park in Hamilton isn't the biggest ground, but several of Levi's strikes sailed well past the boundary, and would have been sixes in most arenas. "", ""Hopes that Levi's success could provide South Africa with an exciting long-term replacement for Graeme Smith at the top of the order in the limited-overs formats soon foundered. His weight ballooned, his predominantly legside style did not suit everybody and he was deemed weak against spin: there was an uncultured feel about him, but his destructive qualities were evident."", ""The IPL, namely Mumbai Indians, came a calling in 2012 and later that year he played T20 for Somerset before beginning a lengthy association with Northants in 2013 and became a dangerous part of a cleverly-assembled side that won England's T20 tournament in 2013 and 2016 and were beaten finalists in 2015. He also found himself turning out in the Championship to help bolster a small and financially-challenged squad, although it did bring him the same pleasure.

Dad Peter led the South African attack through the 1960s; uncle Graeme was one of the finest, if not the finest, left-hander to play the game. Shaun has bits of both in his makeup, but it is as an immaculate, Hadlee-esque, line and length seamer that he has established himself. At the start of his first-class career, though, he was both slippery and aggressive and his Natal team-mates delighted in totting up the number of batsmen he pinned match after match. He was brought into the South African Test side against Michael Atherton's England tourists in 1995/96 and although his father was the convener of selectors, there was never a hint of nepotism and the younger Pollock took quickly to the higher level.  \n"", ""In 1996 he had a spell with Warwickshire cut short because of an ankle injury and missed the tour to India at the end of that year. But he soon returned to resume his new-ball partnership with Allan Donald and this pairing was the springboard of much of South Africa's success during the latter half of the 1990s. Indeed, it is possible to argue that the emergence of Pollock inspired Donald to greater heights as the latter found himself with a partner who both complemented and challenged him. Perhaps the straightest bowler in world cricket, Pollock is able to move the ball both ways at a lively pace. He also possesses stamina and courage in abundance as in proved in Adelaide in 1998 when he toiled on hour after hour in blazing heat to take 7 for 87 in 41 overs on a perfect batting pitch. "", ""If there is a criticism of Pollock, it is that he has underperformed with the bat, but most Test teams would be perfectly happy to have him in their side if he never scored a run. Pollock was thrust into the captaincy in April 2000 when Hansie Cronje was drummed out of the game, and he faced the biggest challenge of his career - to lift a shocked and demoralised South African side. However, after a solid start to his captaincy, he lost some credibility after a 3-0 drubbing in Australia in 2001-02, and was later blamed for South Africa's disastrous World Cup in which they failed to qualify for the Super Sixes. As a result, Pollock immediately lost the captaincy and was replaced by Graeme Smith. \nThough his nagging brilliance around offstump remains, his pace and ability to take wickets at the top of the order has dipped. "", ""Pollock missed the first Test against Australia at home in early 2006 with a back injury and was relegated from opener to first-change by the third. Four wickets in two Tests, with a new run-up and on pitches tailormade for his style, showed that he has slowed. But with 100 Tests under his belt, Pollock remains an integral part of the side. He missed the first Test against Sri Lanka due to the birth of his second daughter, returned for the second and was a pale shade of his former self. He managed just one wicket, and it was a telling sign of what appeared to be Pollock's decline to see him resort to offspin after being tonked over his head for six by Sanath Jayasuriya. All that was reversed in the Champions Trophy in India, where he showed great form, and against India and Pakistan at home at the end of 2006 and in the new year. Man of the Series in both the ODIs and Tests against India, Pollock was highly impressive with the new ball and chipped in with useful scores down the order. It was fitting that he became the first South African to take 400 Test wickets. Pollock continued his fine form against the touring Pakistanis next, despite being surprisingly rested for the final Test. Thrifty with the ball and useful with bat he offered precious control and breathing space for his captain. In the ODI series, he was the highest wicket-taker on either side and his 5 for 23 in the final game crushed a weary Pakistan. For the second consecutive one-day series in a row, Pollock was adjudged Man of the Series. It was decent form to carry into his fourth World Cup, but his lack of pace was exposed on the small Caribbean grounds, especially by Matthew Hayden, although his miserly spell against England was key in South Africa securing a semi-final berth. He lost his place in the Test line-up late in 2007 but returned against West Indies, on his home ground in Durban, for what turned out to be his final Test. He announced his retirement midway through the match, the following one-day series being his last international commitments."", '\n', ' January 2008']","['Natal debut 1992/93', 'Warwickshire 1996', 'Education: Northwood HS, Natal Univ (Dbn)', 'Junior Representative Cricket: Ntl Nuff 1991, SA Scho', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2003']",108.0,156.0,39.0,3781.0,111,32.31,7198.0,52.52,2.0,16.0,412.0,35.0,72.0,0.0,303.0,205,72,3519.0,130,26.45,4059,86.69,1,14,248,58,108.0,0.0,12.0,9,2,86.0,36*,12.28,70,122.85,0,0,4,4,2.0,0.0,186.0,267,55,7023,150*,33.12,,,6,35,,,132,0,435.0,297,91,5494,134*,26.66,,,3,24,,,153.0,0.0,46.0,34,7,569,59,21.07,401,141.89,0,1,45,28,9.0,0.0,108.0,202,24353,9733,421.0,7/87,10/147,23.11,2.39,57.8,23,16,1,303.0,297,15712,9631,393.0,6/35,6/35,24.5,3.67,39.9,12,5,0,12.0,11,243,309,15.0,3/28,3/28,20.60,7.62,16.2,0,0,0,186.0,,39067,15508,667,7/33,,23.25,2.38,58.5,,22,2,435.0,,21588,13141,573,6/21,6/21,22.93,3.65,37.6,18,7,0,46.0,43,937,996,45,3/12,3/12,22.13,6.37,20.8,0,0,0,True,True,False,True

He took 12 wickets in as many matches at 21.75 and earned a place in the South African XI that played against the touring England side in Kimberley."", ""He was then included in the South Africa A side that toured Zimbabwe and Australia that winter, and excelled in both the first-class and the limited-overs fixtures.

Peterson, a left-arm finger spinner from Eastern Province, fills all three vacancies more than competently. At first glance he seems an overly orthodox slow bowler, but he turns the ball appreciably given help from the pitch and is invariably a tidy operator with a steadily developing understanding of flight. Peterson has also cultivated an unusual delivery that turns into the right-handed batsmen.He was part of the South African Under-19 team that took on Pakistan and England, and he played the Under-19 World Cup in 1998. Peterson made his Test debut in 2003 against Bangladesh, taking five wickets and scored 61. It was in Bangladesh where he took his first five-wicket haul as well, on the 2008 tour. \n', ""Given more chances in ODIs, Peterson eventually began to grab his opportunities and his bowling, in particular, developed very usefully.

He slipped out of national contention for a time, and didn't play for South Africa again for two years, but in the meantime represented the Warriors with distinction. In April 2009 he moved to Cape Town and, despite having a year remaining on his Warriors contract, requested a transfer to the Cape Cobras because his partner wanted to pursue her career in the Western Cape.

He made himself unavailable for national selection and headed to Derbyshire as a Kolpak player. Nevertheless, he was named in South Africa's squad for the 2011 World Cup, and though his inclusion was initally greeted by scepticism in some quarters, Peterson proved the doubters wrong with some superb all-round performances.

At the peak of his powers, Steyn possessed a lithe and wiry body, a steaming run-up that culminated in a aerodynamic action, and a ripper of an outswinger. \n"", ""Steyn grew up in Phalaborwa, in the country's northern-most province, and spent his childhood obsessed with skateboarding. It was only when he moved to a bigger city, Pretoria, that he gave cricket a proper go and it did not take long before he was considered a serious prospect. He played just seven first-class matches before he was selected for South Africa and made his debut against England in 2004, in the same match as AB de Villiers. "", 'He did not have an immediate impact and spent the following winter playing for Essex in Division 2 of the county championship, and the 2005-06 season honing his craft in the domestic set-up before he was recalled, a visibly fiercer bowler. Steyn took 16 wickets in his second series, against New Zealand, but it was only when he faced them the next year, in the 2007-08 summer, that he announced himself as one of the fierce fast men. ', 'A visibly fired-up Steyn took ten wickets in the first Test in Johannesburg. Then, shortly after lunch on the first day of the second Test in Centurion, he delivered a short ball to Craig Cumming, who missed. The ball crashed into his face and sent him to intensive care. ', 'The flow of wickets became a gush, and in 2008, he became the fastest South African at the time, and the 15th fastest overall, to reach 100 Test wickets. That September, Steyn was named ICC Test Player of the Year after taking 86 wickets in 14 matches at an average of 18.10. ', 'He was part of the South African side that beat England and Australia for the first time away from home since readmission, and then proved he could do it on the subcontinent. In 2010, Steyn summoned reverse-swing reminiscent of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis and took 7 for 51 as South Africa beat India in Nagpur. ', 'He went on to win the Test championship with the team in England in 2012 and took his 300th Test wicket the following year, against New Zealand. He was only the fourth South African to rack up that many scalps. ', ""After he turned 30, Steyn's injury-free run ended. He suffered a groin strain in the Champions Trophy in June 2013, a side strain later that year and a rib fracture in early 2014, a year in which he had three hamstrings strains but also played a part in South Africa's first Test series win in Sri Lanka in over two decades."", ""He led South Africa's attack at the 2015 World Cup but also became the face of their failed campaign. He delivered the final over in the semi-final against New Zealand and was hit for six by Grant Elliott off the penultimate ball."", ""Steyn did not seem to be the same afterwards. In November 2015, he suffered a groin strain during the first Test against India in Mohali and missed the rest of the four-match series. He returned in December to play against England but a shoulder injury cut short that summer. In the 2015-16 season, Steyn missed six of South Africa's eight Tests and all their ODIs.

In the next season, he was the second-highest run-getter in the one-day cup. \n \nHe was rewarded with a place in the South Africa A squad which toured Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in 2010. Rossouw averaged over 40 in first-class cricket in three of the four seasons which followed - 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 - and despite regular appearances in A sides, he was still unable to break into to the Test team. ', 'One particular tweet did not help. Like many South Africans, Rossouw, then 21, took the team\'s quarter-final defeat to New Zealand at the World Cup hard. His post included the word ""chokers"" and, although it was soon deleted, the memory stuck.\n \nIt was in the shorter formats where he had more opportunities. In 2014, Rossouw picked up an IPL contract with Royal Challengers Bangalore, although playing opportunities were limited in a star-studded squad. Eventually, in August that year, he was included in a South Africa\'s ODI squad. ', 'He toured Zimbabwe for a visit that also included a tri-series against Australia. He had a nightmarish start to international cricket and racked up four ducks in his first six innings.

He was also included in the T20 squad for the Australia tour in November 2014, where he scored 78 in his first match in Adelaide. ', ""In January 2015, Rossouw scored his first international century, against West Indies in Johannesburg, in a match in which several records were broken including the fastest ODI century at the time, scored by AB de Villiers. Rossouw had done enough to be included in the 2015 World Cup squad where he played in six matches, including the quarter-final and semi-final. Rossouw was also part of South Africa's 2016 World T20 squad, bagging a duck in the only match he played.

The man was born to bat this way, right down to the same Lara leap upon reaching a century.', ""\n \nIt was that century that eluded Bravo for his first 31 ODIs, nine Tests and four T20Is. The appetite, though, was there. For a stylish and attacking batsman, he is one of the few young stars in world cricket who feel more at home as the length of the format increases. His early century drought might suggest otherwise, but he is a man for long innings, a man who seems to love to bat on and on. His first century arrived in Bangladesh, in his tenth Test, and he made it a big one, falling five short of a double. He scored two more in the series in India immediately after. After 12 Tests his run aggregate and average were identical to that of Lara's after 12. He scored his first ODI century against Zimbabwe in 2013."", ""\n \nOf course Bravo doesn't have to face the quality of bowling Lara did, and he bats a position lower that Lara's No. 3.

Unfortunately for West Indies, they haven't been able to utilise his services as often as they probably would have liked to: till the end of 2013, more than nine years since his Test debut, he had played only 40 out of West Indies' 81 Tests in the same period. Prioritising IPL over international cricket has led to differences with the board, while injuries have also limited his Test appearances, but as a limited-overs player Bravo remains a key member for West Indies and took over from Darren Sammy as ODI captain in 2013. He held the post till December 2014, when the selectors replaced him with Jason Holder and left him out of the ODI side, two months after he had played a central role in the team pulling out mid-way from a tour to India due to issues with the payment structure in their revised contracts.  \n"", ""As a player, Bravo's skills and self-confidence at the big stage were never in doubt right from the early days in his international career. He made his Test debut at Lord's in July 2004, and took three wickets in the first innings with his medium-paced swingers. He also showed a cool enough temperament to forge a confident start at the crease with the bat. By the end of the series, it was clear that Bravo was a special talent. He scored plenty of runs and claimed a bunch of wickets in four Tests, but nowhere was his ability more evident than in Manchester, where he top-scored for the team, and then restricted England with a six-wicket haul. He hit 107 against South Africa in April 2004-05 at Antigua to bring up his maiden century and in November 2005, scored a magnificent 113 against Australia at Hobart. He dazzled in the ODI series against India in May 2006, bamboozling the batsmen with his slower ones and chipping in with match-winning contributions with the bat. He grew as a player in the limited-overs format in the 2006-07 season with a fluent unbeaten 112, his maiden ODI ton, against England in the Champions Trophy and achieved his best career figures, 4 for 39, against India in the last game before the World Cup. He was often a rare glimmer of joy among some depressing moments until an ankle injury struck in 2008 and ruled him out for eight months. "", ""Around that time, his value as a Twenty20 player came into focus, and with several such leagues coming - most prominently the IPL - Bravo chose those commitments over the West Indians ones. In 2010, he, along with Kieron Pollard, turned down a WICB central contract which would require him to be available to play for West Indies at all times. Next year, he chose the IPL over a two-Test home series against Pakistan. Between 2011 and 2013, West Indies played 24 Tests but Bravo didn't play any of them. He retired from Test cricket in January 2015."", 'On the other hand, he became a fixture in the Chennai Super Kings line-up in the IPLs: in the 2013 season, he led the wickets tally with 32. He came back to play for West Indies in the limited-overs games, but the feeling persisted that West Indies were severely under-utilising his talents.', '\n']",[],40.0,71,1,2200.0,113,31.42,4527,48.59,3,13,269,21,41.0,0.0,164.0,141,24,2968.0,112*,25.36,3606,82.30,2,10,240,58,73.0,0.0,66.0,59,12,1142.0,66*,24.29,981,116.41,0,4,67,49,35.0,0.0,100.0,180,7,5302,197,30.64,,,8,30,,,89.0,0.0,227.0,198,30,4046,112*,24.08,,,2,13,,,105.0,0.0,439.0,357,99,6218,70*,24.10,4900,126.89,0,20,404,297,216.0,0.0,40.0,61,6466,3426,86.0,6/55,6/84,39.83,3.17,75.1,6,2,0,164.0,150,6511,5874,199.0,6/43,6/43,29.51,5.41,32.7,6,1,0,66.0,56,1042,1470,52.0,4/28,4/28,28.26,8.46,20.0,2,0,0,100.0,,11025,5918,177,6/11,,33.43,3.22,62.2,9,7,0,227.0,,8609,7494,271,6/43,6/43,27.65,5.22,31.7,8,2,0,439.0,420,8514,11731,480,5/23,5/23,24.43,8.26,17.7,9,2,0,False,True,True,True

Built like a fast bowler, and with the fiery attitude of one, Benn is also no stranger to on-field controversies. In 2007, he was involved in an ugly incident with batsman Robin Parris during a club game at Queen\'s Park Oval, and in 2009 was involved in a heated on-field argument with Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson in the third Test at Perth. There were yet more charges to be added to his sheet, as Benn was dismissed from the field by his own captain during South Africa\'s one-day whitewashing of West Indies in 2010  after apparently refusing to bowl over the wicket, and in the Test series which followed was involved in several colourful exchanges with Dale Steyn.  \n', ""But between the controversies came consistent performances which made clear his passion, determination and skill as a bowler and Benn has also cemented a spot as West Indies' most reliable spinner in years.

He has been economical without being spectacular for West Indies in one-day cricket, but registered remarkable figures of 4 for 6 in a Twenty20 against Zimbabwe in early 2010 - a match that, however, West Indies went on to lose. He picked up eight wickets in the first Test against England at Sabina Park in February 2009 to help set up what was ultimately a Test series win - although his efforts were forgotten amid Jerome Taylor's destruction of England's top order.

With a couple of other senior batsmen, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chris Gayle, not being available due to various reasons, Chanderpaul's contributions were immense, as he has defied bowling attacks in all countries and all conditions, often with minimal support from the other end. One of the best examples of that was against Australia in 2012, in the series in which he got to 10,000 Test runs: he ran up scores of 103*, 12, 94, 68 and 69, for an aggregate of 346 in five innings.

Dottin was among only two women, apart from Stafanie Taylor, to receive a Grade A contract. She has, however, been vocally critical of the continued pay disparity between men's and women's cricket."", ""She was largely responsible for West Indies' victory in the T20 tri-nation tournament - also involving England and New Zealand Women - in November 2013, slapping 46 unbeaten runs off 35 balls in the final and being named Player of the Series. More recently, she has proved her worth as a handy pace bowler, taking 4 for 12 against England in the 2014 Women's World Twenty20, which helped West Indies win the group match by nine runs. She was also a crucial part of West Indies' victory in the following edition of the tournament. Dottin took nine wickets at 13.55, including 2 for 33 in the final, as West Indies became the only team outside of England, Australia and New Zealand to win a global tournament.

Spotted in the nets by Brian Lara, he was called up for his Test debut after just one match for Barbados, and promptly took five wickets against Sri Lanka in Jamaica in June 2003. He added five in his first overseas Test, and six in his first one-day international. With a round-arm action not unlike Jeff Thomson's, which has left him vulnerable to back strains, he was more of a protégé of his neighbour Corey Collymore than his half-brother Pedro Collins. He bowls fast, can swing the ball and get reverse swing, but insists that he does not go for out-and-out pace.  \n"", ""Despite regular chances at Test level, however, he rarely showed enough control to be a match-winner and the selectors blew as hot and cold as did his bowling.  They did draft him into the squad to tour England in 2007. He bowled well in the Chester-le-Street Test but was fined for swearing too loudly, and an unproductive series in South Africa followed. He lost his spot for the first Test against Sri Lanka, was recalled in Trinidad and grabbed five wickets to help West Indies draw the series. At one-day level he was given a long run in 2006 but axed towards the end of the year after failing to shine at the Champions Trophy. Edwards was not needed at the World Cup but, on his ODI recall, he blasted through England with 5 for 45 at Lord's."", ""He reached a personal milestone in the second Test against New Zealand at Napier on West Indies' 2008-09 tour, taking 7 for 87 - his career-best figures - to pass 100 Test dismissals. Settling into the role of senior bowler in the West Indies side, he bowled aggressively without much reward on England's tour of West Indies in early 2009, and was particularly venomous towards Kevin Pietersen and James Anderson. But arguably his most important performances in the series came with the bat, as he and Daren Powell clung on for 60 balls to secure a draw in the third Test in Antigua. Edwards was at it again in the fifth Test in Trinidad, surviving a tense finale to secure the Wisden Trophy for the first time since 2000."", ""But just as Edwards began to find the consistency that had long eluded him, he picked up another back injury in the course of West Indies' campaign at the World Twenty20 in England in June 2009. He returned to Barbados and was put on a remedial programme, but abandoned it to represent Deccan Chargers in the Champions League later that year. He picked up another injury in the course of that tournament, and was ruled out of West Indies' tour of Australia - perhaps a relief as the depleted side failed to win a single game. The last of his 55 Tests came against Bangladesh in Khulna in 2012."", 'Hampshire benefited from his presence in 2015. By picking up 45 Championship wickets at 20.8 from eight matches, he was the prime force in their First Division survival, taking 10 wickets in a first-class match for only the second in his career as Hampshire crucially beat Nottinghamshire in the last match to avoid relegation. A broken ankle suffered in a pre-match warm-up at Headingley wrecked his 2016 season as Hampshire only escaped relegation because Durham were demoted after a financial bale-out, but a useful season a year later again helped Hampshire escape on the final day.

But a lack of respect, for opposition bowlers at least, has served Gayle well since then. Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers. And in this era of Twenty20 cricket, Gayle is the batsman who has thrived like no other. \n', ""Among his many strengths, perhaps the biggest one is his outstanding hand-eye coordination, which allows Gayle to regularly hit even good-length deliveries for boundaries. Technique and footwork aren't his greatest assets, but most often he compensates with other skills. No batsman has taken to the 20-over format like he has. He showed early signs of his liking for that format by smashing the first century in Twenty20 internationals - a 57-ball 117 against South Africa in the World Twenty20 in 2007 - and when Twenty20 leagues mushroomed the world over and sought international stars, Gayle was the biggest beneficiary. "", 'Over two seasons - 2011 and 2012 - of the IPL, he became easily the most feared batsman of the league, smashing more hundreds and sixes than any other batsman, by far. When he carted Pune Warriors all over the ground to score an unbeaten 175 in IPL 2013, it felt right that he should finally own the record for highest individual score, fastest century, and most sixes in a Twenty20 innings, because no batsman has dominated Twenty20 cricket like he has. ', ""Gayle's free-stroking, aggressive style is obviously best suited for limited-overs cricket, but that doesn't mean he hasn't cut it as a Test batsman. When he has turned up for West Indies, his pugnacious approach has become an attacking weapon in its own right, in what's been a lean era for West Indian cricket. His 79-ball century at Cape Town in January 2004, on the back of a South African first innings of 532, was typical of his no-holds-barred approach. However, Gayle has also shown the ability to bat long periods and the hunger to make big scores. In 2009 against Australia, Gayle batted almost seven-and-a-half hours in scoring an unbeaten 165 to save the Test in Adelaide; in the very next game, though, he smashed the fifth-fastest Test century - off 70 balls - to indicate that quick-scoring remained his preferred method. Next year he batted almost ten hours and scored 333 against Sri Lanka and Muralitharan in Galle, becoming only the fourth batsman to score two triples in Tests, thus proving again his ability to bat long periods."", ""And then there is also his brisk non-turning offspin, with which he has turned himself into a genuine allrounder in limited-overs cricket. His tendency to stay aloof on the field sometimes suggests he isn't interested in the proceedings, but his relaxed approached was good for the team whenever he led West Indies. However, West Indies have missed his services far too often due his differences with their board. During his exile, he was a Twenty20 regular in various leagues around the world, entertaining crowds in Australia, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. After a long spell out from international cricket he returned strongly in 2012 on the tour of England and subsequently at home against New Zealand.""]",[],103.0,182,11,7214.0,333,42.18,11970,60.26,15,37,1046,98,96.0,0.0,289.0,283,17,10151.0,215,38.16,11649,87.14,25,51,1093,314,120.0,0.0,58.0,54,4,1627.0,117,32.54,1139,142.84,2,13,138,105,15.0,0.0,180.0,321,26,13226,333,44.83,,,32,64,,,158.0,0.0,361.0,354,24,12860,215,38.96,,,29,67,,,150.0,0.0,371.0,363,47,12318,175*,38.98,8374,147.09,21,76,942,907,87.0,0.0,103.0,104,7109,3120,73.0,5/34,6/81,42.73,2.63,97.3,2,2,0,289.0,195,7334,5846,165.0,5/46,5/46,35.43,4.78,44.4,3,1,0,58.0,23,319,377,17.0,2/15,2/15,22.17,7.09,18.7,0,0,0,180.0,,12511,5194,132,5/34,,39.34,2.49,94.7,,2,0,361.0,,9610,7300,227,5/46,5/46,32.15,4.55,42.3,4,1,0,371.0,131,1945,2479,80,4/22,4/22,30.98,7.64,24.3,2,0,0,False,True,False,True

Less than a year later, he took over the Test team too, indicating how much the WICB and men in the know - ranging from Viv Richards to Brian Lara to Tony Cozier - believed in this man, who comes across as remarkably level-headed and mature for someone so young.  \n"", ""A reliable batsman and a steady medium-pacer - both suits being works in progress - Holder was born in Barbados and was the recipient of the prestigious Lord Gavron Award in 2009.

After nearly 650 overs, he went into IPL 2016 with 216 wickets at an economy rate of 5.52. Such highs were beyond him in the Test arena though; his last match came in December 2013 and his bowling average remains a dismal 40.52."", '\n', '\nNarine ran into serious trouble with his bowling action in the Champions League Twenty20 2014. He had to rework it once before too, in 2011, with the help of bio-mechanical experts at the University of Western Australia in Perth, prior to making his ODI debut in India. But it was in India that his career began to take a nosedive. He was called for a suspect action in back-to-back matches in the CLT20 2014 and was subsequently banned from playing the final in Bangalore. He was withdrawn from the West Indies squad, who were due to play the hosts in a limited-overs series of five ODIs and a T20 in October that year. Then he withdrew himself from the squad named for the 2015 World Cup, citing the need to keep working on his bowling action.', '\n', '\nNarine was lost to international cricket for over a year, but he returned to the West Indies side in November 2015 and ran into trouble with his action again. This time it was the ICC who were on his tail and he was subsequently suspended from bowling in international cricket. He was ranked the No. 1 bowler in T20Is when he was picked for the World T20 in 2016, but withdrew from the tournament to focus on his rehabilitation.

Mumbai Indians weren't paying $750,000 (plus an undisclosed amount to break a tie with three other franchises) for Pollard's international record; they were shelling out all that money for the fearsome hitting power he had shown in domestic T20 action - most notably while smashing 54 off 18 balls for T&T against New South Wales during the 2009 Champions League T20. \n"", '\nThat IPL auction signaled a shift in the world game and, in the months ahead, Pollard continued to show how much ground franchise cricket had gained on the international game. He opted out of the West Indies A team in order to play T20s for Somerset and then refused a WICB central contract, since signing it would mean making himself available at all times for West Indies.', ""\nOver the next few years, Pollard improved his international record, scoring a pair of half-centuries at the 2011 World Cup and then, later that year, breaking his century duck by slamming a 110-ball 119 in a crisis situation against India in Chennai. There were plenty of explosive T20 finishes as well, including a 15-ball 38 that put the 2012 World T20 semi-final well beyond Australia's reach."", ""\nBut through it all, the canvas of franchise cricket remained the best medium to showcase the hulking Pollard's unbridled hitting - with his top hand frequently slipping off the bat handle even as the ball disappeared far over wide long-on - and canny medium-pace. Mumbai retained Pollard after his first season for them and he rewarded their faith in his abilities with, among other match-winning performances, an unbeaten 32-ball 60 that gave them their maiden IPL title."", '\nThough widely considered a limited-overs specialist, Pollard has expressed a desire to play Test cricket, and has a fairly good first-class record behind him, including a whirlwind 126 on debut for Trinidad and Tobago against Barbados. But that call-up has yet to materialise.', ""\nPollard was left out of West Indies' ODI team in December 2014, ahead of a series in South Africa. His axing - along with Darren Sammy and Dwayne Bravo - came soon after West Indies pulled out of their tour of India with an ODI, a T20 and three Tests still remaining, due to a dispute with the board and the players' association over payment structures. "", ""Pollard returned to international cricket in June 2016 with an improved defensive technique and the stomach for a fight. Against South Africa, he took the score from 21 for 4 to a match-winning 285. The 156-run partnership he shared with Darren Bravo is West Indies' best for the fifth wicket.

That both titles came in the T20 format defines the kind of cricketer he is. A batsman who hits the ball hard enough to make the inanimate thing scream for mercy, he functions primarily as a finisher. He generates even more pace with the ball in hand and when it is anywhere near him in the field, it doesn't matter at what pace it's travelling. Russell will probably get to it. He is less a cricketer, in the traditional sense, than an athlete.  \n"", ""An allrounder from Jamaica, Russell made his first-class debut at the age of 19. He made his way into the West Indies A squad and captured plenty of attention with his exploits in a 50-over game against Ireland in June 2010, smashing 61 off 34 balls and taking 6 for 42. It was a performance that helped him win a place in West Indies' 2011 World Cup squad. Things didn't go to plan there, but his capabilities were on show against the newly-crowned champions India in June when he came out at No. 9, with the score at 96 for 7, and smashed 92 off 64 balls. "", 'Russell\'s impact in international cricket was a bit sporadic until 2015, against South Africa in Port Elizabeth, when he provided a consolation victory for West Indies on a difficult tour by hitting 64 off 40 balls to chase down 263 with one wicket to spare. ""My thing,"" is how he described batting in the slog overs. ""I think I really enjoy when there\'s five overs or ten overs left."" ', ""Those skills were evident in domestic T20 cricket though. He had a fine season with Worcestershire at the Friends Life t20 in England in July 2013 and a ground-breaking Caribbean Premier League a month later when his team Jamaica Tallawahs became champions. Russell's star shone brightest at the IPL 2015, when he was named Man of the Series, and the Big Bash League 2015-16 when he struck at 186.86 and picked up 16 wickets - joint-second best - from 10 matches. He won the CPL title with Tallawahs in 2013, the IPL title with Kolkata Knight Riders in 2014, the Bangladesh Premier League title with Comilla Victorians, the BBL title with Sydney Thunder and the Pakistan Super League title with Islamabad United in 2016. "", 'His flamboyant style is a part of his personality as well, which became apparent as he unveiled a hairstyle similar to Mr T at the 2015 World Cup. A year later, with his mohawk dyed blonde, Russell applied the final touches to a mauling of hosts India in the World T20 semi-final as West Indies became the first team to win the trophy twice.', 'During the most successful period of his T20 career, however, a cloud hung over Russell because the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission had charged him for not filing his whereabouts clause three times in 2015, an offence tantamount to one failed dope test. After hearings that went on over a year, Russell was found guilty of a whereabouts-clause violation and banned for one year by an independent doping panel in Jamaica. The ban was from January 31, 2017, until January 30, 2018.']",[],1.0,1,0,2.0,2,2.0,9,22.22,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,52.0,44,9,998.0,92*,28.51,765,130.45,0,4,91,54,11.0,0.0,47.0,39,13,465.0,47,17.88,329,141.33,0,0,30,32,11.0,0.0,17.0,24,1,609,128,26.47,,,2,0,,,6.0,0.0,89.0,75,18,1917,132*,33.63,,,2,8,,,22.0,0.0,287.0,239,58,4456,121*,24.61,2675,166.57,2,13,304,333,134.0,0.0,1.0,2,138,104,1.0,1/73,1/104,104.0,4.52,138.0,0,0,0,52.0,51,2176,2128,65.0,4/35,4/35,32.73,5.86,33.4,5,0,0,47.0,40,595,908,25.0,2/10,2/10,36.32,9.15,23.8,0,0,0,17.0,31,2083,1104,54,5/36,9/78,20.44,3.18,38.5,4,3,0,89.0,86,3663,3317,126,6/28,6/28,26.32,5.43,29.0,5,4,0,287.0,267,4896,6677,259,4/11,4/11,25.77,8.18,18.9,7,0,0,False,False,True,True

In the 2010 IPL auction, he was bought by Deccan Chargers for a healthy sum of $720,000, but it's in the longer format that he holds the greatest promise, a fact that was confirmed by his ten-wicket haul in two Tests in Sri Lanka in 2010-11.

Significantly down on pace after his recovery and return, he took just nine wickets in eight Tests that included a tour of England, and home and away series against Australia. He was left out ahead of the 2016 home Tests against India.

For a long time, though, it seemed Rampaul might never fulfill his potential at international level, as he did little of note in his first six years in international cricket, partly due to injury: he was picked to tour southern Africa in 2003-04, and England later that year, but he broke down and returned home, shin splints sidelining him for more than a year. He played intermittently thereafter, but when belatedly given an opportunity towards the end of the 2011 World Cup, Rampaul instantly made his mark with a five-for against India and then sustained his form in the home season, taking 11 wickets in the two-Test series against Pakistan, which was almost three times the haul in his first five Tests.

Originally a fast bowler who then kept wickets when he had finished his stint with the ball, Ramdin's overall cricketing acumen was spotted early, as he led both Trinidad & Tobago's and West Indies' Under-19 sides before being selected, aged 19 and with only 13 first-class games under his belt, as first-choice gloveman for the senior squad's tour of Sri Lanka in 2005. \n"", ""Ramdin impressed with his smooth and agile movements behind the stumps, and made a half-century on Test debut in Colombo. Ramdin scored a plucky 71 against an Australian attack, comprising Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee, Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill, later that year, in Hobart. \n \nWhen India toured the West Indies in mid-2006, Ramdin's wicketkeeping was impressive on pitches where the ball often died even before reaching him. His batting was patchy, though a superb calculated assault on the Indian bowlers in the final stages of the Kingston Test proved a fine reminder of his prowess in that quarter as well."", 'However, over a period of time, his batting became increasingly inconsistent while his wicketkeeping dropped a notch from his earlier high standards. He did make his maiden Test century - 166 against England in Barbados - in March 2009, but that was followed by ordinary performances against Australia and South Africa, which led to him being dropped from the Test and ODI teams.', ""He eventually returned to the Test side on the tour to England in 2012 after an absence of almost two years. After not doing much with the bat in the first two Tests, Ramdin struck an undefeated 107 in the third Test, but soured the occasion by flashing a note addressed to Viv Richards, who had earlier criticised Ramdin's lack of contribution on the tour. Though Ramdin apologised later, the act earned him plenty of criticism, and a fine of 20% of his match fee by the referee."", ""However, that century did revive his batting fortunes: in the next 18 months, from June 2012 to December 2013, Ramdin scored three hundreds in 12 Tests and averaged 53.61; in 44 Tests before that, he had averaged 22.28. His ODI form also saw a spike, in 2014, when he scored 516 runs in 13 games, studded by a 169 off 121 balls against Bangladesh in St Kitts in August -  the highest score by a West Indies batsman at home, beating Desmond Haynes' 152 not out against India in Georgetown in 1989."", ""In May 2014, he was rewarded with the Test captaincy, as West Indies decided to replace Darren Sammy.

All that changed, however, on the final day of the third Test at Newlands, where he brought the calypso back to Caribbean cricket with a wonderful debut century. Smith had been given a surprise opportunity - ahead of his Grenadian namesake Devon - when Marlon Samuels flew home with a knee injury.

While he has only managed a brief and disappointing Test career, he has shown his value as a limited-overs player for West Indies, particularly in the shortest format, and has also forged a successful career for various franchises around the world including Mumbai Indians, Brisbane Heat and Karachi Kings. ', ' \n', ' \nSimmons, the nephew of the former West Indies allrounder Phil, was handed his international debut in late 2006, during an ODI series in Pakistan, and scored 70 in his second match.

', ' \nHe returned in March 2009, this time making his Test debut, having forced his way back by scoring 282 in a first-class game for West Indies A against the touring England XI. His returns, however, were poor: the last of the eight Tests he has played so far came in October 2011, and his 16 innings have only yielded a highest score of 49. ', "" \nBut he has enjoyed happier times in the limited-overs formats. ODI highlights include the 792 runs he scored in 2011, at 49.50, including a maiden century and eight fifties, and the start he enjoyed to the 2015 World Cup, with an 84-ball 102 against Ireland followed by a 46-ball 50 against Pakistan. In T20Is, he has been a frequent source of brisk runs anywhere in the top four. He has been one of the most consistent overseas players in the IPL, and topped Mumbai's run-charts with 540 runs at 45.00, helping the team clinch the IPL title in 2015. "", "" \nSimmons played a brief but vital role in West Indies' title run at the 2016 World T20. Initially ruled out of the tournament with a back injury, he got his chance thanks to a hamstring injury suffered by Andre Fletcher just before the semi-finals. Having arrived in the country only a day-and-a-half earlier, he scored an unbeaten 51-ball 82 at the Wankhede Stadium - his home ground in the IPL - to make short work of India's total of 192 and steer West Indies into the final.

After his first Test innings, 84 not out against Pakistan, Ted Dexter was moved to predict a Test average of more than 50 - quite a millstone to hang around any young player's neck. But on his first tour, to England in 2000, Sarwan lived up to the hype by topping the averages. His footwork, which seemed to require no early trigger movements, was strikingly confident and precise. \n"", ""It was a surprise when he then produced a horror run of three runs in five innings in Australia, but against India in 2001-02 he was back to his composed best. Sarwan, who took over as Brian Lara's vice-captain in March 2003, required 28 matches and 49 innings to post his maiden Test century - 119 in December 2002 - and even then it came against the less-than-mighty Bangladeshis. As the likes of Graham Gooch and Steve Waugh can testify, the first time is often the hardest. "", 'A dream series against South Africa in 2003-04, where he averaged nearly 100 runs a Test, was followed by a lean run against England. But he returned to form in a stunning manner with an unbeaten 261 against Bangladesh in June. Then came an England tour in 2004 where he began and ended the tour on a low note, but was prolific in the middle. However, West Indian fortunes were on the ascendancy in one-dayers, as they reached the finals of the NatWest Series and then won the ICC Champions Trophy with Sarwan playing a big hand in both tournaments. ', 'Sarwan was one of the players involved in a contract dispute with WICB and missed the first Test against South Africa in 2005. On his return he scored attractive runs, but was again overlooked for the captaincy when it was handed back to Brian Lara. ', ""He didn't fare well with the bat in the 2006-07 season, averaging just 25.90 in 13 games he played till the end of the Champions Trophy. It was still a shock when he was dropped from the second Test against Pakistan in the away series in November. He returned for the third Test and sustained a foot injury which kept him out of the one-dayers against Pakistan and the tour of India."", ""Finally, the West Indies captaincy came his way following Lara's retirement. It wasn't exactly a field full of promising candidates as West Indies cricket yearned for true leadership. Injuries limited his appearances in 2007, and a friendly captaincy competition between Sarwan and Gayle continued with both players publicly supporting one another. Sarwan was Gayle's deputy on his return to the side in 2008 for the home series against Sri Lanka but the demotion did not affect his output, and he made three half-centuries and a hundred in the two Tests."", 'In the 2009 home series against England, Sarwan recorded his personal best of 291 in the first innings of the fourth Test, equalling the highest score for the West Indies made by Sir Vivian Richards. He scored his 15th Test century against England at Chester-le-Street in May of the same year but West Indies lost the series 2-0. ', 'The following year, Sarwan lost his central contract in 2010, subsequently winning damages from the West Indies Cricket Board over comments made about his attitude and fitness. He played his last Test against India in Bridgetown in July 2011. ', ""Having fallen out of international favour, he signed for English county Leicestershire for the 2012 English season and enjoyed noteworthy success in a struggling side, scoring two centuries in the Championship, another two in 40-over matches and falling short of 1,000 first-class runs largely because injury caused him to miss two matches.  He agreed to return as four-day captain in 2013 but played only half the season because of injury and West Indies' limited-overs commitments."", 'West Indies recalled him for the first time in 18 months for the limited overs side that toured Australia in early 2013, although it was an inauspicious return.

When he started his Test career at 19, without yet representing his native Jamaica in a first-class match, his composure and skill prompted comparisons - quite unfairly - with Viv Richards. His technique was near to faultless, and he exudes a bull-headed confidence - he used to skip his schoolwork on the basis that exams were irrelevant to future Test cricketers. \n', ""However, that confidence, which often overflowed into perceived arrogance, has landed him in plenty of trouble. It almost got him sent home from India late in 2002 after he defied a team curfew - but he was kept on, and responded with his a disciplined maiden Test century in Kolkata. His lack of consistency meant he remained an irregular member of the team in the 2000s, but just before his selection for the 2007 World Cup, he was drawn into a major controversy after Nagpur police alleged that he passed on match-related information to an alleged bookie ahead of an ODI against India. He was included in the World Cup squad despite the ICC's investigations into the issue, where he only briefly shone, ending the tournament by running out Brian Lara in his last international innings."", 'He was called for the World Twenty20 in South Africa in 2007, but the match-fixing allegations reared its head in 2008 when he was found guilty of ""receiving money, or benefit or other reward that could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute."" Samuels was subsequently banned for two years, at a time when West Indies desperately needed solidity in their middle-order. He returned to the West Indies Test and ODI teams in 2011, but it was only on the tour to England in 2012 that he finally showed what he was capable of. Against a top-class bowling attack in difficult conditions, Samuels scored 386 runs in five innings, with a century and three fifties, defying the England bowlers every time with his correct technique and classy strokeplay. Later that year came a highlight of his career: a gutsy, snappy 78 in the World Twenty20 final against Sri Lanka, which lifted West Indies out of a hole and to their first world title since the 1979 World Cup.', ""A month after the World T20 triumph, Samuels notched up his first Test double-century, scoring 260 against Bangladesh in Khulna. Consistency eluded him, however, as the big scores were often followed by dips in form and injuries. A facial injury suffered during the Big Bash League in January 2013 ruled him out of West Indies' limited-overs tour to Australia. He picked up a four-for on his return to international cricket against Zimbabwe but his batting form did not improve. Samuels scored just two international hundreds, both in ODIs, in the two seasons following the double-hundred and his lack of form in Tests, and competitions like the World T20, only contributed further to West Indies' struggles. As a result of his poor form, he was dropped after just one Test in the home series against New Zealand in June 2014. "", 'Samuels, who is a handy part-time offspinner, was reported for a suspect action during the second Test against India in Mumbai in November 2013, along with offspinner Shane Shillingford. Following a biomechanical analysis of his action, Samuels was barred from bowling quicker deliveries in international cricket in December 2013.']",[],71.0,127.0,7.0,3917.0,260,32.64,8219.0,47.65,7.0,24.0,537.0,32.0,28.0,0.0,207.0,196,26,5606.0,133*,32.97,7463,75.11,10,30,526,118,50.0,0.0,67.0,65,10,1611.0,89*,29.29,1386,116.23,0,10,144,69,12.0,0.0,122.0,211,12,7295,260,36.65,,,14,40,,,68.0,0.0,275.0,261,36,7652,133*,34.00,,,14,44,,,66.0,0.0,187.0,181.0,38.0,4571.0,106*,31.96,3876.0,117.93,2.0,29.0,388.0,191.0,45.0,0.0,71.0,69,4392,2445,41.0,4/13,6/50,59.63,3.34,107.1,1,0,0,207.0,134,5091,4127,89.0,3/12,3/12,46.37,4.86,57.2,0,0,0,67.0,30,479,622,22.0,3/23,3/23,28.27,7.79,21.7,0,0,0,122.0,,7432,3909,71,5/87,,55.05,3.15,104.6,,1,0,275.0,,7003,5464,135,4/21,4/21,40.47,4.68,51.8,2,0,0,187.0,92,1636,1957,70,3/10,3/10,27.95,7.17,23.3,0,0,0,False,True,False,True
