In full flow, he was a sight for sore eyes. His avarice for runs matched that of the Australian legend, and that was why he was dubbed the Asian Bradman. High praise indeed for there have been many greats but none matches the aura of the Don.  \n', ""There was not a touch of arrogance about Zaheer's batting but of lyrical, fluent movement, his innings memorable for a refined, effortless beauty. His strength was precision and timing. He had the ability to go on back and front foot with equal facility, on occasions moving from backward to forward or vice versa during the course of one stroke and yet send the ball crashing to the fence. A high back-lift gave him a touch of elegance, and combined with powerful and supple wrists guiding the ball into the gaps on both sides of the wicket, he scored a very high proportion of his runs in boundaries. When the going was good, he seemed like a maestro at work, his artistry, his elegance leaving connoisseurs awestruck. "", ""Zaheer's first big score came in England, a double hundred, 274 to be precise, at Edgbaston in only his second Test. With that innings, not only did he prove the pundits wrong, who thought that his technique and high backlift would make him highly suspect against the seaming ball, it also heralded the arrival of a new international star. Such was his mastery, so profound his concentration that he never seemed like getting out. He may have gone on and on, when sheer exhaustion got him; by the time he got out he had batted for nine hours and 10 minutes."", 'Many counties lined up to recruit this lean and bespectacled youth, but he opted for Gloucestershire, a less fashionable choice but one which he did not regret. He never switched to another county, playing for Gloucester right to the end, making runs year on year in a huge pile, well in excess of 1,000 almost every season, 2,544 in one glorious Indian summer of 1976 and another 2305 in 1981. ', 'Having already scored another double hundred (240) in the Oval Test in 1974 and some big scores on the Australian tour of 1976-77 including 101 at Adelaide, he was signed up by the Kerry Packer circus, which resulted in his missing two rubbers against England. When the Packer bunch was welcomed back to the fold for the Indian series, the first between the two in 18 years, Zaheer was at his majestic best, putting to sword the feared Indian spin quartet to notch scores of 176, 96 and 235 in successive innings. His tally of 583 runs in a short rubber was then a world record. ', 'The only Asian to have made a century of centuries in first class cricket to date, he really had a Bradmanesque appetite for runs. Nothing reflects this better than his making a century in each innings on eight occasions in a first class match, a world record. All the more amazing is the fact that in four out of these eight, he made a double hundred and a hundred. His 100th hundred, predictably, a double hundred (215) against India in the 1982-83 Lahore Test was followed by two more Test hundreds in that series. ', 'That was the last of his great series, and though he got the captaincy, which he so desired when Imran Khan got his famous shin injury, he only played one major innings, an unbeaten 168, again at Lahore, again against India. Never really comfortable against genuine pace, but then nobody really is, by then age was catching up fast and his reflexes had deteriorated a great deal. ', 'For one who was the epitome of grace in batting, his exit was rather unseemly as he opted out of the last Test of his career at Karachi in 1985-86 against Sri Lanka, not allowing himself a proper farewell. Zaheer blamed it on senior players, on Imran Khan in an indirect way. But perhaps he did so in a fit of pique, because having announced his retirement from Test cricket, he still wanted to remain active in the one-day version of the game. And the selectors, certainly with Imran prompting them, would have none of it. Whatever the reason, none would dispute that Zaheer deserved a better send off than he got.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1972'],78.0,124,11,5062.0,274,44.79,,,12,20,,22,34.0,0.0,62.0,60,6,2572.0,123,47.62,3033,84.80,7,13,,,16.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,459.0,768,92,34843,274,51.54,,,108,158,,,278.0,0.0,323.0,309,33,11240,158*,40.72,,,19,72,,,78.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78.0,14,370,132,3.0,2/21,2/26,44.0,2.14,123.3,0,0,0,62.0,12,280,223,7.0,2/26,2/26,31.85,4.77,40.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,459.0,,2582,1146,30,5/15,,38.20,2.66,86.0,,1,0,323.0,,828,689,16,3/48,3/48,43.06,4.99,51.7,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Born in Southend, but bred in Western Australia, Mullally began with WA, had brief spells with Hampshire and Victoria, before moving to Leicestershire.

What he observed - not just from his own side's lacklustre display, but the inspiration provided by Brendon McCullum's New Zealand side - convinced him an entirely new approach was necessary in England's cricket with a policy of No Fear (and No Retribution) at its heart. It required a man of strong will not just to say it, but to implement it, but Morgan did so, seeking to fashion a side that would play with courage and be impervious to pressure or criticism. \n"", 'The revival he led was dramatic. Going into the 2019 World Cup year, England were rated not only the No. 1 ODI side but had set a host of new records, including the two highest scores made in the format. Morgan, relentlessly committed to this bold style of play on good days and bad, was at the heart of the transformation.', ""Morgan's self-sufficiency and independent thought has caused him to tread a path that has not always been popular with English administrators. He preferred the IPL to county cricket long before it was ECB policy. Although he strove for a while to play for England in all three formats, he played the last of his 16 Tests in 2012 and his interest in the longer format appeared to wane once he recognised he had little chance of a recall. He didn't play any first-class cricket in 2016 or 2017 and averaged 11 when he returned for half-a-dozen games in 2018. A somewhat private man, he is respected by his players for his inner strength, cool temperament and tactical nous but remains largely a closed book to those outside the dressing room."", 'Once the selectors had decided to dispense with Alastair Cook just before Christmas in 2014, Morgan, the regular ODI deputy, was the most obvious candidate.  But his elevation coincided with one of his worst periods of form since switching to England from Ireland. A left-hander who quickly built a reputation for inventive and audacious strokeplay, Morgan also possessed the patience and power of shot to be a natural ""finisher"" - a role England had struggled to fill for a decade. In some ways, he was a prototype, encouraging the English game to adopt a more inventive approach only subsequently to face up to the challenge that he might be overtaken by more highly-powered models.', 'As a young man in Dublin, Morgan was recognised as a cricketer of rare unorthodox talent, who plays the ball exceptionally late and was adroit both at sweeping and reverse sweeping. Time at Dulwich College only hardened his desire to play for England, which he never tried to hide back in Ireland.', ""Morgan made his Ireland debut at the age of 16, making 99 against Scotland in Ayr, and was soon signed by Middlesex, who gave him his debut a week after his 19th birthday. He floundered in the 2007 World Cup: batting at No. 3, he made only 91 runs in nine games. But he soon established himself in the Middlesex line up, especially in limited overs cricket, and his switch to England was long anticipated. After securing Ireland's qualification for the 2011 World Cup, in April 2009, he was called up by England, thereby denying Ireland the chances to pick him in the World T20 and beyond."", ""At the age of 23, he shot to prominence on the back of two match-winning innings against South Africa. First was a 34-ball 67 in the Champions Trophy in September 2009, followed two months later with an unbeaten 45-ball 85 in the opening Twenty20 of England's tour of South Africa. His bold approach and crisp hitting evoked comparisons with Kevin Pietersen."", 'His growing stature was confirmed when he was the only England player to be awarded a new contract at the auction for the third season of the IPL in January 2010. He was signed for $220,000 by Bangalore, where he joined England team-mate Pietersen. But he failed to make an impression and was soon left on the bench. He returned to his best for England in the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean as his powerful shot-making and coolness under pressure helped England to their first triumph in global limited-overs events. With three ODI hundreds that year, his first for England coming against Bangladesh in Dhaka, his reputation was soaring.', ""Despite a modest first-class record he was rewarded with a surprise call-up to the Test side for England's first Test of the 2010 summer, against Bangladesh. Walking out to bat at 258 for 4, he could not have asked for a gentler introduction and showed enough confidence to pick up his first Test boundary with a reverse-sweep. With the retirement of Paul Collingwood, a permanent space opened up in England's Test side. Centuries against Pakistan (2010) and India (2011) represented the high points."", 'But a disastrous tour of the UAE in early 2012 effectively ended his Test career. With Joe Root making his debut before the end of the year, he never returned to the Test side.', ""He remained an indispensable member of the one-day side, though. And while there were prolonged fallow periods - from September 2012, for example, he went a year and 17 innings without an ODI half-century and, by the time he was appointed captain, he had scored one fifty in 19 innings - he produced enough outstanding innings (not least a match-defining century against Ireland) to retain his place. Going into the 2019 World Cup, he was England's record run-scorer in ODIs."", 'While his captaincy record at domestic level was not inspiring - Middlesex won five out of 22 limited-overs matches under him in 2014 - and the 2015 World Cup campaign was painfully poor, progress was fast once England embraced a new coaching regime (Peter Moores was sacked in May 2015) and bolder selections. A watershed series against New Zealand saw England, so hesitant and mediocre at the World Cup, pass 350 three times in 10 days in registering their highest ever ODI total (408-9; subsequently overtaken) and their highest ever second-innings total (365-9; also subsequently overtaken). A new template had been set.', ""Such was Morgan's statute within the side, he survived his decision to skip the Bangladesh tour in 2016 on security grounds - the players had been given a choice whether to tour, though the impression remained the management had rather hoped the captain would lead the way - and oversaw a spell of 12 bi-lateral series wins out of 13, including nine in a row broken only by an aberrational defeat against Scotland. If highlights were a 4-1 victory in Australia in early 2018 and a 5-0 whitewash at home later in the year, it was all a prelude to the 2019 World Cup which will surely define both his and his side's legacy.\n"", '\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2003, 2004']",16.0,24,1,700.0,130,30.43,1278,54.77,2,3,77,6,11.0,0.0,217.0,203,29,6813.0,124*,39.15,7592,89.73,12,43,575,182,77.0,0.0,80.0,78,15,1753.0,85*,27.82,1347,130.14,0,9,131,78,35.0,0.0,99.0,164,16,4912,209*,33.18,9649,50.90,11,23,,,75.0,1.0,345.0,319,44,10667,161,38.78,11850,90.01,20,64,,,116.0,0.0,267.0,253,34,5595,90,25.54,4378,127.79,0,28,436,238,126.0,0.0,16.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,217.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,80.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,99.0,,102,90,2,2/24,2/24,45.00,5.29,51.0,0,0,0,345.0,,42,49,0,-,-,-,7.00,-,0,0,0,267.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

He was born in the Lydenburg District, Transvaal, on January 20, 1886, and so was only 37 years of age at the time of his death. His education was received at Green and Sea Point High School, Cape Town, and his earliest big success on the cricket-field was an innings of 180 for Pretoria v. Potchefstroom. He was a great batsman, having many strokes and a strong defence, and a good field, but he never visited England. He toured Australia, however, in 1910-11, and played innings of 150 at Sydney and 105 at Adelaide in the Test matches. His first really big game was in 1905-6 for Pretoria against England, but he did not begin to come to the front until three years later. In Test matches against both Australia and England he commenced 32 innings, was twice not out and, with the 150 mentioned as his highest effort, scored 985 runs with an average of 32.83. (In one of the games with Australia--at Johannesburg in 1921-2--he was dismissed in an unusual manner, a splinter from his bat being removed by a ball from E. A. Macdonald and dislodging a bail.) When he made 176 not out for Transvaal v. England at Pretoria in 1909-10, he and L. A. Stricker (101) put up 215 for the first wicket. Twice in the Tests of 1913-14, too, he and H. W. Taylor were responsible for excellent opening partnerships, the pair making 153 together at Johannesburg and 129 at Port Elizabeth: Zulch\'s innings were respectively 82 and 60 and Taylor\'s 70 and 87. In the Test at Cape Town four seasons earlier Zulch had carried his bat through the innings for 43. In other great matches in his native land he scored 112 not out for Transvaal v. Border at Cape Town in 1908-9--he and A. Difford (91) made 190 for the first wicket, 168 for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower\'s XI. v. Rhodesia at Bulawayo in 1909-10, and 135 for South Africa v. Australia Imperial Forces at Johannesburg in 1919-20. In his seven innings whilst on tour with a Transvaal XI in 1920-1, he made 6 and 64 v. Border, 171 v. Grahamstown, 124 v. Eastern province, 76 v.

Unable to gain a place for his native Nottinghamshire, he moved to Surrey, where he learnt much from George Lohmann. By the early 1890s he was one of the finest bowlers in England, bowling at a brisk fast medium, with a high action and pronounced body swing, and clever variation of pace. His specialty was the break-back, often pitching outside off but pounding into the batsman\'s thigh or passing over leg stump. He also generated speed off the pitch (or appeared to do so), and had a slower ball ""of almost sinful deceit"". A good bat, with 15 first-class hundreds, he tended to ignore his batting in favour of bowling, but did enough to be classed as a genuine allrounder, averaging 21.9 in first-class cricket. \n', 'Albert Knight, his contemporary, wrote of him ""Lockwood would break back and nip a piece of one\'s thigh away, looking at one the while and wondering why the blind gods should waste such a delivery on mere flesh""', 'His career started a downslide with a disastrous tour of Australia in 1894-95, where he performed poorly on the field, and was accident prone off it, injuring a shoulder, nearly drowning, and severely cutting a hand when a soda syphon exploded. His miseries were compounded on his return when in a short period both his wife and one of his children died, and he turned to drink. His form suffered badly, and by 1897 he was out of the Surrey side. Surrey persuaded him to pledge temperance and he made a remarkable recovery, taking 134 wickets in 1898, and returning to the Test team, playing until the amazing 5th Test in 1902, where, amongst the legendary exploits of Jessop. Hirst, and Rhodes his five second-innings wickets are nearly forgotten. He had a brief reacquaintance with his drinking problems in 1901, when again he lost form after his action was questioned, and his benefit was completely rained out. Careful handling by Surrey took him through to his retirement in 1904. He returned to his native Nottinghamshire, and was a common sight at Trent Bridge in his retirement.', '\nWilliam Henry Lockwood, the famous fast bowler, died at his home, Radford, Nottingham, on April 26, at the age of 64. He had been in failing health for about five years. On his day one of the finest fast bowlers the game of cricket has ever known, Lockwood had a somewhat chequered career. Born at Old Radford, Notts, on March 25, 1868, he was given a trial for Notts in 1886, but accomplished nothing of note and in the following year he accepted an engagement on the ground staff at Kennington Oval. He duly qualified for Surrey and although Notts were anxious to secure his services in 1889, he preferred to stay with his adopted county, and that season signaled his association with Surrey by an innings of 83 against Notts in the August Bank Holiday match at the Oval.', 'Not until two years later did he make his mark as a bowler, his great performance that summer being eleven wickets for 40 runs against Kent at the Oval, but in 1892 when Surrey had George Lohmann and Tom Richardson as well as Lockwood, the last-named headed the averages for all matches, taking 168 wickets for less than twelve and a half runs apiece. Lockwood continued a great bowler during the next two seasons but, going out to Australia in 1894-95, he failed deplorably and, on his return home, went down the hill so steadily that in 1897 he lost his place in the Surrey team.', 'Happily in the ensuing winter he was at great pains to get himself fit, and in 1898 obtained 134 wickets and scored nearly a thousand runs in first-class matches. He remained a splendid bowler for several years after this, but finally dropped out of the Surrey team in 1904.', ""In 1902 he appeared for England against Australia in four of the five Test matches, and in the contest at Manchester, securing eleven wickets for 76 runs, accomplished one of the greatest bowling performances ever witnessed. To begin with, the pitch proved so soft that not until the score reached 129 was Lockwood given a trial but still, in an innings of 299, he disposed of six batsmen for 48, the last five wickets falling for 43 runs. In Australia's second innings Lockwood got rid of Trumper, Hill and Duff while the score was reaching 10. Fred Tate, at deep square leg, missing Darling off Braund the fourth wicket, which should have gone down at 16, did not fall until 64. For all that Lockwood dominated the game, taking five wickets for 28 and the tourists were all out for 86. England had only 124 to make but a night's heavy rain placed batsmen at a big disadvantage and Australia, despite Lockwood's magnificent work, won by three runs."", ' Lockwood took no such long run as his famous colleague, Tom Richardson, and did not appear quite so fast through the air, but when he was at the top of his form, no one ever came off the pitch much faster than he or--with his off-break also a distinguishing quality of his bowling--was more difficult to play under conditions favourable to batting. He had, too, at his command a slow ball which in his early days he sent down without any perceptible change of delivery. After he came back in 1898 he did not bowl this ball quite as well as before but it was still a very useful part of his equipment.', ""In addition to being one of the most famous bowlers of his generation, Lockwood was also a first-rate batsman and, had he not been compelled to concentrate his energies upon the taking of wickets would, no doubt, have gained high rank as a run-getter. Among his many triumphs was one for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's in 1902, when in addition to taking nine wickets for less than twelve runs apiece, he put together an innings of 100.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1899'],12.0,16,3,231.0,52*,17.76,,,0,1,,0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,363.0,531,45,10673,165,21.96,,,15,48,,,140.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12.0,18,1973,883,43.0,7/71,11/76,20.53,2.68,45.8,2,5,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,363.0,,52121,25246,1376,9/59,,18.34,2.90,37.8,,121,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Tony Lock was an aggressive, attacking left-arm spinner, who complemented ideally the subtleties of Jim Laker's off-spin when Surrey were winning the County Championship every year from 1952 to 1958 and England regained, then retained, the Ashes; their names were twinned in cricket lore in a way usually associated with opening batsmen and fast bowlers. The final phase of his playing days saw him as a more orthodox slow bowler, relying on guile and flight as much as spin, and as a driving captain of Western Australia and Leicestershire. \n"", ""Recommended to Surrey by H. D. G. Leveson Gower, Lock made his Championship debut in 1946, a week after his 17th birthday, against Kent at The Oval, and marked it with a hot catch at backward short leg off Alf Gover--the first of 830 in his career. In 1948, while doing National Service, he took six for 43 at Pontypridd, on a pitch that afforded little assistance to bowlers, when the Combined Services beat Glamorgan, that summer's champions, and back at The Oval in 1949 he ousted the recently capped South Australian, John McMahon, as the left-arm spinner. Next year, when Surrey shared the Championship with Lancashire, his contribution was 72 wickets at 22.38 and his reward--belatedly in his opinion--was his county cap. In 1951 he took 100 wickets for the first time. But the 1952 "", "" said he would struggle to gain higher honours unless he imparts more spin to his leg-break. After two winters working at an indoor school in Croydon, he emerged with a lower trajectory that produced vicious spin at around medium-pace. Now the ball spat from leg stump to hit the top of the off, or spun devilishly and jumped shoulder high. Gone were his original high-arm action and the classical spin bowler's loop, victims, it was said, of a low beam in those Croydon nets that had forced him to drop his arm. His new method was far more effective but produced mutterings about its legitimacy. In 1952 he was called up for the Old Trafford Test against India, and took four for 36 in the second innings. But a week later, when Surrey played the tourists at The Oval, he was no-balled three times in two overs for throwing his quicker ball. Raising the beam at the Croydon nets helped restore something of Lock's original action, but he was again called for throwing in the West Indies in 1953-54 and for a time he refrained from bowling his faster ball. It was this delivery which drew the legendary lament from Doug Insole, the Essex captain, to the square-leg umpire when he was bowled by Lock in fading light: How was I out then--run out?"", ""Although picked for the First Test against Australia in 1953, he wore his spinning finger raw the day after selection and played in only the last two Tests. At Headingley, his resolute batting served England better than his bowling, but at The Oval his return of 21-9-45-5 on the third afternoon, along with Laker's four for 75, was instrumental in Australia's dismissal for 162. Next day, England regained the Ashes for the first time since 1932-33, and in the spring "", ' named him as one of the Five Cricketers of the Year.', ""It was a different story at Old Trafford in 1956, when Laker took 19 Australian wickets while Lock had to be content with the left-over, and economical match figures of one for 106 from 69 overs. He had enjoyed his own ten-wicket return three weeks earlier. After taking six for 29 in Kent's first innings at Blackheath, he demolished their second innings with figures of 29.1-18-54-10. In 1957 he had a match return of 11 for 48 from 37.4 overs in the Oval Test against West Indies, and in the wet summer of 1958 he was utterly ruthless against the weak New Zealanders, taking 34 wickets at just 7.47 apiece."", ""On overseas tours, he was not quite the same threat, except on the soft pitches of New Zealand in 1958-59. There he took 13 Test wickets at less than nine apiece, but also saw himself on film, and was genuinely shocked by the imperfection of his action. Had I known I was throwing I wouldn't have bowled that way, he said later. So he remodelled his action once more, but he still took his 100 wickets every year until 1962, his penultimate year at The Oval. He was no longer such a fearsome proposition in England but emerged as a better bowler overseas. He was the leading wicket-taker on MCC's tour of India and Pakistan in 1961-62 and, when he was omitted from the side for Australia in 1962-63, he went instead to play for Western Australia, where he took 32 wickets in the Sheffield Shield and immediately became a fixture. In 1966-67, he was the first post-war bowler to take 50 or more Shield wickets in a season. He assumed the captaincy in 1967-68 and led Western Australia to only their second Shield. Meanwhile, he had been recruited by Leicestershire for mid-week games in 1965, and captained them in the next two seasons with such infectious enthusiasm that they rose from 14th in 1965 to second in 1967, then their highest position in the Championship."", ""There was an unexpected twist to this phase of his career when he was called to the Caribbean to replace the injured Titmus in 1967-68 and played in the last two Tests. In the final one, at Georgetown, his belligerent 89 in England's first innings surpassed his previous highest first-class score, and put England on course for the draw that gave them the series. He was, Trevor Bailey wrote, the ideal person to walk out to the crease when the match seemed lost."", ' Lock continued as a coach in Perth and from 1987 to 1991 was cricket professional at Mill Hill School in north London. His final years were overshadowed by two allegations of sexual abuse involving young girls, the second only months before his death from cancer. Cleared of both charges, he was nevertheless forced to sell some of his cricket memorabilia to meet his legal costs, and while the second court case was pending his wife died of a heart attack. He said bitterly just before he died that he would be remembered only for the charges and not for his cricket, but he will be proved wrong.

Yet to see his wicketkeeping at its most spectacular, you had to catch him standing up to Derek Underwood on a rain-affected pitch for Kent in county cricket. Underwood, left-hand, whose stock ball was about the pace of Shane Warne's flipper, habitually bowled even quicker when a crusting pitch not only added to his spin but could produce a variation of two feet or more in bounce. Most of the time, despite the obvious problems, Knott would take the ball so nimbly he might have been keeping wicket in the indoor nets. As a batsman he learned to put a high price on his wicket, and in only his fourth Test, at Georgetown in 1967-68, he made 73 not out in four hours and helped Colin Cowdrey save the series. He could attack or defend with equal skill as the position of the match demanded: with five Test hundreds to his name, he was a genuine all rounder.

One is a flamboyant left-handed opener for England's one-day side, who exploits fielding restrictions in the first 15 overs by slapping the ball over mid-on and carving it through point. The other is a tentative Test player, fallible outside off stump and to the straight, full-length delivery when he plays round his front pad and falls away to the off side. His two best Test innings (113 v Pakistan, Headingley in 1996, and 96 in the flippin'-murdered-'em draw v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo in 1996-97) seemed to set him up, but he was dropped after a poor series in New Zealand that winter, and has won only five more caps, four of them in 2000. Knight was harshly left out of the World Cup team in 1999, but seemed set to make amends in 2003 after several impressive displays in the VB Series, which led seasoned Australian observers to wonder why on earth he wasn't a Test regular.  But after England's failure in the World Cup, he called time on his international one-day career - but not Tests - to enable him to concentrate on leading Warwickshire.  Knight, who began his career at Essex but moved to Warwickshire in 1995, is a world-class fielder - whether at third slip, in the gully, at short midwicket or as a cover sweeper - and an outgoing, hard-to-suppress team man.

Solid in defence and a crisp strokeplayer, Mead was extremely prolific for England too. He averaged 49 over 17 Tests, including an unbeaten 182 at The Oval against the rampant 1921 Australians. He played his last Test at 41, but went blind later in life and died in Boscombe in 1958.', ' \n', 'by John Arlott', '\nHe was never much concerned with records.  But, pressed to choose one  for  himself,  I have little doubt that he would have picked that which, in fact, stands to his name - with no indication that it   will  ever  be  wrested  from  him.   That record is for the greatest number of runs scored by any player for one team in  the entire history of cricket.  The number is 48,892, scored by Philp Mead for Hampshire.', 'The figure is staggering.  He would have liked us  to  make  that comment.  he would have pointed out, though, that he did not only bat for Hampshire; that, in all first-class matches, he  totalled 55,061 runs, with 153 centuries and an average of 47.67.  But for four seasons lost to the First  World  War,  he must  have   made at least  8,000  more.  His first-class career is given officially\nas from 1905 to 1936: but in 1905, while he was  qualifying   for Hampshire, he played in only one match.  so his runs were made in 27 seasons:  an average of more than 2,000 runs a year. We  may  adduce  one  more  piece of evidence about him before we dispense with ""damned dots"" - Mead\'s  average  in  Test   cricket\nagainst   Australia  (51.87 in,  surprisingly  enough, only seven Tests, and jthose spread over seventeen years) is higher than his figure for all play.', 'No one who saw Philip Mead bat will ever forget him.  At the fall of  Hampshire\'s  second  wicket he would emerge from the pavilion with a peculiar rolling gait, his sloping  shoulders, wide   hips and  heavy,  bowed legs giving him the bottom-heavy appearance of those lead-based, won\'t-fall-down dolls of our childhood.  Leathery  complexioned,  with  a  long nose, a wry expression and eyes which seemed always to be screwed up against the sun,  he  had  a\nsemi-comic  air:   but  he  was  a  very serious batsman.  At the crease, he went through precisely the same  ritual  before  every ball  was  bowled to him.  First he touched his cap four times to short-leg (whether that fieldsman was  there  or  not)  then   he tapped  his  bat four times in the crease and, finally, took four small, shuffling strides up to it.   Then,  and  only  then,  the bowler  might  bowl:   if he tried to do so before the ritual was\ncompleted, Philip stepped away from  his  stumps  and,  when  the bowler  stopped, started the whole procedure over again.  He wore out some dozens of cap-peaks in his time, and - ""I know it  sometimes   held them  up;  but is used to put some of the hasty ones off, and I shouldn\'t have felt happy if I hadn\'t done it.""', 'His batting gave a superficial impression of  clumsiness,  accentuated  perhaps  by  the  fact  that he was left-handed.  But his footwork was so neat that he seemed always in position, his  balance  was  utterly  perfect  and  his  timing so delicate that he seemed only to need to stroke the ball to send if for four.   One of  his maxims was:  ""No point in trying to bash the case off it: just hit it hard enough for four.""  He had all the  strokes  and, though  he relished the cover-drive (""that\'s everyone\'s favourite stroke, really""), he never favoured any to the extent of  playing it to the wrong ball.', 'The best critics of batsmen - the bowlers of four countries,  who opposed  him  over three decades - described him, with remarkable unanimity, as ""the hardest of them all to get out"".  That was the way  he  wanted  to  be.  Alec Kennedy, who knoew him better than anyone, thought the most remarkable facet of his batting was that he  made  so many of his big scores on turning wickets.  Yet Alec added, ""But he was as fine a player of fast bowling  as  I   ever\nsaw.""  That judgment was borne out when Mead stopped the terrifying progress of Gregory and McDonald, the Australian fast bowlers of 1921, in the fifth Test with an innings of 182 (not out), then the highest score ever made by an English  batsman  against  Australia in England.', 'There probably will be no end - and can be no clear decision - to the  debate  as  to  whether  Philip Mead or Frank Woolley was the greater left-hand batsman.  There is no doubt  that Woolley   was the   greater  stylist, and he scored more runs: but Mead had the higher average - over all, and against Australia -  and,  by  his standards, that would be conclusive.', 'This man, Charles Philip Mead - ""Phil"" - was  the  ultimate  run-hungry  batsman.   Indeed, at times it seemed that he was not interested in batting but only in runs.  Like the Sikhs, who   only draw  their  knives to draw blood, he did not care to pick up his bat except to oppose a bowler for runs which counted.  He  had  a rooted   aversion  to  batting in the nets: and, when others took pre-season practice, he would do his utmost  to  evade  it,  with\nwords, ""You may lead in May, but I shall catch you in June."" Once, when he voiced dissatisfaction with his timing in a century which was his first innings of the season, Alec Kennedy pertinently enquired when he had last held a bat in his hands.  ""Last  Scarborough Festival,"" was the the answer.', 'Mead was consciously, and  quite  downrightly,  a  \'professional\'  cricketer:   he  executed  his craft for the best living he could get (and that was fairly meagre); and he would not, I fancy, have objected  to  being  described as a mercenary.  Hampshire, in his day, paid talent money to their batsmen strictly on  a  basis  of fifty-run  increments, irrespective of their effect on the match. So, an innings of 49 went worthless financially:  one  of  99  no\nbetter  rewarded than 50.  Hence, more than one Hampshire batsman was run out when Philip had the strike on  49  or  99:   and  one famous  left-arm  bowler,  an old opponent recalls the many times when Mead steered him through the short-leg fieldsmen and, as  he completed  the  stroke, set off for a run with the words, ""That\'s another ton of coal for the winter.""', 'It is not unusual to hear it said that Mead was  a  slow  scorer; but  the  records do not bear out that argument.  He could ', ' slow because his movement to the ball was so unhurried,  and  because he never seemed to swing the bat:  he came by his runs at a steady but unobtrusive  rate.   Perhaps the  illusion  was   best demonstrated,  in  all  innocence, by an old Hampshire member who said to me, ""Of  course  Mead  was so  dull:   I  once  saw   him\nstonewall  nearly  all day for 280!""  In truth, he scored as fast as he could, consonant with his assessment  of  safety.   I  have called  him run-hungry, but it might be more accurate to describe him as a run addict.  Many batsmen, when they have made a century -  or  150  or  200 - will take risks and, in effect, throw away their wickets.  But the more runs Philip Mead made, the  more  he\nwanted.    In 1912,  when  Hampshire  were  in  a losing position against Warwickshire, he saved them in the  second  innings  with 207  not  out,  scored  in  exactly  three  hours.  The next day, against Sussex at Portsmouth, he made a century before lunch and, when  Bob Relf caught him at cover for 194 in mid-afternoon, came into the dressing-room with the words,  ""I didn\'t  get  over   it properly.""', 'Once in scoring vein he would go on and on,  combative,  acquisitive,  never losing poise, power or patience.  Between early June and mid-July in 1921 he scored 1,601 runs; a year later  he  made 1192  in  seven consecutive innings: in 1927, from the end of May to late June, he played fourteen innings (four of them  not  out) for  1,257  runs (an average of 125.70):  he was then forty years old.', 'For several years before he retired he was so crippled by rheumatism  and  backache that he could barely stoop to lace his boots. But still the runs came  and  he  still  caught almost   anything within his reach at slip, though he would not care to run for the snicks that scuttled past him.  To the end, even on  the  eve  of his  blindness  - such an ironically savage blow to fall upon one of his keen eye for the ball - he batted  with  monumental  skill\nand soundness.', 'It was Mead\'s dishearteningly broad bat that changed Maurice Tate from  a  slow  offspinner  to  a  pace  bowler.  In desperation, against that unwavering defence, one afternoon at Horsham,   Tate gathered  all  his  energy and flung down the first quick ball he had ever bowled in all his life.  It pitched on Mead\'s off-stump, made  hurry off the pitch and flicked away the leg bail.  So Tate described it; thirty years later, Mead, unprompted, confirmed the\ndescription.   ""A  pretty  good ball, Philip?""  ""Not half: a real trimmer:  mind, I don\'t say I wouldn\'t have played it if I\'d  expected him to bowl fast ...  but, yes, it was a good \'un.""', '""Did you say anything to him, Philip?""', '""What?  Me?  \'Course I didn\'t.  I never encouraged bowlers.""', ""That might  be  Philip  Mead's  epitaph  as  a   cricketer:  pre-eminently  among all the men who ever wielded a bat, he never encouraged bowlers.""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1912'],17.0,26,2,1185.0,182*,49.37,,,4,3,,0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,814.0,1340,185,55061,280*,47.67,,,153,258,,,675.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,814.0,,18457,9613,277,7/18,,34.70,3.12,66.6,,5,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

In the 1950s PBH May - the initials were part of the style of the man - came to represent the ', ' of English batsmanship and sportsmanship. He was tall and handsome with a batting style that was close to classical, and he was the hero of a generation of schoolboys. To his contemporaries at Charterhouse he was a heroic figure much earlier: from a very young age it was clear that he was going to play for England and he glided towards greatness in an effortless-looking manner. \n', "" Peter May was born at Reading on December 31, 1929. He was an instinctive cricketer, though there was no background of the game in his family. When he was 13, the headmaster of Charterhouse barred him from the First XI for his own good, but as a 14-year-old in 1944 he made 108 against Harrow, an innings that had an extraordinary impact on the school. In four years in the school First XI he made 1,794 runs, averaging 54.36. He was advised, but not all that much, by the former England player George Geary. By 1947, his last year at school, he was clearly the best schoolboy batsman in the country, scoring an unbeaten 183 against Eton and 148 and 146 in the representative matches at Lord's."", ""He then had to do two years' national service as Writer May of the Royal Navy - the scorecard abbreviation Wtr puzzling at least one MCC member who thought he must be the mess waiter. By his second year, his clerical duties were being heavily interspersed with cricket and in 1949 he played enough to come third in the national averages behind Hardstaff and Hutton. That autumn he went up to Cambridge: in 1950 their batting side was as strong as any in the country and he was not immediately dominant, but he scored an unbeaten 227 against Hampshire, stepped into the Surrey team and quickly won his county cap."", 'By 1951 he had made enough runs in every type of cricket - including a century for the Gentlemen- to be picked for the Fourth Test against South Africa at Headingley. He scored 138, an innings that seemed like a revelation. He played in all four Tests against India in 1952 and, though he was dropped for the three middle Ashes Tests of 1953, he returned to score 39 and 37, important in context, at the Oval and was picked for the West Indies tour, where he made his second Test century, a far more dogged 135 on a matting pitch at Port-of-Spain to earn a draw.', 'This secured May\'s place once and for all, and he became a crucial member of two of the most successful teams English cricket has ever seen: Surrey, who won the Championship every year between 1952 and 1958, and an England team that never lost a series in the same period. May adapted his method and his mental approach to Test cricket and moved from being a promising batsman to a great one. Once Gubby Allen saw him get out at Fenner\'s and muttered: ""That was the most unconscious stroke I have ever seen."" After his Headingley century Allen sent him a telegram: ""Charge of unconsciousness unconditionally withdrawn"".', ""In Australia in 1954-55, May was Hutton's vice-captain, and the following year, when Hutton became ill, inherited the leadership. He captained England in 41 Tests, still a record despite the later growth of Test cricket, and was an unchallenged figure of authority. England won 20 of those Tests and lost only ten. May's stature as a batsman increased each year, even on the indifferent pitches of 1956. In the First Test at Edgbaston against West Indies in 1957, he scored 285 not out, sharing a stand of 411, England's highest ever, with Colin Cowdrey, saving the match and blunting Sonny Ramadhin's mastery of English batsmen once and for all. England went on to win the series 3-0. In 1958, in the wettest, most bowler-friendly summer of the century, he averaged almost 64, 17 more than any other batsman. In both these years, he followed on where Stuart Surridge had left off in 1956 and captained Surrey to the Championship."", ""That was May's apogee. England went to Australia in 1958-59 as hot favourites, but were met by bowlers widely suspected of throwing, and slumped to a 4-0 defeat. May was greatly upset by newspaper criticism of the presence on tour of his fiancée, Virginia Gilligan, especially when one report said they had been secretly married. They actually married that April, and from then on his enthusiasm for the game semed to wane. He missed much of the 1959 season with an abscess, which also forced him home from the West Indies tour that winter. It was 1961 before he returned to cricket and, when he was bowled round his legs by Richie Benaud at Old Trafford, his dismissal sealed the fate of the Ashes. Three weeks later he played his last Test and in 1962 effectively retired from first-class cricket, though there was always the hope, in other minds, that he might return, and "", ' delayed its retirement tribute until 1971.', "" May became an insurance broker and underwriter at Lloyd's and concentrated on his growing family: four girls, all of them sharing their mother's love of horses, which their father, though no horseman, happily took on. For many years his cricketing involvement was low-profile, though he served as a Test selector from 1965 to 1968, and was president of MCC in 1980-81. However, in 1982 he agreed to return to the limelight by becoming chairman of selectors with a specific brief to get a grip on the players' behaviour. He never gained a rapport with a new generation of cricketers and did not seem to have much disposition to choose between them. Had he stuck to the original plan and retired after the 1985 Ashes series, his reputation would have been largely undamaged, but he stayed on until 1988, working through four captains in the last summer alone. By the end, players were being picked and dropped with bewildering rapidity."", ' England were less strong relative to other countries in the 1980s than in the 1950s. Both as a batsman and as a captain, May had the advantage that the best bowlers were nearly always on his side. His failure against Heine and Adcock in South Africa in 1956-57 has led some to wonder whether he could have coped with the sustained battering that modern batsmen receive. But, 18 months earlier in England, he dealt with the same bowlers so effectively that he was close to a century in every match. Richie Benaud, perhaps his most formidable opponent, called him not merely the greatest English batsman to emerge since the war - which is the conventional judgment - but the only great one. As a captain, May was a hard but unfailingly courteous competitor. He was not an imaginative tactician but his resources meant this was not a serious disadvantage. He was helped too by the presence of a great chairman of selectors in Gubby Allen.', ' Peter May will be remembered best as a batsman, upright in everything he did, especially the on-drive which, famously, he perfected as a schoolboy. In 66 Tests he scored 4,537 runs at 46.77; in first-class cricket he scored 27,592 runs at 51.00 with 282 catches. He scored 85 centuries, his early retirement preventing him becoming the first amateur since WG Grace to score a hundred hundreds. His gifts were sublime, indeed mysterious, and he bore them with honour, modesty and distinction. The fear that we will never see his like again meant his early death was felt all the more keenly.']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1952'],66.0,106,9,4537.0,285*,46.77,,,13,22,,12,42.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,388.0,618,77,27592,285*,51.00,,,85,127,,,282.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,66.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,388.0,,102,49,0,-,-,-,2.88,-,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

For many seasons he kept wicket for Warwickshire, the Players and England, and in thirty-one Tests against Australia he obtained eighty-four wickets -- sixty-five caught and nineteen stumped. In those games he also scored 802 runs with an average of 20, batting particularly well at  Manchester in 1896 for 65 not out and at Leeds three years later for 55. When he gave up county cricket in 1911 he settled in Bristol, and after the War was a member of the special advisory committee which helped to re-establish the Gloucestershire County Cricket Club. Playing for Warwickshire first in 1888 when the county had not been admitted to first rank, Lilley kept wicket continuously for 23 years. Even in those years, he was recognized as one of the best wicketkeepers in the country. In the course of his career he caught out 705 batsmen and stumped 200. For  Warwickshire v. Yorkshire at Edgbaston in 1889 he caught three men and stumped four, and for the county v. M. C. C. at Lord\'s in 1896 he caught eight. He was also a fine forcing batsmen, and could generally be relied on for runs. In first-class matches he scored 15,746 runs, including sixteen centuries, and averaged 26. In three seasons he made over 1,000 runs. For his county against Surrey at The Oval in 1898 he, despite a broken finger, batted eighty-five minutes for 57 runs. He first appeared in a Test against Australia at Lord\'s in 1896. In that year he played in three of those matches; in 1899 in four, and in 1902,  1905, and 1909 he represented England in all five Tests against Australia. He went out to Australia with touring teams in 1901-02 and 1903-04. As a wicketkeeper he was most consistent and so pronounced an artist that at the end of his career his hands and fingers showed scarcely a trace of the heavy strain to which they had been subjected in taking bowling of all descriptions. Other wicketkeepers may have appeared more brilliant but there was none more sure in making a catch. Lilley, outside his powers as wicketkeeper and batsman, was an exceptionally fine judge of cricket and so well did captains, even of international teams, recognise his special qualities in this direction that they often consulted him during a match. \n', 'In the course of his many games for England, Lilley was intimately associated with two dramatic finishes at Old Trafford. In the match of 1896 in which Ranjitsinhji played his great  innings of 154 not out and Tom Richardson bowled so wonderfully, Lilley when Australia, with three wickets to fall, wanted nine runs for victory, missed Kelly in curious fashion. He took the ball cleanly enough but as he did so, pulled his arm back and struck his thigh, the impact being so sharp that it shook the ball out of his hands. Six years later on the same ground, England, with two wickets to fall, were within eight runs of victory when off a splendid square-leg hit, Lilley was out to a marvellous catch by  Clem Hill.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1897'],35.0,52,8,903.0,84,20.52,,,0,4,,0,70.0,22.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,416.0,639,46,15597,171,26.30,,,16,77,,,714.0,197.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35.0,1,25,23,1.0,1/23,1/23,23.0,5.52,25.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,416.0,,2323,1485,41,6/46,,36.21,3.83,56.6,,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

July 20, 1900, New Park, Harrogate, Yorkshire ","January 1, 1967, Scotton Banks, Harrogate, Yorkshire (aged 66 years 165 days) ",,"['England,', ""Maharaja of Patiala's XI,"", 'Yorkshire']",,,,,Left-hand bat,Slow left-arm orthodox,,,,"[""\nThe death of an illustrious cricketer is always sad ; it is doubly sad when the one who goes has long stood as a symbol of the game's combined strength and merriment. Maurice Leyland, who died on January 1, aged 66, was exactly as old as this part-worn century and his first-class career embraced the inter-war years in addition to the vital season afterwards. The body of English cricket in those years was built on firm bone and muscle, but, more often than not, Leyland was its spinal column. Your Yorkshire cricketer usually has, and admits to having, certain major qualities: sturdiness, independence and a refusal to consider defeat. Leyland had all these virtues and more; where he differed from many was that his fighting was done not grimly, but with a quizzical smile; the harder the battle, the stouter the resolution and the\nbroader the smile. \n"", 'Although he bothered little about his figures, they are none the less impressive. In all, he scored 33,660 runs ; of these 26,191 were for Yorkshire and 2,764 for England. These three totals give a general average of 40-50 ; for his county 41.05 and in his 41 Tests 46.06. If his average is higher for England than for Yorkshire, this was only partly significant. Assuredly the hardest task called out the best in the man and of his 80 centuries, nine were in Tests, seven of them against Australia but, while most cricketers regard England as an extension of their own counties, to Yorkshiremen England is a not unimportant part of Yorkshire. For Leyland, I suspect, a hundred\nagainst Australia was as richly satisfying as one in a Roses match - almost.', 'Because so many of his grandest efforts have been made with his broad back against the wall, he has often been seen as his side\'s rescuer-in-chief, but his batting was by nature an attacking weapon. At Scarborough in 1932 he and Sutcliffe hit 102 off half a dozen overs and, under sun or cloud, his personal philosophy was evident: ""Watch out when you have to ; hit out whenever you can, and think on all the time what you\'re there for.""', 'Leyland anecdotes are innumerable, but different. Many cricket stories are apocryphal in the sense that they are traditional tales, buckled on to the most colourful character of the period, though, to be fair, legends do not become encrusted upon nonentities. But Leyland stories have a personal hallmark, never depending for their point on those words which are the life\'s blood of the BBC\'s television drama. His humour was good humour, with the turn of the jest, more likely than not, against himself. When Hutton in his first Yorkshire match was run out for a duck, Leyland said: ""Never mind, lad,\nyou\'ve started at bottom."" Four years later these two shared a partnership of 382 in what will always be known as Hutton\'s match. Hutton\'s 364 took 1321 minutes while Leyland\'s 187 lasted half that time. Reproved for his slowness, Leyland, who had been dropped in the previous Test, replied with a straight face: ""Well, you see, I was playing for my place."" When Hutton\'s massive innings ended at last, there was an equally massive rush to celebrate and Leyland, winning the race to the bar by a short head, demanded two bottles of champagne.""Why two bottles, Maurice ?"" ""One for thee, Len, and one for me.""', 'His modesty had a rueful smile. Reproved for getting out to a dolly catch off a near-wide, ""Well, now,"" he apologised, ""I don\'t get a lot o\' practice against that sort.""', 'This modesty was a part of his quiet confidence. ""Nervous ? Of course I\'m nervous. There you are, out in t\' middle an there\'s 30,000 people all knowing better what to do than you do."" Talking things over, after a bombing raid of bumpers, he reflected: ""Nobody likes \'em, but some of us don\'t let on.""', 'If he knew himself to have the measure of the great O\'Reilly, who was no paper tiger, he also retained the respect of one master for another. Describing an over of fearsome hostility, he said: ""First he bowled me an off-break, then he bowled me a leg-break; then his googly, then a bumper, then one that went with his arm . . . .""', '""But that\'s only five, Maurice. What about the last\none ?""', '""Oh, that,"" said Maurice deprecatingly. ""That was a\nstraight \'un and it bowled me.""', 'The vintage Leyland story concerns a Test in which Australia had amassed a mammoth score and Leyland went in, bent on what seemed his regular task, to retrieve England\'s bad start. He did his duty faultlessly but, farm the bowling as he might, wicket after wicket fell and a quarter of an hour before the close England, with seven wickets down, were still some 300 behind. Batsman No. 9 hit his first ball into the covers and started on a nimble single. Leyland waved his eager partner back. "" Wait your hurry, Mr. Robins. We shan\'t get \'em all tonight.""', 'He tended to laugh at the notion of himself as a left-hand slow bowler in the county that gave birth to Rhodes, Kilner and Verity. Nevertheless, he came of bowling stock. His father, afterwards a dedicated groundsman, had been a prolific wicket-taker in club and minor counties cricket. Maurice, in fact, took more than 400 wickets for Yorkshire and in his last season he helped to clinch his county\'s championship with 7for 36 against Warwickshire. He was credited with the invention of the ball called ""The Chinaman,"" which was a left-hander\'s unexpected serenity. However depressed we might be, life seemed richer when we saw that burly figure striding to the crease: blue eyed, broad shouldered, fore-arms borrowed from a blacksmith, and cap tilted, not as much as Roy Kilner\'s, but more rakishly than Admiral Beatty\'s. England was back on the right road.', ""In the rugged masculine world of Test cricket, nobody has to be liked, much less loved. Consider Plink, Plonk or, if you like, Plunk; we admire them for their splendid skills and not - bless my soul! - for their pretty ways. Men of principle can be harsh and stiff-necked; amiable companions can be anything but men of principle. But once in a generation comes a man whose unchallenged integrity and humorous friendliness are in perfect balance. Such a man was Maurice Leyland, whose epitaph  - and he would have made a rare joke of it - might link with that of Samson's lion: Out of the Strong came forth Sweetness . . . ."", ' Maurice Leyland did not appear regularly for Yorkshire until 1922. He played once in 1920 and occasionally in 1921 under my captaincy. It was evident he had a great future before him. Maurice was charming to everyone and must have been one of the most popular cricketers of his day. He had a great sense of humour and told many amusing stories in the Yorkshire dialect. It was always thought in Yorkshire that the ball called ""The Chinaman"" originated from Maurice. A left-arm bowler, he sometimes bowled an enormous off-break from round the wicket which, if not accurately pitched, was easy to see and to get away on the leg-side. In later days, laughing about this, he would say it was a type of ball that might be good enough to get the Chinese out if no one else. Hence this ball became Maurice\'s ""Chinaman.""\n', '\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1929'],41.0,65,5,2764.0,187,46.06,,,9,10,,7,13.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,686.0,932,101,33660,263,40.50,,,80,154,,,246.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41.0,27,1103,585,6.0,3/91,3/91,97.5,3.18,183.8,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,686.0,,28971,13659,466,8/63,,29.31,2.82,62.1,,11,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

After seven years leading the county on the field, for much of the time under trying circumstances, he stood down at the end of the 2012 season, and in the following season proceeded to accumulate over 1,000 runs in County Championship cricket and 500 in the one day game. His captaincy successor James Tredwell then awakened interest from England, leaving Key to take charge once more - 2015 was to be his ninth season at the helm. \n', ""Cherry-cheeked Key had been marked down for great things - not least by headline-writers spotting an easy pun a mile off - since he helped England to win the Under-19 World Cup in South Africa early in 1998. His trademark shot was a back-foot biff through the covers, while his off-drive on the front foot pleases the purists too. Never the sleekest, Key's waistline expanded along with his burgeoning batting reputation, and he was 16 stone and counting before Alec Stewart had a quiet word. He encapsulated his approach to fitness on a questionnaire on the Kent website: in answer to the question 'Most likely to?' he responded 'Never run the London marathon'."", ""Over 1000 runs for Kent in 2001 were followed by a winter under Rod Marsh at the Academy in Adelaide. Key came back even leaner and hungrier, and more runs propelled him past Ian Bell - previously touted as the Next Big Thing - into the England side after Marcus Trescothick's broken thumb and Graham Thorpe's broken marriage created a vacancy or two. A couple of gutsy innings followed in Australia, although he displayed a worrying propensity for getting out when seemingly set, especially just after a break in play. But in 2004, he burst back into the limelight, scoring 1000 first-class runs by the second day of June, and cracking a magnificent 221 against West Indies at Lord's, in his first Test appearance for over a year."", 'The jury, however, was still out after a hit-and-miss winter in South Africa in 2004-05, when his culpable shot-selection in defeat at Cape Town was offset by an important half-century in the series-clinching victory at Johannesburg. He was appointed Kent\'s captain for the 2006 season, a role he took on ""to enhance, not hamper"" his career, and as captain of the England A team that took on the Sri Lankan and Pakistani tourists, it was clear he remained in the selectors\' thoughts. This was confirmed when he was named in the Academy squad to be based in Perth during the winter\'s Ashes series, and in 2007 his one-day game, a self-confessed weakness, came to fruition as he led Kent to a memorable Twenty20 Cup triumph at Edgbaston. Come the 2008 season he was champing at the bit for a Test recall, as demonstrated by an unbeaten 178 for Kent against the New Zealand tourists, a performance that earned him the captaincy of the Lions in 2008.', ""When the selectors did call again it was for England's opening match of the 2009 World Twenty20, at Lord's. Few will remember that Key contributed an unbeaten 10 but many will recall that the hosts lost to Netherlands. It was to be his only appearance, and by the time he decided to give up the Kent captaincy, at the end of the 2012 season, his name had all but disappeared off the international radar.

One of the rare fast bowlers in the game's long history to spread terror in opposition ranks by the mere mention of his name, he was, in turn, a young tearaway breaking free in the 1920s from a life in the Nottinghamshire coalmines; an English ogre and villain who bowled bumpers (as the bouncer was then called) at the heads and bodies of Australian batsmen; a `disgraced' hero banished to obscurity; and eventually a post-war migrant welcomed to Sydney in 1950 with his wife and family, the warmth of acceptance by those once so hostile to this aggressor proving both touching and slightly incomprehensible to him. \n"", ""There was one further phase. As the year lived in Australia came to equal those spent in his native England, Larwood became something of a curiosity, still generously receiving pilgrims and journalists at his Kingsford home, even though his eyesight failed in later years. And when British Prime Minister John Major gave Larwood's cricket achievement belated recognition by awarding him the MBE in 1993, his picture made the newspapers again, together with characteristic quotes from the old fast bowler as he contemplated the changes that had overtaken cricket in the many years since he was headline news himself. Scoffing at the amount of protective gear worn by modern batsmen, Larwood described them as `trussed up like turkeys' and asserted that they `should stand up and be counted like men'."", "" Larwood, who died in hospital in Sydney on July 22, aged 90, was the key figure in the never-to-be-allowed-to-be-forgotten `Bodyline' Test series of 1932-33, when England's supercilious, icy and provocative captain Douglas Jardine instructed him to bowl what they both insisted on calling ` leg theory' at the Australian batsmen. With Bill Voce, his hefty Notts team-mate, bowling fast left-arm from the other end, `Lol' Larwood spearheaded England to a 4-1 series victory, taking 33 wickets at just under 20 apiece as batsmen ducked, weaved and skipped, the heavy concentration of vulture-like leg-side fielders ready for catches from hurried defensive jabs."", "" Larwood's classical action, copied by countless schoolboys - including Ray Lindwall in Sydney - culminated in a side-on delivery, the ball's velocity touching the highest ever recorded"", ' Don Bradman, the prime target was reduced to comparative mediocrity with an average of 56 - he had made 974 runs (at 139.14) in England in the previous Ashes series of 1930- with Larwood hurrying him into indiscretions and taking his wicket four times in eight Test innings (and twice in the only other match in which they were in opposition, the Australian XI match at Melbourne before the First Test).', 'In the Adelaide Test, Australian exasperation reached white heat as the captain, Bill Woodfull, was struck stunningly over the heart by a lifting ball from Larwood- whose captain cynically switched to the Bodyline field as soon as Woodfull was able to continue - and Bert Oldfield suffered a fracture when edging another Larwood delivery onto his temple. Mounted police mustered behind the pavilion as the masses of spectators hooted and jeered and threatened to storm the field.', "" Woodfull later made some terse remarks to the sheepish MCC manager P. F. Warner, and the Australian Cricket Board fired off a cable to Lord's, protesting at the English bowling tactics. The respective governments were drawn into the controversy, but financial considerations saw to it that the series was played out, and Larwood even heard himself cheered wildly by the Sydney crowd in the final Test as he walked off after scoring 98 as nightwatchman batsman. The worst of the personal vilification was behind him, and some humour even emerged from the battleground. Lines from a popular contemporary revue ran: `Oh, they'd be a lot calmer in Ned Kelly's armour/When Larwood the wrecker begins.'"", ""He finished with a painfully damaged foot, but Jardine would not let him leave the field until Bradman was dismissed, the fast bowler's continuing presence serving as a depressant to Australia. The two principal adversaries left the field together, neither speaking."", "" Larwood never played for England again. Welcomed home as a popular hero, he soon found that `diplomacy' was at work. At Lord's members of the MCC committee had begun to understand the cause of Australian indignation. That cricket had been damaged was becoming obvious to all but the blindly partisan. Moves to outlaw the leg-side field-setting, if not the short-pitched fast ball, were instituted. And a letter of apology was drawn up for signature by Harold Larwood, the arch-exponent of Bodyline. Since he had been bowling to orders and believed in his heart that there was nothing sinister in his method of attack, he refused to sign the letter. His Test career was over at 28."", ""The broken left foot prevented him from bowling in 1933, but when Woodfull's 1934 team landed in England, speculation was high. Would Larwood resume combat with the Australians? Overlooked for the First Test allegedly because of a bruised foot, he spared the selectors any dilemma by stating before the Lord's Test: `I refuse to play in any more Tests. Politicians are trying to hound me out of cricket. I was fit for the last Test. They feared I would burst the Empire.'"", 'He took 82 cheap wickets for Notts that summer, and over 100 in 1935 and 1936, topping the national bowling averages in 1936 for the fifth time in his life, a deed unmatched by any other fast bowler. England had clearly denied themselves a great talent.', 'Captain Jardine, architect of the Bodyline upheaval, paid no penalty, led England in India a year later, and declared himself unwilling to play against Australia again.', 'Harold was the fourth of five sons presented to miner Robert Larwood by his wife. He was born in Nuncargate, Notts on Nov 14, 1904 (precisely the same day as future Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey). Larwood left school at 13 and worked in a shop before becoming a pit-boy, working with the ponies. The teenaged fast bowler showed distinct promise in village and junior league matches, and at 19 he was signed by Nottinghamshire.', ""In 20 matches in 1925 he took 73 wickets and frightened a few batsmen, and the following year found him playing his First Test, against Australia at Lord's where he dismissed Charlie Macartney, Jack Gregory and Herby Collins. England's captain was Arthur Carr, who was also Larwood's county skipper, a tough, uncompromising man who had most to do with developing and encouraging this bright new talent."", ' Larwood was not chosen again until the final Test, when England regained the Ashes at the Oval from an ageing Australian combination. The home team recalled 48-year-old spinner Wilfred Rhodes, and with Hobbs and Sutcliffe making high-class centuries, victory was achieved by 289 runs. Young Larwood captured six wickets.', ""Around 5ft 8ins, but strongly-built with wide shoulders and long arms, he had a smooth, rhythmic approach and a high arm action. His speed was truly exceptional, and because of his lack of height, his bouncer tended to skid, veering into the ribs rather than wastefully over the head. The schoolboy Ray Lindwall drew upon this action after watching through the pickets at the SCG in 1932-33. In more recent times, the Pakistan express bowler Waqar Younis has had much of Larwood's movement about his run-up and delivery. Larwood's stock ball snapped in from the off, and in days when leg-before dismissals could be granted only from balls that pitched between wicket and wicket, he was denied many a dismissal that would have been given to succeeding generations of bowlers."", ""There is a macabre tendency to assess fast bowlers' potency by the injuries they inflict. Larwood always claimed that he never tried to hit a batsman - though legend has it that he and Voce bet each other a packet of fags over who would be first to strike an Indian batsman on the turban in 1932. (Beer and cigarettes, incidentally, were Larwood's staple intake during intervals.) Among batsmen who sustained serious injury from Larwood's thunderbolts were Reg Sinfield of Gloucestershire, the South African `Jock' Cameron, and Patsy Hendren, a seasoned exponent of the hook shot. All were stretchered off unconscious. Scores of others suffered breaks and bruises in the line of Larwood's fire, and many a batsman in county cricket discovered minor ailments that necessitated their withdrawal before matches against Nottinghamshire."", ""In 1927, Larwood embarked on a marriage which was to last into its seventh decade, and in 1928, after two Test appearances that summer against West Indies, he went to Australia with Percy Chapman's 1928-29 side and was part of a highly successful campaign in which Wally Hammond made 905 runs in the five Tests, and Larwood led off with 6 for 32 in Australia's opening innings, at Brisbane's Exhibition Ground, in a match won by England by a massive margin, 675 runs. It was Don Bradman's maiden Test, bringing onto the stage the two central characters of the drama four years ahead."", "" Larwood impressed as a lower-order batsman and as a fieldsman on this first Australian tour of his, and he gained his 18 Test wickets with fast, straight bowling and admirable stamina. Injuries continued to interrupt his progress, but he always fought his way back to fitness, even though illness cost him an appearance in the 1930 Lord's Test against Australia. This was Bradman's season. He gathered, swiftly, 974 runs in his seven Test innings, and Larwood, who took only four wickets in his three Tests that summer, got the 21-year-old champion out only once, for 232 at the Oval- and that was a dubious decision."", "" England were left in no doubt as to the problem facing them when next they toured Australia. With a triple-century, two double-centuries and an `ordinary' century under his belt in the 1930 Tests, what might the `Boy from Bowral' do on his hard pitches at home?"", ""Thus Bodyline was conceived. England wicketkeeper George Duckworth observed an uncertainty in Bradman's batting at the Oval when rain freshened the pitch and the ball flew. Notts captain Arthur Carr had significant input into the planning of the leg-side attack, and actually had Larwood and Voce staging rehearsals against hapless county opposition. `Cricket's Hiroshima' thus came to pass."", 'With the acrimonious 1932-33 Test series proving to be his last, Larwood finished with a Test record of 78 wickets, average 28.36, in his 21 appearances, and for a further four years he inflicted misery on the lives of English county batsmen until his body finally gave in to the punishment of the years. He took in all 1427 first-class wickets at only 17.52, and there were three centuries among his 438 innings (average 19.92).', 'He had put his name to a book, ', '?, which was both a narrative of the Test tour and a wholehearted attempt at justification of the English tactics, and some uncompromising articles appeared under his name in newspapers upon his return home in 1933. But after retirement from cricket, Harold Larwood entered willingly into a secluded obscurity, playing league cricket briefly for Blackpool, then becoming a grower of flowers and vegetables. After the Second World War he bought a confectionery shop in Blackpool, and in 1950, now with five daughters, he and wife Lois decided to join the mass exodus of the disillusioned from war-fatigued Britain. They sailed to Sydney on none other than ', "", the vessel which had taken Jardine's MCC side to Australia in 1932."", ""Initially they stayed in a hotel, with half the bill, as Larwood later discovered, being paid by former Prime Minister Ben Chifley, one of the fast bowler's numerous unexpected admirers. Jack Fingleton later described with amusement how the broad Australian and Nottingham accents rendered conversation between these two humble men mutually unintelligible."", ' Larwood found employment in a soft-drinks factory, and soon warmed to the egalitarianism of Australian life. He was deeply affected also by the readiness with which he was accepted by old cricket opponents as well as total strangers. Though he never lost his native accent and always spoke nostalgically of England, he knew and repeatedly acknowledged that Australia was the place for him.', 'Just before leaving England, he had passed the time of day with Don Bradman at the 1948 tour farewell dinner, and a year later there was further balm in the form of honorary membership of MCC. Years later he was even elected to life membership of the SCG, scene of some of his most stirring deeds.', ""He told his story in detail, in a book prepared by Kevin Perkins, in 1965. He joined studio discussions during nocturnal broadcasts of Ashes Test matches from England. Occasionally he lent his name to newspaper pieces. On the 50th anniversary of the Bodyline Tests he expressed the opinion that Ian Botham was `over-rated': `The way he's been bowling out here, he wouldn't burst a paper bag.' A few months ago he enjoyed a visit from Darren Gough, and telephoned later to congratulate him on his 6 for 49 in the Sydney Test."", "" Harold Larwood, the former 100 miles-per-hour bowler, would dip into his trunkful of memorabilia to oblige visiting admirers. Always he made sure they laid eyes on his presentation ashtray from Douglas Jardine, which symbolised the greatest of his many achievements on the cricket field. It is inscribed `To Harold for the Ashes - 1932-33 From a grateful Skipper'."", '\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1927'],21.0,28,3,485.0,98,19.4,,,0,2,,2,15.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,361.0,438,72,7290,102*,19.91,,,3,23,,,234.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21.0,36,4969,2212,78.0,6/32,10/124,28.35,2.67,63.7,3,4,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,361.0,,58027,24994,1427,9/41,,17.51,2.58,40.6,,98,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

From the time he deposited the second ball, from Chris Morris, over mid-wicket for six, he never looked back. \n"", ""By the end of the summer, Malan had won a place in England's Ashes tour party, with England hoping he could play a tough-guy role at No 4. His first five Tests, against South Africa and the West Indies, were far from exceptional, with an average of 23.82 and only two half-centuries, but England calculated he possessed the fortitude and, at 30, the know-how to handle an Australian series. He did exactly that by scoring England's first hundred of the Ashes series after they had reached the WACA 2-0 down, a tough, grown-up innings that was exactly what was needed at a time when England were having to answer charges of off-field immaturity. "", 'Ed Smith, though, was a restless new national selector and after three Tests of the 2018 summer Malan carried the can for top-order failings. Much emphasis was placed on the fact that his average in England was a paltry 20.23 in eight Tests, with a top score of 65 against West Indies. Middlesex did not bring release: a failed promotion campaign under his leadership, more T20 failure and a Championship average the wrong side of 30.', 'Malan had shown in domestic cricket that he was capable of dominant innings. Nine years earlier, as an unknown 20-year-old for Middlesex in 2008, he came in at No 6 to hit a brilliant unbeaten hundred in a Twenty20 quarter-final against a Lancashire attack containing Andrew Flintoff, Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork. He was still being called an unknown - in Australia at least - as his twenties drew to a close.', ""Malan had put himself on the verge of an England call-up with a record-breaking performance for England Lions against Sri Lanka A in Northampton in 2016. Malan, the Lions' captain and elder statesman, struck an unbeaten 185 from 126 balls - a record for the Lions or England A in List A cricket, beating 168 by Ravi Bopara against West Indies A in Worcester in 2010."", 'Such exploits looked bound to bring him an England T20 debut when he was named in the squad to face Sri Lanka at the Ageas Bowl, only for him to lose out to the local boy James Vince.  But he put all that behind him with an excellent all-round season for Middlesex, striking three hundreds in their title-winning campaign and scoring heavily in T20 before heading for the Bangladesh Premier League.', 'Malan is a bludgeoning left-handed batsman possessed of power and panache, with some part-time leg spin thrown in. His progress has been undermined by inconsistency and a penchant for soft dismissals.', 'Born in Roehampton but brought up in South Africa, he made his first-class debut for Boland in 2005-06. In 2006 he played 2nd XI cricket for both Middlesex and Worcestershire, making his first-team debut for Middlesex in front of 20,000 people in a T20 Cup match at The Oval. He struggled to find a first-team spot the following season but in 2008 took his chance in style.', ""An impressive run in the Twenty20 earned him a place in the Championship side, where he scored his maiden century against Northamptonshire. But it was that Lancashire T20 innings that stood out as he made 103 off 51 balls, an innings that helped cement his place in the England Performance Squad in November 2008. It was described by his then captain Ed Joyce as 'the best innings I've ever witnessed from a 20-year-old'."", 'He was widely touted as a future England player, but instead his form slumped. In 2013, a Championship average of just 21.50 - across 12 Division One matches and with a top score of 61 - was a desperately poor return for a player of obvious ability. But after almost two years without a Championship hundred, including three dismissals in the 90s, he ended his wait with a century against Northamptonshire in June 2014 - and promptly added another against Somerset a week later. He averaged 45.48 in first-class cricket in 2014 - the first season he had averaged over 40. But Malan was more consistent in white ball cricket, leading to opportunities to play for Prime Doleshwar Sporting Club in Bangladesh.

February 9, 1922, Frizinghall, Bradford, Yorkshire ","April 23, 1986, Putney, London (aged 64 years 73 days) ",,"['England,', 'Auckland,', 'Essex,', 'Surrey']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm offbreak,,,,"['\n', ""Jim Laker will always be remembered for his bowling in the Test match at Old Trafford in 1956, when he took 19 Australian wickets for 90, 9 for 37 in the first innings and 10 for 53 in the second. No other bowler has taken more than seventeen wickets in a first-class match, let alone in a Test match. The feat is unique and, rash though it may seem to say, may well remain so. Ten wickets in an innings, more than any other achievement in cricket, must contain a large element of luck: however well a man bowls, the odds must always be that his partner will pick up a wicket. In this case these odds were heavier than usual because Lock at the other end was, on such a wicket, as great a spinner as Laker and bowled superbly. What turned the scale was that Laker was bowling off-breaks whereas Lock relied on the left-armer's natural leg-break, and the Australians at that period were wholly inexperienced in playing off-breaks, especially on a wicket which, heavily marled and almost devoid of grass, might have been designed for an off-spinner. \n"", ""Since the days of Howell and Trumble at the turn of the century, Australian wickets had become so unresponsive to finger-spin that the off-break had virtually disappeared and sides relied on pace and wrist-spin - Gregory and McDonald, Lindwall, Miller and Johnston or again Hordern, Mailey, Grimmett and O'Reilly. Against these two types of bowler the essential is to get into line, so that the bat can swing straight down the path of the ball. But the batsman who follows this principle against vicious off-spin soon finds himself reduced to an ugly jab right across the line, and the result is always likely to be an lbw or a catch to one of the close-fielders. Moreover, so accurate was Laker that these fielders could stand very close indeed. In any case this was the weakest Australian batting side for more than 60 years, with the possible exception of 1912 when four of their essential batsmen refused to come. In particular, they lacked a great attacking genius like Trumper, MacArtney or Bradman who would refuse to be dictated to and who might have disrupted the entire plan. Indeed, the Australians had had a foretaste earlier in the season of what might happen when, for Surrey at The Oval, Laker had taken 10 for 88 in the first innings, the only instance of a bowler performing the feat twice in one season. Altogether that summer he played seven times against the Australians and took 63 wickets for 10 runs each."", 'Born at Frizinghall, near Bradford, Laker was brought up in Yorkshire and in his schooldays was a batsman and a fast bowler. It was B. B. Wilson who, in indoor nets early in the war, suggested that he should change to off-spin and, while serving in the Middle East and having the chance of playing Army cricket with a number of distinguished players, he turned the advice to good account. Before being demobilised he was billeted at Catford and joined the cricket club, whose president then was Andrew Kempton, who for years did so much for young Surrey cricketers. Kempton recommended him to The Oval and, after playing twice for Surrey in 1946 against the Combined Services, he was taken on the county staff, the Surrey authorities having first made sure that Yorkshire were not interested. He soon made his place secure in the Surrey side in 1947 and headed their bowling averages. At the end of the season he was picked for the largely experimental MCC side which Gubby Allen was taking to the West Indies and was one of the few successes among the untried players. In the first innings of the first Test he took 7 for 103 (six of them on the second morning for 25) and, though handicapped later by strained stomach muscles, he came out top of the averages.', ""However, in England in 1948 he suffered a severe setback. The Australian side that year was, at a modest computation, one of the strongest batting sides in the history of cricket, and nothing in Laker's limited experience had prepared him for such an ordeal. On his second appearance against them for MCC at Lord's, he was hit for nine 6s on the second morning. None the less he was chosen for the first Test and created a sensation by being easily the top scorer in the first innings with 63 made in 90 minutes: the total was 165 and he and Bedser added 89 for the ninth wicket. He also took three early wickets, Morris, Barnes and Miller, but after that he was ineffective, as he was too in the second Test. Dropped for the third Test, he was recalled for the fourth, in which Australia, set to get 404 in 344 minutes, got them within a quarter of an hour of time. The pitch was taking spin, the ball was lifting - a few years later, Laker would have been in his element. Unfortunately he failed to keep a length: moreover, although there was a spot just where a slow left-armer or leg-spinner could have used it, it was no help to him. Altogether that season his fourteen wickets against the Australians cost him 59.35 runs each, and it was probably this, and especially the treatment he received at Lord's, which led the selectors to feel that, however successful he might be in county cricket, he was not really a Test match bowler."", 'Yet in the coming years, in the immensely strong Surrey sides which won the Championship season after season, he and Lock proved themselves one of the greatest combinations on a turning wicket in cricket history, comparable with Peel and Briggs for England, Blythe and Woolley for Kent or Parker and Goddard for Gloucestershire. Laker may well have thought that, when he took eight for 2 for England against the Rest at Bradford in 1950, his place in the England side was secure, but in the next six years he was often left out in England and went on only one tour abroad, to the West Indies, where it has to be admitted that he was terribly expensive. However, he did have his successes in England. It was, for instance, undoubtedly he who won the final Test against South Africa in 1951 with 4 for 64 and 6 for 55, and after taking more than 100 wickets for Surrey alone that season he was included among the Five Cricketers of the Year in the 1952', '.', 'After 1956 the attitude of the selectors naturally changed. In 1957 Laker played in four Tests against West Indies, missing one through illness, and again in 1958 in four of the five against New Zealand. In 1956-57 he was one of the MCC side in South Africa, where he met with fair success, and at last in 1958-59 was picked for a tour of Australia, where he topped the bowling averages both in the Tests and in all first-class matches. But he was by now feeling the strain and opted out of the New Zealand part of the tour which followed. In England in 1959 he was not the bowler he had been: his 78 wickets cost 24.61 runs each and he was much handicapped by an arthritic finger. At the end of the season he retired from the Surrey side, having taken for them, over thirteen years, 1,395 wickets at 17.37 in 309 matches: eleven times he had more than 100 wickets in a season. However, in 1962 he was persuaded by his friend, Trevor Bailey, to turn out for Essex, and for three years he appeared for them in 30 matches as an amateur. He was still capable of discomfiting the best players.', 'In 1960 he had published a book, ', "", which gave so much offence to the authorities at Lord's and The Oval that they withdrew his honorary membership of MCC and Surrey, although these were restored some years later, and at the time of his death he was Chairman of Surrey's cricket committee. Meanwhile he had found himself a new career as a television cricket commentator: he had, of course, a deep knowledge of his subject, he was admirably clear and, though outspoken, never unfair."", 'In all first-class matches he took 1,944 wickets at 18.41 and scored 7,304 runs with an average of 16.60, including two centuries, both for Surrey. In 46 Test matches, he took 193 wickets at 21.24. He was also a good close-fielder.

An immaculate batsman possessing the grand manner, he would have gained still higher renown on the playing field but for periods of poor health and the calls of business. Expert knowledge, obtained by careful study of every intricacy of the game, besides experience in leading his school, his county, the Gentlemen and England, might have made him supreme as captain, but he lacked the buoyant optimistic temperament so necessary for complete success in cricket and was easily upset by disagreement with selectors in being given players whom he did not consider suitable to the occasion. \n', 'To satisfy his own exacting ideas of perfect play and leadership, as described in his book ', ', he required the position of dictator in order to pick his own eleven and control them with expectation of ready response to his every word or gesture. Unfortunately for MacLaren, such idealistic conditions were never forthcoming on the big occasion, but the responsibility for this rested partly with him more than once, when he was one of the selectors. Facts bear this out, as will be seen; but in batting he accomplished much, and will remain a magnificent figure in the eyes of all who saw him making runs.', ""He will always be remembered for his 424 for Lancashire against Somerset at Taunton in 1895, a first-class score that stood unbeaten for nearly thirty years and has been exceeded only by Don Bradman, who now holds the record with 452 not out, and W. H. Ponsford in Australia. For choice as a Test Captain he remains unrivalled, having in the course of eleven years led England in 22 matches, and his 35 appearances against  Australia have been surpassed only by Hobbs and Rhodes during far longer periods. Often unfortunate when commander in these big events, he never led England to victory in a rubber, but showed his exceptional knowledge of the game when, having asserted that he could pick a side capable of beating the all-conquering Australian team of 1921, he fulfilled his prophecy by selecting and captaining eleven amateurs, who, at Eastbourne at the end of August, gained a victory by 28 runs after being 130 behind on the first innings. In that climax to his career in England he retained his superb figure, though white hair suggested more age than the approach of his fiftieth birthday. He finished his intimate association with first-class cricket by acting as manager to S. B. Joel's team that toured  South Africa in 1924-25."", ""Son of Mr. James MacLaren, for many years Hon. Treasurer of Lancashire C.C., Archie MacLaren was born on December 1, 1871, at Manchester, and began his important cricket life auspiciously when only fifteen years of age by scoring 55 and 67 for Harrow against Eton in 1887. He finished four years in the eleven as captain, and with 76 in a total of 133 off the Eton bowlers at Lord's, showed such form that a month later he appeared in county cricket, and in his first match for  Lancashire played a fine innings of 108 against Sussex at Hove."", 'His obvious powers took some time to ripen, but within a few years he reached the front rank of batsmen. Possessed of great resource, he could, according to circumstances, play a cautious or a brilliant game that made him splendid to watch from the ringside. Standing erect with bat raised well behind him, he was ready to receive any kind of delivery and would force the ball away with every sort of powerful stroke.', 'Captain of  Lancashire from 1894 to 1896, and again from 1899 to 1907, he reasserted himself in 1921 as described, and in the winter of 1922-23, at the age of 51, when leading an  M.C.C. side in New Zealand, he scored 200 not out at  Wellington in a representative match. Besides his record 424, he three times exceeded two hundred for his county, 226 at Canterbury against Kent in 1896, next year 244 in the same fixture, and 204 at Liverpool against Gloucester in 1903. From 1893 to 1909 he frequently appeared for  Gentlemen against Players, making 728 runs in these games with an average of 45; in 1903, when he and C. B. Fry added 309 in three hours for the third wicket without being separated, he scored 168.', 'Eight times in England and once in Australia he obtained over 1,000 runs in a season, his largest aggregate being 1,886 (average 42) in the summer of 1903. He enjoyed pronounced success on the  Sydney ground, where in the winter of 1897-98 against New South Wales he scored 142 and 100 in one match, 109 and 50 not out a month later against Australia, 61 and 140 in another match with New South Wales, and 65 in the last Test. He also got 124 against Australia at Adelaide and 181 at Brisbane, altogether six centuries on that tour, in which he made 1,037 runs, average 54.57, in first-class matches. No wonder that MacLaren is still talked of in  Australia, and especially at Sydney, for his wonderful batting as an object lesson for everyone.', ""In Test matches between England and Australia he made 1,931 runs, four times reaching three figures and averaging nearly 34. Twice in the nineties he toured Australia with teams led by A. E. Stoddart, and in the winter of 1901-02 he himself took out a side; but in Test matches this team, like the second captained by Stoddart, suffered four defeats and gained only one victory. In three home seasons -- 1899,  1902 and 1909 -- England, captained by him, won only two of fourteen engagements and lost each rubber. MacLaren visited America with K. S. Ranjitsinhji's team in 1899, and the Argentine in 1911-12 with the M.C.C. side led by Lord Hawke, and he also played in India."", ""He astonished everyone by taking S. F. Barnes, of small experience in first-class cricket, on the 1901-02 tour in Australia. Yet he could not keep that wonderful bowler in the Lancashire county eleven, and in 1909 he failed to persuade his county colleague, Walter Brearley, then the best of our fast bowlers, to accept a last-moment invitation to play for  England at Lord's."", 'Opinions differ as to the ability of MacLaren as a captain. Everyone agrees that he held strong views and was loath to depart from them even if his leadership actually suffered. In fact, it appeared more than once that he pursued ways that showed up some curious decision of selection committees in carrying out their duties.', 'Undoubtedly he found occasional brilliant inspirations, born of his exceptional knowledge of cricket, but he committed some blunders difficult to understand in a man of his experience. A notable illustration of his erratic disposition occurred at The Oval in the Test match of 1909. To begin with, having the final word in the composition of the eleven, he decided, despite fine weather and a hard wicket, that England should take the field without a good fast bowler, John Sharp, of Lancashire, being preferred to Buckenham, of Essex. Then, with the score 9 and one man out, he took Sidney Barnes off in favour of Sharp, mainly a batsman, and kept D. W. Carr, a googly bowler, aged 37, on at one end for an hour and a half, an action for which it would have been difficult to excuse anybody. That was the match in which Warren Bardsley made 136 and 130.', ""Another lapse from wisdom was at  Old Trafford in 1902, when he sent to deep square leg Fred Tate, always a short slip; and that historic dropped catch brought about England's defeat in a match upon which the rubber depended -- only victory in that engagement could have prevented the honours going to Australia. Yet such was his knowledge of the game that at Leeds in 1904 he gave  Yorkshire first innings, and Lancashire, by avoiding defeat in George Hirst's benefit match, went through the season unbeaten and were champions for the only time under  MacLaren's captaincy."", ""An incident in which MacLaren took strong action was of a kind without precedent or repetition, so far as known, and it aroused severe criticism. In July 1907 at Lord's on the second day the paying public were admitted although saturated turf showed no sign of drying and any cricket was extremely unlikely. Yet the stumps were set, and when pulled up at quarter to five some of the crowd, after demonstrating in front of the pavilion, walked across the pitch. After prolonged discussion between the captains -- Gregor MacGregor led  Middlesex -- and umpires, this statement was handed to the Press by A. C. MacLaren himself. Owing to the pitch having been deliberately torn up by the public, I, as captain of the Lancashire Eleven, cannot see any way to continue the game, the groundsman bearing me out that the wicket could not be again put right. -- A. C. MacLaren. As described in the 1908 "", ', the match was accordingly abandoned. Rolled next morning for the regulation ten minutes, the pitch showed little trace of the damage.', ""Naturally such a cricketer received many tributes to his ability. In January 1896 the Lancashire club elected him a life member and presented him with a gold watch and chain in recognition of his record score and of three successive hundreds hit in the course of eight days at the end of August that same season -- 152 at Old Trafford against Nottinghamshire, 108 at Lord's against  Middlesex, and 135 at Leicester. Ten years later  Lancashire made him a special presentation. In September 1921 he accepted an appointment to coach young players of the county, but an injured knee compelled his resignation early in the 1923 season.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1895'],35.0,61,4,1931.0,140,33.87,,,5,8,,0,29.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,424.0,703,52,22236,424,34.15,,,47,95,,,452.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,424.0,,321,267,1,1/44,,267.00,4.99,321.0,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

An Essex player from 1924 to 1939, he scored 17,789 runs, average 26.39, as a left-handed batsman strong in strokes in front of the wicket and with right-arm fast bowling took 1,834 wickets for 21.66 runs apiece. Of his 20 centuries the highest was 205 against Hampshire at Southend in 1936. He was first recommended to Essex solely as a batsman, but Percy Perrin, observing his height and strong physique, encouraged him as a pace bowler. How successful this proved is shown by the fact that in each of eleven seasons Stan Nichols dismissed over 100 batsmen, his best being that of 1938 when he took 171 wickets at a cost of 19.92 runs each. He could bowl for long spells without fatigue or loss of accuracy. \n', 'He enjoyed perhaps his greatest triumph as an all-rounder in 1935 when at Huddersfield he played the leading part in the overthrow by an innings and 204 runs of Yorkshire, the ultimate Champions, whose one defeat in the competition this was. In the two innings he gained an analysis of 11 wickets for 54 runs and he hit 146.

A final Test average of 38 adds up to just an adequate Test cricketer. But he was more than adequate, much more. For a decade he held England together. Nobody in the world has scored more Test runs since the start of the 1990s.

His talents have been particularly apparent in Test cricket where his command of swing bowling, especially on his home grounds, has been the stuff of artistry, bearing comparison with any swing bowler in any age. He has been an integral part of three victorious Ashes campaigns and became the first England bowler to take 500 Test wickets, leaving Ian Botham's previous benchmark of 383 a mere dot on the horizon. His one-day career has also had its moments as he gradually became adept at bowling in a more defensive fashion, but it is as an attacking swing bowler where he has had few peers. \n"", 'Anderson\'s 500th Test wicket came in September 2017 when he dismissed Kraigg Brathwaite in a Lord\'s Test against the West Indies. It was a delivery that illustrated his talent, coming down the slope to hit middle stump (his 501st - to bowl Kieran Powell - was even better). He became only the sixth player, and third pace bowler seamer after McGrath and Courtney Walsh, to reach the landmark and admitted to feeling emotional. ""Normally it\'s anger but today it was a bit more, not quite teary but emotional. I don\'t get like that when trying to focus on my job and it took me a bit by surprise.""', 'Anderson has been something of a contradiction. He has had a reputation for being shy and uncommunicative off the field, except in the company of close friends, yet on the field his verbal aggression, which he has argued is necessary to conquer that diffident character, not always endeared him to opponents or critics.', ""For the first six years of Anderson's international career, the best way to sum up his bowling was to paraphrase Mother Goose: when he's good, he's very, very good - and when he's bad, he's horrid. But when the force was with him, he was capable of irresistible spells, seemingly able to swing the ball round corners at an impressive speed."", ""Anderson had played only three one-day games for Lancashire when he was hurried into England's one-day squad in Australia in 2002-03 as cover for Andy Caddick. He didn't have a number - or even a name - on his shirt, but a remarkable ten-over stint, costing just 12 runs, in century heat at Adelaide earned him a World Cup spot. There, he produced a matchwinning spell against Pakistan before a sobering last-over disaster against Australia."", ""Five wickets followed in the first innings of his debut Test, against Zimbabwe at home in 2003, then a one-day hat-trick against Pakistan, but his fortunes waned. For a couple of years Anderson was a peripheral net bowler as attempts to change his action to avoid injury affected his pace and rhythm. That oft-predicted stress fracture kept him out for most of 2006, but he still made the Australian tour and the World Cup. However, as England's 2005 Ashes-winning attack began to fall apart, Anderson made his second coming - starting in Wellington on the 2007-08 tour of New Zealand, where he and Stuart Broad were united for the first time. The same opponents were blown away at Trent Bridge (Anderson 7 for 43) a few weeks later, during a summer that earned Anderson the honour of being named among Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year. He marked the award, given at the start of the 2009 season, by making the West Indians looked clueless at Chester-le-Street (nine wickets in the match)."", 'In 2010 Anderson came of age in a staggeringly comprehensive fashion. No longer content with being unplayable when the mood caught him, he took the decision to shelve the ""magic balls"" and concentrated on hammering out a rock-solid line and length, with dot balls and maidens his new holy grail. The upshot was a scintillating year in which he proved unhittable in every sense, with an economy rate that ramped up the pressure in every spell, and a range of weapons that made him a threat on every surface. ', 'A career-best 11-wicket haul against Pakistan at Trent Bridge, when he came as close to unplayable as at any time in his career, was the prelude to a breakthrough tour of Australia in the winter of 2010-11. Anderson arrived to a torrent of doubters, who recalled his forlorn performance on the preceding Ashes four years earlier, in which he had taken five wickets at 82.60. But he left with a series-sealing 24 scalps at 26.04, and a reputation transformed. ', 'Deadly with conventional swing and seam, and with a new line in reverse swing as well, he had become arguably the most complete fast bowler in the world. He was awarded the Freedom of Burnley - his home town - in 2012, which was also his benefit year, and also eased past Brian Statham\'s 252 Test wickets to become Lancashire\'s most successful England bowler. His increased range was demonstrated in India the following winter, when Anderson claimed 12 wickets at 30.25 but was described by MS Dhoni as ""the major difference between the two sides"".', ""In 2013, fittingly at Lord's, a ground where enjoyed much success, he became the fourth England bowler to reach 300 Test wickets when he had Peter Fulton caught at slip. When he began the Ashes with a match-winning 10-wicket haul at Trent Bridge his form showed no signs of abating, but the following nine Tests against Australia were far less successful as a chastened England returned home after the battering down under in 2013-14."", ""Anderson took 37 wickets in seven Tests against Sri Lanka and India in 2014, but his reputation was sullied by a verbal confrontation in the first Test at Trent Bridge with India's Ravindra Jadeja and accusations of pushing and shoving on the way in the dressing room corridor. India insisted that his behaviour had become unacceptable, but the resulting ICC investigation could not separate the truth from the lies and both men got off lightly. The World Cup in the antipodes was another unhappy episode, as the curtain came down on Anderson's 194-game ODI career - another format in which he was England's leading wicket-taking exponent - after an ignominious group-stage exit."", ""By then, England's Test bowling records were bound to fall his way. He passed Botham's record Test-wicket haul in the Caribbean and shortly afterwards reached 400 against New Zealand at Headingley. His fitness remained exemplary, his action as rhythmical as ever, and his appetite still powerful enough to imagine, as he passed his 33rd birthday, playing for another five years. A northern spring, Sri Lanka the opposition, cheered him with three five-wicket hails in successive Tests in Leeds and Chester-le-Street in 2016, but a shoulder injury marred his summer and he was innocuous on Indian pitches as England slumped to a 4-0 defeat that winter. "", ""The 500-mark beckoned, however, and a fit-again Anderson averaged 14.10 during the home series against South Africa and West Indies. He was the pick of the attack as England were crushed in Australia yet again, and continued to rule the roost at home. When he bowled Mohammed Shami to complete England's 4-1 win over India and record his 564th Test wicket, McGrath's pace-bowling record was eclipsed - and there were tears on the outfield from Anderson, as he contemplated the retirement of his great mate Alastair Cook."", ""That Anderson's left-hand batting has also steadily improved from his early days as a fully paid-up rabbit was illustrated when he struck 81 against India in 2014 - his maiden first-class fifty - as he shared a Test record stand of 198 for the tenth wicket with Joe Root in the first innings. He has served England with distinction as a nightwatchman on numerous occasions and went 54 Test innings before collecting a duck, an England record. At Cardiff in 2009 he survived for 69 nail-chewing minutes to help stave off defeat by Australia. He has also been an outstanding fielder, strikingly so for a fast bowler, lithe in the outfield and sharp in the catching positions."", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2002', 'Awarded the OBE in June 2015']",148.0,207.0,86.0,1174.0,81,9.7,2940.0,39.93,0.0,1.0,159.0,3.0,91.0,0.0,194.0,79,43,273.0,28,7.58,561,48.66,0,0,23,0,53.0,0.0,19.0,4,3,1.0,1*,1.00,2,50.0,0,0,0,0,3.0,0.0,239.0,308,124,1790,81,9.72,,,0,1,,,140.0,0.0,255.0,102,62,371,28,9.27,,,0,0,,,65.0,0.0,44.0,10,6,23,16,5.75,26,88.46,0,0,3,0,8.0,0.0,148.0,277,32335,15490,575.0,7/42,11/71,26.93,2.87,56.2,27,27,3,194.0,191,9584,7861,269.0,5/23,5/23,29.22,4.92,35.6,11,2,0,19.0,19,422,552,18.0,3/23,3/23,30.66,7.84,23.4,0,0,0,239.0,,48503,23446,920,7/42,,25.48,2.90,52.7,40,45,6,255.0,,12414,10003,352,5/23,5/23,28.41,4.83,35.2,11,2,0,44.0,44,933,1318,41,3/23,3/23,32.14,8.47,22.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

His power, timing and placement through extra cover and midwicket, his two great scoring areas, could sometimes make him uncontrollable. To the regret of his many admirers, however, Amiss's dismal record against Australia denied him acceptance as a top-ranking England batsman.

For Kent, he was an integral part of their Championship side from 1927 to the first match of 1951, when a sharp recurrence of back trouble, which had dogged him for so long, brought his career to an end while he was actually at the crease. By this time he had amassed 37,248 runs, average 43.51, made 102 hundreds, including nine double-hundreds, and passed 1,000 runs in a season seventeen times, going on to 3,000 once and 2,000 on five occasions. He had had a direct interest in 1,121 dismissals, of which more than 1,000 were effected when he was keeping wicket. His total of 418 stumpings is easily a record. \n"", ""Born at Elham near Canterbury on December 3, 1905, Ames went to Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone and at seventeen was brought to the notice of the Kent authorities. It was the county coach at the time, G. V. J. Weigall, who persuaded him to take up wicketkeeping as a second string to his bow, and a year or two passed before the young man began to appreciate the soundness of this advice. However, in  1927, Ames's first full season, his aggressive approach to batting and form behind the stumps repeatedly caught the eye. And all the time his famous partnership with Tich Freeman was being cemented. In 1928, these two astounded the world of cricket: Freeman took a record 304 wickets and Ames, making 122 dismissals and 1,919 runs, achieved the wicketkeeper's double for the first time. A year later he repeated what had been a unique achievement, but with a record 128 dismissals, and in  1932, when he was in superlative all-round form, he scored 2,482 runs, including nine centuries, at 57.72 to finish third in the national averages and made a record 64 stumpings in a total of 104 dismissals. In 1933, a batsman's year, he enjoyed an "", "". Far from feeling stale after a gruelling tour of Australia, he discovered an even greater appetite for runs, scoring 3,058 including three double-hundreds and six other three-figure innings. He also made the highest score of his career, 295 against Gloucestershire at Folkestone, and two separate hundreds in a match for the first time, against Northamptonshire at Dover. To cap it all, there were another 68 dismissals. Ames's innings of 295 was an excellent example of the tempo he regularly maintained once he was going; it took a little over 240 minutes and contained a six and 34 fours. It is probably true to say that he scored at around 50 runs per hour throughout his career, and it is hardly surprising that a player of his calibre should have won the Lawrence Trophy twice, in 1936 and 1939, both centuries being made in under 70 minutes. When Kent made 803 for four declared against Essex at Brentwood in 1934, Ames contributed an unbeaten 202, ensuring that the declaration could be made at lunch on the second day. In the season of 1937 he was as busy as ever, passing 2,000 runs for the third time and effecting 74 dismissals, though no longer with the help of Freeman, who had retired."", ""Ames represented England in 47 Tests, making 2,434 runs, including eight hundreds, an 97 dismissals (74 catches and 23 stumpings). He toured  Australia with M.C.C. in 1928-29 as reserve wicketkeeper to Duckworth, and would have played in the final Test at  Melbourne, purely as a batsman, but for breaking a finger keeping to Larwood. Instead, he made his début against  South Africa at The Oval in 1929 and toured the Caribbean under F.S.G. Calthorpe in the following winter. In the second of the representative matches (since granted full Test status) he helped Hendren in a match-winning stand of 237 for the fourth wicket in England's second innings, his 105 being the first century by an England wicketkeeper. In the fourth and final match, at Kingston, he hit his highest Test score of 149. Against New Zealand in 1931, Ames (137) and G. O. B. Allen (122) put on 246 together for the eighth wicket at Lord's, which has remained a record in Test matches for that wicket. The runs, which rescued England from a paltry 190 for seven, were made in under three hours, while at Christchurch in 1932-33 he and Hammond flogged the bowling all over the ground to the tune of 242 in 144 minutes for the fourth wicket. More restraint was expected of him at Lord's in 1934 against Australia on the first afternoon, when he and Leyland came together and added 129 in what was to prove a crucial partnership. Failure then, and England instead of Australia would have been caught on the sticky wicket so brilliantly exploited by Verity. Ames used to say that he was more proud of this innings of 120 than of all his others; "", "" simply described it as inspiring. In 1935, against South Africa at The Oval, he made 123 before lunch on the final day, a tremendous effort and still the most runs in the morning session of a Test match. In 1938 at Lord's, Hammond (240) and Ames (83) added 186 for England's sixth wicket against  Australia, and that winter in South Africa, on his last major tour, Ames again helped his captain in a major partnership. At Cape Town, in the Second Test, the pair put on 197 in 145 minutes for the fourth wicket, both scoring hundreds. Ames finished the series with an average of 67.80 and a career average in Test of 40.56."", 'Ames was a correct player with a fluent classical style; a magnificent driver, especially when moving out to the pitch. When set, he employed the lofted drive over the inner ring of fielders with rare judgement and skill, and he could turn good-length balls into half-volleys on lightning feet. Woe betide any bowler who started dropping short: he would be hammered to the cover boundary, or despatched to leg with powerful hooks or pulls. A superb entertainer, he was popular with spectators up and down the land, but praise or flattery would leave him unmoved: he could never understand what all the fuss was about. Behind the stumps he maintained a consistently high standard. Among his more notable efforts when playing for England were eight dismissals against West Indies at The Oval in 1933, and against South Africa in 1938-39 he conceded only one bye for every 275 balls delivered in the series. On the Bodyline tour he took the thunderbolts of Larwood and Voce with quiet efficiency. His style was unobtrusive; there were no flamboyant gestures. He saw the ball so early that he was invariably in the right position without having to throw himself about. His glovework was neat and economical, his stumpings almost apologetic.', 'During the Second World War, Ames rose to the rank of Squadron-Leader in the RAF and played a little one-day cricket, even taking a hat-trick against Epsom CC with his slow spinners. In the five post-war seasons before his retirement, playing now as a batsman, he enjoyed an Indian summer, adding nearly 10,000 runs to his already formidable aggregate. In 1947, and again in 1948, he made seven hundreds, his total of 2,137 runs in the championship in 1947 being reminiscent of  1933. In 1950 he reached his 100th hundred in brilliant style to win the match against Middlesex during the Canterbury Week, becoming only the twelfth player to achieve this milestone. His batting had lacked none of its old virility and panache, but that winter, captaining the Commonwealth team in India, he was often worried by the back trouble which was soon to end his playing days.', ""Well versed in man management and administrative skills from his war service, he was given charge of three M.C.C. tours -- the 1966-67 Under-25 team to Pakistan, and the senior sides to the West Indies in 1967-68 and Ceylon and Pakistan in 1968-69 -- and he was a selector from 1950 to 1956 and again in 1958, the first professional to be appointed as such. From 1960-74 he was secretary/manager of Kent, a post he filled with conspicuous success, commanding the respect of the players by his sense of discipline and absolute fairness. From years of failure Kent improved steadily until they won the Championship in 1970. The county's second great partnership, with Colin Cowdrey in charge in the middle and Ames working behind the scenes, had had its reward at last, and by now Kent were becoming one of the dominant forces in the limited-overs competitions. Ames was an honorary life member of M.C.C. and was in time elected to the Club's committee. In retirement he remained fit and active, spending many pleasurable days on the golf course, where his natural sense of timing stood him in good stead. If ever there was a true Man of Kent it was he. The attendance of a thousand people at his memorial service in Canterbury Cathedral was a worthy tribute to him.\n""]","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1929', 'Walter Lawrence Trophy 1936', 'Walter Lawrence Trophy 1939', 'Most dismissals in an English season (127 in 1929)', 'Most stumpings (64) in an English season', ""Achieved wicketkeeper's double (1000 runs and 100 dismissals) in each of three seasons (only achieved one other time in English cricket)"", 'Only wicket-keeper to score 100 centuries', 'Made 3000 runs in 1933 season, 2000 runs 5 times, 1000 17 times', 'Record 8th wicket partnership in all tests of 246 with GO Allen', 'Made 123 in the pre-lunch session of the 1923 test against South Africa (a record for runs in a session)', 'Scored centuries against every first-class county apart from Kent']",47.0,72.0,12.0,2434.0,149,40.56,,,8.0,7.0,,6.0,74.0,23.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,593.0,951,95,37248,295,43.51,,,102,176,,,703.0,418.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,593.0,,1383,801,24,3/23,,33.37,3.47,57.6,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

In the last of his 11 Tests, in Barbados in early 2009, Ambrose made an unbeaten 76 and kept tidily enough in tricky conditions as West Indies batted for the best part of 200 overs. \n', 'Sent back to county cricket and ordered to score more runs, he duly made a century for England Lions against the touring West Indies and another against Hampshire in the Championship. But the selectors never rang again. Not even to offer an explanation.', 'Perhaps they felt his batting was over-reliant upon the cut. Perhaps they felt that he was prone to fluctuations in form that rendered him somewhat unreliable. But in an age when many keepers are manufactured, Ambrose was highly accomplished with the gloves and, by jettisoning him when he was just 26, England probably never saw the best of him.', ""Born in Australia, Ambrose utilised the British passport he gained via his mother to move to the UK as a 17-year-old in 2000. He soon signed for Sussex and, as naturally gifted keeper and batsman, he made his first-class debut the following year and, by 2003, the year Sussex won the first Championship title in their history, he had gained the lion's share of the keeping duties from Matt Prior. He also scored more than 900 runs at an average in excess of 40."", ""The contest between the two of them was to be a theme of Ambrose's career. Even though there were times when he took the gloves from Prior for Sussex and England, Prior always returned stronger to reclaim his position."", 'For that reason, Ambrose took the decision to leave Sussex at the end of 2005 and make a new start at Warwickshire. He made a century in his second first-class game for the team and started the 2007 season with a career-best 251 not out against Worcestershire. The England selectors took notice.', ""His Test debut came in New Zealand. After a half-century on debut, he made a century at Wellington in his second match that turned the series in England's favour. But he was unable to sustain that form and, by the time England left for their tour of India, he was Prior's reserve once again. His one return, for that game in Barbados, came when Prior flew home to witness the birth of his first child."", ""Ambrose's form fell away sharply in 2010 and he averaged only 13 with the bat. He later revealed he had been suffering from an episode of depression and, by the end of that season with his contract finished and his love for the game ebbing, he cleared his locker at Edgbaston in expectation that his career was over."", ""Warwickshire were patient, though. With the help of a psychologist, he recovered something approaching his best form in 2011 and then played a key role in his side's Championship triumph of 2012.

He was brought to England at the age six after having been born in Australia, where his family for long practiced law; indeed, his uncle, Reginald Charles Allen, played for Australia in a Test Match against England in 1886-87. As an active cricketer `Gubby' was a genuine and considerable allrounder; Remarkably for one of his relatively slight build, he was a genuinely fast bowler, whose sharpest weapon was the outswinger; a correct, of the tenacious batsman, and a sure-handed close field. He played for Eton- where he was coached by George Hirst and C. M. `Father' Wells- Cambridge University, Middlesex and England. His county career lasted from 1921 to 1950, but he was outstandingly active in the councils of the game until virtually the end."", "" Sir George lived for much of his life in a house only a wall's thickness away from Lord's (he had his own private gate into the ground), whence he wielded immensely powerful influence in the affairs, especially, of MCC and Middlesex. He was a genuine amateur, prevented by his career in business and on the Stock Exchange from playing fulltime cricket. For that reason, capable allrounder that he was, he never scored 1000 runs nor took 100 wickets in a season. Indeed, in his entire career he played only 376 innings; notably, 33 of them were in his 25 Test for England; his batting average overall was 28.67, while he took 788 wickets (81 in Test) at 22.23. Somewhat surprisingly for one who lived to such a good age, from his Eton days he was dogged by injuries; in later life he needed six hip operations - three on each side."", ""He was `blooded' in Test cricket against Australia in 1930 but, although he scored 57, his bowling was unsuccessful and he was dropped for the remainder of the series. He made his mark, though, in 1931, with a quite remarkable innings of 122 against New Zealand at Lord's, coming in at No. 9. He And Leslie Ames set a Test record, which still Stands, with their partnership of 246 for the eighth wicket. In the next match of the series he took 5 for 14; he did not need to bat in that Test, nor in the third."", ""He was taken in Douglas Jardine's side for what has become known as the Bodyline series. Allen, however, disagreed with that version of leg-theory and his captain, meeting a character as determined as his own, did not press his only amateur fast bowler. However, Allen took 21 wickets in that Test series- more than any other English bowler except Harold Larwood. Back home again in 1933, business claimed him for all but one Test against West Indies. Then, in the following season, 1934, the after-effects of a hernia operation restricted him to two Test, in which he made useful but unremarkable contributions. At Old Trafford, in his attempts to avoid the pit dug by Bill O'Reilly's followthrough, Allen bowled a most remarkable first over of 13 deliveries, which included four no-balls three wides - and two unaccepted chances of catches."", '  ', 'He was captain against India in 1936 When England took the three-match rubber by two to one, and his opponent, the Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagram, was Knighted between the first two Tests.', 'Against Australia, on tour in 1936-37 Allen was given the captaincy, for which he had obviously been groomed. He batted and bowled most capably in the first two Tests, Both of which England won. Then Bradman set his seal on the series with scores of 13, 270, 26, 212 and 169 and Australia took the rubber 3-2.', ""Those who follow his career must frequently be baffled by Allen's disappearances from the Test scene, and he did not play for England after captaining them in the Australian series until after the war. He did not play at all in 1937 and turned out for Middlesex in a few matches in 1938. During the war, having trained with the City of London Yeomanry for two years previously, he joined a Royal Artillery Unit and attached for a period to the RAF. Then, characteristically and at his own request, he was taken on a bombing raid over Germany to experience that type of action from the other side."", ' Hammond had by now more or less taken over the post of captain of England, but is was Gubby, ever a glutton for cricket, who took the England side to West Indies in 1947-48 West Indies took the four-match rubber 2-0. Allen, who had made desperate attempts to get cricket-fit again at the age of 45, pulled a leg muscle and could not bowl after his second over of the Third Test. West Indies, however, were markedly the stronger side and Allen a thoughtful but hard-pressed captain.', ""In 1955 he became chairman of selectors, in which post he was conscientious and, at times, quite brilliant. From 1956 he was also chairman of the MCC cricket committee until 1963, when he became the club's president. Apart from the war years, he served on various summer at Lord's from 1932 to 1985 - in latter years he had the own comfortable chair in the committee-room, whereas lesser lights had to make do with straight-backed hard seats."", 'He was not one, however, to seek out solely the positions of obvious importance but he was largely responsible for the move to make a number of outstanding professionals honorary members of MCC.

He had also developed a doosra after working with his friend and sometimes Worcestershire teammate, Saeed Ajmal.', 'But it was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. He made an outstanding, unbeaten century in his second Test, at Headingley, as England went within two balls of saving the series and while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an England spinner in a Test, he struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling in his first three appearances.', ""That changed in training for the Lord's Test against India. Encouraged by team-mate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test offspinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an on-looker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight."", ""It was to prove a pivotal meeting.

Born on November 30, 1857, he was 23 when first appearing for his county. Found in club cricket in Southwark Park, he took some time to accustom himself to new surroundings and his early efforts in first-class cricket gave no idea of the skill which he steadily attained. Very keen, he overcame the handicap of being short and, while maturing his form with the bat, he attracted attention by smart fielding, especially at slip."", 'In his third season with Surrey he advanced rapidly as a batsman and in 1886 against the Australians at the Oval he played a remarkable innings of 144. In 1888--one of the wettest summers ever experienced--he came out first among the professional batsmen of the year, scoring in first-class matches 1,323 runs with an average of 31. Thenceforward his successful career was interrupted only in 1893 when a serious infection of the eyes interfered with his play.

His highest aggregate of runs, 3,309, was obtained in 1901 and his average in these eight years of conspicuous ability ranged from 56 to 41.

This 247 was the biggest score ever obtained in a Gentlemen and Players match until 1925, when Hobbs made 266 at Scarborough. For Players against Gentlemen at Lord's, his highest score was 98 in a memorable match in 1900. Playing first for England against Australia in 1888, he took part in eight Test matches in this country, his best score being 94 at Lord's in 1896."", ""In the winter of 1887-88 when, owing to what may have been a misunderstanding between Sydney and Melbourne, but at the time was generally regarded as rivalry between the cricket authorities, two English teams visited Australia. Abel went with G. F. Vernon's side and scored 320 runs in eleven-a-side matches, average 24. He was not chosen when the two bands joined forces on the occasion when Peel and Lohmann disposed of Australia for totals of 42 and 82. Abel went to Australia again in 1891-92 when W. G. Grace captained Lord Sheffield's side, and he averaged 38 for the eleven-a-side games. At Sydney, in the second of the three Test matches, he accomplished the remarkable performance of carrying his bat through the first innings for 132 but Australia won the contest in which Alex Bannerman, who batted seven hours and a half for 91, received 204 balls from Attewell and scored off only five. Abel visited South Africa with Major Wharton's team in 1888-89 and scored 1,075, average 48--more than twice aggregate and average of any other member of the side."", ""A batsman of great resource and patience, he rarely if ever carried caution to an extreme and for a man of his small stature he was quite a punishing player. Once at the Oval he performed the rare feat of scoring a hundred runs between twelve o'clock and lunch-time. He and Brockwell enjoyed many big partnerships together for the Surrey first wicket, and against Hampshire at the Oval in August 1897, scored 379--a record for an opening stand at that time--265 against Warwickshire at the Oval in September, 1898, 231 against Sussex at the Oval in May, 1897 and 270 (unbroken) against Kent at the Oval in 1900. Other great first-wicket stands in which he shared were 364 with D. L. A. Jephson against Derbyshire at the Oval in 1900, 246 with Tom Hayward against Sussex at Hastings in 1902, and 226 with W. G. Grace for South against North at Scarborough in 1889.

This is the world's record for the fourth wicket."", ""Abel drove hard and cut well, but his special strength came in ability to get runs on the on-side. Very few batsmen have excelled him in scoring in front of short leg with brilliant and safe forcing strokes off his legs. Like many little men, he did not keep his bat perfectly straight, but accurate judgement of length of bowling and quickness on his feet compensated for this defect. A very sure field, notably at slip, Abel also bowled slow off breaks skillfully but was not often wanted in the very powerful Surrey attack. Quiet and unassuming in manner, Abel was never spoiled by success. After one of his great days at the Oval, hundreds of his admirers would gather in front of the pavilion and chant Bob, Bob, Bob, again and again until the Gov'nor bowed his acknowledgements.

But that was nothing compared to the confusion he caused England's batsmen. In a giddy spell on the second afternoon, England lost four wickets for no runs, including three to Enamul. It propelled him straight into the inaugural Test the following week, where, in tandem with Rafique, he bowled with skill and impressive composure to embarrass England's batsmen again. Enamul gives the ball a big rip from a high, economical action, and looks set to be a fixture in the squad for some time. He took 6 for 45 - and the historic final wicket - to send the country wild with an inaugural Test victory over Zimbabwe in January 2005, then added 7 for 95 (and 12 in the match) in the drawn second Test. He was kept out of the firing line in England later that year, but bounced back to play a part as Bangladesh nearly embarrassed Australia in the first Test of their 2006 tour.

Javed Omar is also the only Bangladeshi to have done so, in the country's first overseas Test, against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in 2001. The feat reflects patience and perseverance at the wicket, an element that often went missing for Bangladeshi openers in the first decade of being an elite cricket nation. But the man affectionately known as Golla was never a popular choice: he was maligned as being too slow and dour with his batting, but often did the job that was required of him - see off the new-ball and stabilise the top-order. \n"", ""Hailing from Bakshi Bazar in Old Dhaka, Omar grew up in a family where cricket and football ruled conversations. He preferred the cricket bat and ball, bowling leg-breaks and smashing cuts to the fence, and soon became a regular in the club cricket scene in the early 1990s. One-day cricket never suited Javed, whose batting was of the Trevor Bailey class in obduracy. When Test cricket came around, he wasn't the first-choice opener, with the more fluent but flaky Shahriar Hossain and Mehrab Hossain debuting before him. But his turn came in 2001 when he batted out Bangladesh's second innings in Bulayawo, making an unbeaten 85 after a slower half-century in the first innings."", 'A strong back-foot player with the knack of swiftly hacking and cutting anything short and wide, Javed was slow at building his innings but that was exactly what Bangladesh needed when they looked soft in the early days of Test cricket. His only Test century was a score of 119 against Pakistan in 2003, which gave Bangladesh their first first-innings lead in Tests. The innings came at the back of some low scores that had put him under pressure for a Test place.', 'He had four other Test fifties in Chittagong against Zimbabwe, South Africa, New Zealand and India, and also scored a gutsy 71 against England in Chester-Le-Street during the 2005 tour. He was the only Bangladesh batsman who understood the early summer conditions and made double-digit scores in all four innings.', 'Despite his shortcomings in one-day cricket, Javed managed ten half-centuries, including a sedate 81 off 150 balls against England at Headingley in 2005. He had played enough international cricket to come up with a faster 80 off 117 in 2007 against India just after the World Cup, during which he filled in for the out-of-form Shahriar Nafees in the opening position.', 'He ended his international career after playing against Sri Lanka that year, unable to earn a position in the subsequent series due to his inability to keep up with the pace of one-day cricket.

He was probably waiting for Bangladesh to begin playing Test cricket to fulfill his batting credentials, as the longer game suited him. He struck fifties against New Zealand, England and Zimbabwe, but the innings that typified his contribution was the three-hour-long 33 he made in East London in 2002 in Bangladesh's first Test on South African soil. He negotiated the likes of Makhaya Ntini and Nantie Hayward with guts, even as most of the others struggled. His only Test hundred, against West Indies in the drawn game at Gros Islet, was also to ensure Bangladesh safety in what was also his longest stay at the crease - five-and-a-half hours."", ""The only criticism of Mashud was his stint as captain. The 12 straight Test defeats wasn't his fault, but one of his low points was leading Bangladesh in the 2003 World Cup debacle, particularly the defeat against Canada the day before Eid ul Fitr.

Mushfiqur was principally selected as an understudy to the ever-present wicketkeeper, Khaled Mashud, but his inclusion was further evidence of Bangladesh's determination to build for a better future. He had done well on an A-team tour of Zimbabwe earlier in 2005, scoring a century in the first Test at Bulawayo, and also enjoyed some success in England the previous year with the Under-19s, making 88 in the second Test at Taunton. He showed more evidence of grit with the full team, with a maiden first-class half-century to soften the pain of defeat against Sussex, followed by a career-best 115 against Northamptonshire.

His career hit the rocks shortly afterwards, when his bowling action was reported as suspect, but he bounced back in May 2003, with 6 for 77 against South Africa at Dhaka. It was the best bowling performance by a Bangladeshi in 19 Tests at the time - and only their third five-wicket haul - and it spurred Rafique on to greater things. Later in 2003 he was the leading wicket-taker in the series against England. He can bat a bit too, usually employing the long handle. His 77 at Hyderabad in May 1998 was instrumental in Bangladesh's victory over Kenya - surprisingly, their first in seven attempts - while in May 2004 he carved an astonishing 111 from No. 9 to help secure a precious first-innings lead against West Indies in St Lucia. His 5 for 65 helped Bangladesh win their first Test, against Zimbabwe at Chittagong early in 2005, and he also played a vital role in turning around the one-day series that followed. He was named Bangladesh's Cricketer of the Year for 2004-05, and survived a public training-ground argument with coach Dav Whatmore to play a role in the national side past his 36th birthday. Nine wickets as Bangladesh almost upset Australia at Fatullah in April 2006 edged him towards a notable double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in Tests. Against Zimbabwe in November, Rafique became the first Bangladesh player to complete that double in one-day internationals. He reluctantly announced his retirement in 2008 after being looked over for selection in to the one-day side. However he went off in style by becoming the first Bangladesh bowler to take 100 Test wickets in his final match against South Africa in Chittagong. Post-retirement, he decided to take another shot at competitive cricket by joining the ICL in 2008.

Barely a week after he had made his decision, Iain Cockbain, the new captain, suffered a broken wrist while batting in the nets at Cheltenham.

His selection was initially viewed with suspicion by the local media, who regarded Aftab as something of a one-day cowboy, and indeed his desire to belt the cover off the ball has resulted in some all-too-brief performances. His potential, however, is plain to see, and his selection for the seminal tour of England early in 2005 was evidence of the selectors' faith, which he repaid at Chester-le-Street with a defiant, carefree 82 not out, the highest score for Bangladesh in the Test series. He also finished off the historic one-day win over Australia at Cardiff, smashing Jason Gillespie for four and six to seal victory. His medium-pacers have potential as well, as he showed with an astonishing one-day haul of 5 for 31 against New Zealand in November 2004. He led Bangladesh to a 3-2 series victory with an unbeaten 81 in the final match against Zimbabwe in January 2005. Since then, barring that run-a-ball 82 at the Riverside, he's hit a lean patch: he hasn't reached 30 in a Test, while in one-dayers he hit a couple of fifties against the Kenyans early in 2006, but failed to impress against Australia.

A tall seam bowler, he hits the pitch hard and can get good away movement - but as with many young quick bowlers consistency is his major problem. Technically, he has a good action but a better brace of his front leg through his delivery stride would allow him to make the most of his height, rather than collapsing as he tends to do at the moment. He made his ODI debut against England in October 2004 and caused the England top-order a few anxious moments. His early Test appearances did not set the world alight, and he lost his place after taking 3 for 343 in four matches - but he has the basics and anyone with a semblance of talent should be encouraged and nurtured. Mpofu has benefited noticeably from Heath Streak's appointment as Zimbabwe's bowling coach as his action has smoothed out, his outswing is becoming more consistent (although he still has a frustrating propensity to go too wide of off stump) and his pace has increased. One definite shortcoming, however, is his crease occupation. Not content with being stumped twice in an afternoon (for a pair) in the first Test against New Zealand in August 2005, he followed up by being run out for 3 in the second match, as he strolled down the pitch to congratulate his team-mate on reaching his half-century.  He still tends to blow hot and cold and has few rivals in the race to be considered international cricket's worst batsman, but when Zimbabwe return to Test cricket Mpofu will have an important role to play. \n"", ' \n']",[],15.0,28,10,105.0,33,5.83,249,42.16,0,0,7,5,4.0,0.0,80.0,39,19,46.0,6,2.3,198,23.23,0,0,1,0,11.0,0.0,24.0,7,4,16.0,6*,5.33,30,53.33,0,0,0,1,5.0,0.0,104.0,161,44,1154,57,9.86,3495,33.01,0,1,,,26.0,0.0,178.0,93,42,404,41,7.92,863,46.81,0,0,,,31.0,0.0,71.0,29,15,121,27*,8.64,154,78.57,0,0,6,1,15.0,0.0,15.0,23,2489,1392,29.0,4/92,5/123,48.0,3.35,85.8,2,0,0,80.0,79,3767,3407,88.0,6/52,6/52,38.71,5.42,42.8,2,1,0,24.0,24,515,755,20.0,3/16,3/16,37.75,8.79,25.7,0,0,0,104.0,,16635,8598,280,7/37,,30.70,3.10,59.4,8,10,0,178.0,,8317,6709,229,6/8,6/8,29.29,4.83,36.3,7,3,0,71.0,70,1499,1906,69,4/17,4/17,27.62,7.62,21.7,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

This was against West Indies in 2000-01 when, batting at No. 3 instead of his normal opening position, he scored a composed 119 that was largely responsible for Zimbabwe saving the match after conceding a first-innings lead of 216. Earlier in the year he had not only become the youngest Zimbabwean ever to score a first-class century, but also the first black player in Zimbabwe to do so - a watershed moment in the country's history.\n \nA year later, though, he put his professional cricket career on hold as he began a three-year course at the University of the Free State. Although an agreement was reached that he would still be available for Zimbabwe if required, he could not maintain his form playing against club opposition in South Africa, and the national selectors initially decided to await his return to the country. But the Rebel crisis led to his early recall in the one-dayers against England where, unsurprisingly, he struggled before registering his maiden ODI fifty in the final game. His return to the Test match team brought mixed results, but he was Zimbabwe's best batsman, technically, on their tour of South Africa, where he showed an application lacking in his team mates.\n \nAfter being criticised for not being able to score quickly enough early on in his career, Masakadza's ability in one-day cricket has steadily increased and 2009 was a bumper year for him. He scored over 1000 runs in ODIs in the calendar year at an average of 43.48 and a strike rate of 88.08, including scores of 156 and 178 not out in the home series against Kenya, the first time a batsman has made 150 or more twice in the same one-day series.\n \nMasakadza was part of Zimbabwe's XI when they played their first Test in six years, against Bangladesh in August 2011, scoring his second Test century a decade after his first. He has continued to show greater dexterity as a batsman, adding a hook and pull to a repertoire that already included muscular play off the front foot. He has also added value to Zimbabwe's set-up as a calm, amiable presence amid sometimes tempestuous times.

He wrote the exam that got him into Air Force college. He was one of 60 to have won a place among 60,000 applicants. But in his third year, he failed an eye test. He was told that 7 out of 10 people have the problem in normal life, but for him a dream was shattered.', 'Not dissuaded, Sikandar got admitted to Glasgow Caledonian University, where he picked up cricket as a semi-professional. He moved to Zimbabwe, where his parents had resided since 2002, and he made his first-class debut in 2007. He made one half-century in nine innings before completing his studies and returning to full-time cricket in the 2010-11 season. He had a more fruitful time, scoring 625 runs at an average of 41.', 'The following season was again decent as he developed a reputation as an aggressive top-order batsman. Sikandar kept doing well in the one-day and Twenty20 competitions at the time, so it was natural for the selectors to turn to him for a practice match against the visiting Bangladeshis in 2011 when Vusimuzi Sibanda was injured.

Four months later, he made his Test debut too, against Pakistan in Harare. By the time the 2015 World Cup rolled around, Sikandar was firmly settled into his role as the most adventurous batsman in Zimbabwe's top order, with a fondness for carving the ball through - and sometimes over - point, and a useful side line as an offspinner. "", ""He played a pivotal role in one of Zimbabwe's most memorable moments on a cricket field, winning the deciding ODI against Sri Lanka with a crucial cameo in a pressure situation chasing 204 on a turning track in Hambantota in July 2017.

Like them, he comes from the Harare township of Highfield and earned a ZCU scholarship to Churchill High School. Sibanda is an opening batsman and an occasional medium-pace bowler, and was a student at the CFX Academy in 2002. He scored 58 on debut against the West Indies, but his selection for the national team came too early, and despite failing to live up to his potential, the crisis in the national side meant that he kept his place long after others would have been discarded. Despite being a superb timer of the ball off both the front and back feet, he was slow to learn the ability to build a big innings and his selections were due almost entirely to his outstanding potential rather than actual performance. He has a very sound technique, but poor shot selection has often brought about his downfall. Coach Kevin Curran noted that he matured well on the West Indian tour in May 2006. He suffered a hand injury early on, but took his opportunities when given them, starting the tour with 52 at Georgetown, and finishing with a 78 and then a superb century in the Tri-Series final against Bermuda.  \n', ""He had a successful club season in Sydney, Australia, which seemed to have paid dividends when he registered scores of 47, 93 not out, and 64 in the home series against Bangladesh in February 2007. He could not carry this form into the World Cup, however, and his only innings of note in the tournament was 67 in Zimbabwe's tied game against Ireland at Kingston. He returned to Australian club cricket after the World Cup amid questions over his commitment to international cricket, but subsequently returned to Zimbabwe and was selected for the Afro-Asia Cup, making some impressive starts without being able to push on for a big score. He narrowly missed out on a first ODI hundred against a Test-playing nation when he was run out for 96 against the West Indies in Bulawayo in December 2007, and remained in contention for the national side thereafter with the odd good innings. "", 'Sibanda seemed to have fully matured as a batsman during the 2009-10 Zimbabwean domestic season. He was named as captain of the Midwest Rhinos and called up for the Zimbabwe XI to take on Kenya in the Intercontinental cup game at Kwekwe. Responding superbly, he rescued the Zimbabweans with 209 in the first innings and sealed the victory with an unbeaten 116 in the second. This marked the beginning of a rich vein of form for Sibanda, and he rocketed to the top of the domestic first-class batting tables. Before the end of the Logan Cup, he had taken his season tally to almost 1500 runs at an average of 95 with nine hundreds, including a career-best 215. Tellingly, only once did he pass fifty and fail to reach a hundred. With statistics like those, it is hard to see how he can be left out of the national side, and will likely play a major role should Zimbabwe return to Test cricket in the near future. \n', ' January 2010']",[],14.0,28,0,591.0,93,21.1,1177,50.21,0,2,86,6,16.0,0.0,127.0,126,4,2994.0,116,24.54,4716,63.48,2,21,328,35,42.0,0.0,26.0,26,1,511.0,59,20.44,503,101.59,0,1,52,11,12.0,0.0,134.0,245,12,7695,217,33.02,,,18,33,,,157.0,0.0,250.0,244,13,6006,190,26.00,,,4,39,,,92.0,0.0,72.0,72,7,1584,70*,24.36,1521,104.14,0,8,136,44,29.0,0.0,14.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,11,267,265,3.0,1/12,1/12,88.33,5.95,89.0,0,0,0,26.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,134.0,,2843,1726,39,5/55,,44.25,3.64,72.8,1,1,0,250.0,,809,775,10,2/50,2/50,77.50,5.74,80.9,0,0,0,72.0,3,15,33,0,-,-,-,13.20,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Taylor, disillusioned with international cricket, signed a three-year Kolpak deal with Nottinghamshire which made him ineligible to play for Zimbabwe while that contract is in effect. He made his decision slightly open-ended, not entirely ruling out the possibility that he might one day return to the fold. And he did just that. \n"", '""I was concerned about the future of Zimbabwe cricket and with the administration side of it. I felt people were not qualified enough to run Zimbabwe cricket officially and just the way we were treated as players. It was really difficult to try and play the best cricket you could and deal with the issues.""', 'Those who doubted that he would ever return were proved wrong midway through his final season at Notts when he gained permission for an early release, citing homesickness: his wife Kelly had remained in Zimbabwe with their four young sons. He had a more optimistic attitude towards Zimbabwe cricket, too, anticipating that affairs would be better run on and off the field. At 31, he returned to Test cricket, against West Indies in Bulawayo, nearly three years after his previous innings.', 'Since making his debut in April 2004, Taylor was involved in almost every ODI - the format Zimbabwe play most often - his country has taken part in. In 2008, he missed out on 17 ODIs after making himself unavailable because of a dispute with the board and a year before that he was dropped for the last match of a series in Bangladesh and the return home series because of poor form. But, by and large, 216 matches across all formats (167 of them ODIs with a batting average of 34.82) told its own story.', '\nBut Taylor fell out with Stephen Mangongo, an uncompromising Zimbabwe coach. Firstly, he was stripped off the captaincy in July 2013 when Zimbabwe Cricket suffered one of its regular restructurings and the leadership was split with Elton Chigumbura assuming control in the limited-overs formats. He later relinquished the wicketkeeping role because Mangongo asserted that he preferred ""the best man for the job, not a part-timer"". Finally, in August 2014, he was dropped against South Africa when few anticipated such a move. ""It\'s a professional sport, there is always pressure. It is not Boozer\'s XI,"" Mangongo said pointedly. Eight weeks before the World Cup, Mangongo was sacked and redeployed with the Under-19s but Taylor\'s mind was made up.', 'He was the second Zimbabwe player to go Kolpak after their Test comeback with Kyle Jarvis also signing for Lancashire. ', ""Taylor was appointed captain after the 2011 World Cup, as Zimbabwe worked towards a return from a self-imposed exile from Test cricket. He led them to a successful Test comeback later that year, in which he also scored his maiden century, and to a win over Pakistan a month later. Under Taylor, Zimbabwe seemed a renewed force, despite a sparse fixture list and struggles away from home. As one of the senior-most players in the squad, Taylor played an important part in unifying the players in their off-field battles over unpaid salaries and the formation of a players' association."", 'Taylor shot to prominence at Cape Town on September 12, 2007, his ice-cool 60 not out carrying Zimbabwe to an incredible five-wicket win over Australia in the ICC World Twenty20. Taylor marshalled a tense run-chase with the sort of sang froid that few had ever credited him with.', 'As a young cricketer, he was nurtured by Iain Campbell, father of Alistair, at the well-known Lilfordia primary school near Harare, was a regular choice for national age-group teams and played in two Under-19 World Cups. He made his first-class debut for Mashonaland A at the age of 15; the following year he scored 200 not out in the B Division of the Logan Cup, and he was fast-tracked into the Zimbabwe national team against Sri Lanka in 2003-04 at the age of 18 after the withdrawal of the so-called rebel players. As a batsman he was soon well respected by the opposition, but tended to get out when well set. Poor footwork early in an innings was also a handicap at the start of his career, but he worked to improve that and in November 2009 struck his maiden one-day hundred.', ""That knock proved something of a turning point for him, and in the year that followed he struck centuries against Sri Lanka and South Africa and proved to be Zimbabwe's stand-out batsman at the 2011 World Cup, his trademark uppercut to third man one of the lasting images of the tournament. His star continued to rise as Zimbabwe readied themselves for a return to Test cricket, and in June 2011 he was named captain of the national side."", 'The additional responsibility of captaincy, which he had always fancied, worked wonders for his batting, as he scored four centuries in his first seven Tests in charge, after scoring none in his ten previous Tests. He also scored hundreds in each innings against Bangladesh in Harare in 2013, thus becoming the first from Zimbabwe, and the 12th in all, to achieve this feat. ', ""In July 2014, as part of ZC's split captaincy plan, he retained the Test leadership while Elton Chigumbura took over the limited-overs games. Though he's not very swift in the field, he has a safe pair of hands and kept wicket for Zimbabwe fairly often before Richmond Mutumbami and Regis Chakabva's progress as wicketkeepers allowed him to concentrate more fully on his batting."", ""Taylor's move to Nottinghamshire did not go altogether smoothly. His Championship displays were highly inconsistent.

Earmarked as the long-term successor to club colleague Andy Flower, Taibu was plucked from Churchill Boys High School to tour the West Indies in 1999-00, after impressing onlookers with his natural ability. Three months later he was in England, on stand-by at Trent Bridge after injury put Flower's dual role in doubt. He had yet to play domestic first-class cricket at this stage - his debut for Mashonaland had to be put on hold after he turned up at the wrong ground - but he has toured South Africa with the Zimbabwe U-19s, and was one of Zimbabwe's few bright spots in the 2003 World Cup and their tour to England later that year. A promising batsman, albeit with a penchant for cross-batted strokes, he is steadily improving at Test and ODI level. \n"", ""In April 2004, he was appointed captain of Zimbabwe following the resignation of Heath Streak, and he led a woefully inexperienced by example in the face of repeated heavy defeats.  But the pressure began to tell, and by the autumn of 2005 he found himself at the front of another players revolt, this time widely backed and against the general  mismanagement of the board.  It led to him being villified in the domestic press and threatened by some unsavoury elements connected to the board itself, and in November 2005 he announced his resignation as captain and his retirement from international cricket. Of all the high-profile departures from the game in  Zimbabwe, none were felt so deeply as Taibu - a home-grown product,  a world-class wicketkeeper-batsman, and the country's first black captain.   "", ""After spells in Bangladesh and England, he moved to South Africa later in 2006 and made clear his intention to sit out the four-year qualification to try to play international cricket for them.  But it didn't work out, and to more than a few raised eyebrows he reappeared in Zimbabwe colours in mid 2007."", 'Taibu announced his retirement from international cricket in July 2012, aged 29 years, after a topsy-turvy career spanning more than a decade.

He bettered that a year later when he snared 5 for 48 against Zimbabwe, and in 2008 was West Indies' leading bowler in the Test series against Sri Lanka, with 11 wickets in two matches at 24.81. That helped him bag the Jamaica Cricketer-of-the-Year award for 2008. That year he also blitzed a Test century at just under a run a ball, from No. 8, against New Zealand. "", ""Form on his comeback after back injury in 2014 fuelled his 2015 World Cup dream, where he was West Indies' highest wicket-taker with 17 scalps in seven matches. He was also part of West Indies' World T20 winning squad in 2016. But an unsuccessful run in the longest format in Australia in December 2015-January 2016, when he picked up two wickets in three Tests, resulted in him calling time on his Test career in July 2016.""]",[],46.0,73,7,856.0,106,12.96,1368,62.57,1,1,116,19,8.0,0.0,90.0,42,9,278.0,43*,8.42,323,86.06,0,0,31,5,20.0,0.0,30.0,15,6,118.0,21,13.11,92,128.26,0,0,10,6,9.0,0.0,103.0,161,25,1595,106,11.72,,,1,1,,,25.0,0.0,135.0,68,17,518,43*,10.15,,,0,0,,,27.0,0.0,101.0,41,19,228,21,10.36,194,117.52,0,0,16,12,20.0,0.0,46.0,78,7757,4480,130.0,6/47,9/95,34.46,3.46,59.6,5,4,0,90.0,88,4341,3780,128.0,5/48,5/48,29.53,5.22,33.9,3,1,0,30.0,30,600,863,33.0,3/6,3/6,26.15,8.63,18.1,0,0,0,103.0,,15824,8401,326,8/59,,25.76,3.18,48.5,12,16,2,135.0,,6431,5414,203,5/40,5/40,26.66,5.05,31.6,5,2,0,101.0,100,2152,2952,126,5/10,5/10,23.42,8.23,17.0,2,2,0,False,False,False,False

But they hadn't expected to have to contend with two contrasting top-class spinners as well."", ""It was some of the most inspired selection by any Test side. Before the tour Valentine, who turned 20 shortly after he arrived in England from Jamaica, and Trinidad's Sonny Ramadhin, 21, had played just two first-class matches apiece - the trial games for selection. Although they didn't set the world alight - Valentine took only two wickets, for 190 - they obviously impressed someone, and were called up for the boat trip to the UK."", 'Valentine was tall, and bowled briskish left-arm spin with a whirling action. He ripped the ball savagely: one of his team-mates thought he could probably turn the ball on glass. Ramadhin, meanwhile, bowled a mystifying mixture of offbreaks and legspinners, with his sleeves rolled down (and often with his cap firmly in place).', ""They seemed to bowl almost all summer. The 1950 team's only real weakness was a lack of class in pace bowling, and Ram and Val would soon be wheeling away after a few perfunctory new-ball overs. In all Ramadhin took 135 wickets on the tour at 14.88, and Valentine 123 at 17.94 - the next-best was the medium-pacer Gerry Gomez, with 55 at 25.58. Valentine went for less than two an over throughout: his 1185.2 overs cost only 2207 runs. With Ramadhin sending down over 1000 overs too, both the spinners bowled more than twice as many overs as anyone else, except Gomez (680.3). Valentine must have drained quite a few bottles of the surgical spirit that he applied to his sore spinning finger after a long spell."", 'It was the same story in the Tests. In the first, at Old Trafford, Valentine marked his debut with 8 for 104 (and 3 for 100), taking the first eight wickets to fall in his first Test. But this time the batting misfired, and England won comfortably. Then came the famous Test at Lord\'s - West Indies\' first win on English soil, at Lord\'s too, the match that inspired a famous calypso about ""Those two little pals of mine, Ramadhin and Valentine"". What shocked MCC members almost more than Ramadhin\'s 11 wickets and Valentine\'s seven was the sight of West Indian supporters dancing on the hallowed turf after the game, which their side had won by a whopping 326 runs.', 'With Worrell and Weekes running into form West Indies won the series going away. At Trent Bridge they put on 558 - Worrell himself made 261 - then turned the spin twins loose. Valentine bowled 92 overs in the second innings, a record at the time, and took 3 for 140: Ramadhin (who was later to claim that record) claimed 5 for 135 in 81.2.', ""And West Indies wrapped things up at The Oval with an innings win, despite Len Hutton's double-century. This time Valentine took 10 for 160 - a devastating 6 for 39 in the second innings - to take his series tally to 33 from four Tests, a West Indian record until Malcolm Marshall muscled past it in 1988."", 'Both spinners were shoo-ins as Wisden Cricketers of the Year, and Leslie Smith\'s essay on Valentine probably explains why he was no great shakes as a batsman: ""He scored no more than 49 runs on the tour without ever reaching double figures. This may have been due to the fact that his eyesight was far from perfect. He began the tour without spectacles, but midway through the season another member of the team asked him the score. Valentine said he could not see, despite the scoreboard and the figures being large and clear. Arrangements were then made for him to be supplied with spectacles, which he obtained under the National Insurance scheme, and he wore them for the rest of the tour. He used sticking-plaster near the temples to prevent the spectacles slipping, but with or without them Valentine was a fine bowler and an object-lesson to Englishmen in the value of true finger-spin.""', 'Even with glasses, Valentine never quite hit such heights in Test cricket again, although - again overbowled - he did take 24 wickets in Australia in 1951-52, in a series the Aussies won 4-1 (it would have been much closer but for an unlikely one-wicket victory in the fourth Test at Melbourne). Illness and injuries began to restrict him, and he played only two Tests in England in 1957, without taking a wicket. Nonetheless he was the first West Indian bowler to take 100 Test wickets, finishing with 139 at 30.32.', ""He played in the famous Tied Test at Brisbane in 1960-61, although he only took one wicket. His most important contribution to that match probably came in Wes Hall's epic final over. One ball was pushed towards mid-on, and Hall scampered over himself and fielded it, and unleashed a wild throw that missed the stumps at the bowler's end by yards. Fortunately Valentine was alert, and backed up the throw to stop the overthrows that would have won the game for Australia."", ""But with Lance Gibbs beginning to make his mark - he took three wickets in four balls in the third Test, and a hat-trick in the fourth - Valentine's days were numbered. He toured England in 1963, without playing in a Test, and faded from the scene. He finished with 475 first-class wickets at 26.21 - with a best of 8 for 26 against Lancashire in 1950 - and 470 runs at 5."", 'He played a few seasons of Birmingham League cricket, before moving to America with his second wife in 1978 (his first wife, with whom he had four daughters, had died). A chance visit to a Sydney care home during that 1960-61 tour had made him want to devote his life to helping underprivileged children, and in America the Valentines were foster-parents to a succession of abandoned children, often taking in up to a dozen at a time.', ""Alf Valentine returned to England in 2000 and joined his old pal Ramadhin - who has lived in Lancashire for many years after playing for them in the '60s - for a testimonial event that was not a great success. He had a stroke a few weeks ago while recovering from a back operation, and spent his last days in a wheelchair. He died at his home in Orlando, Florida, on May 11, just 13 days after his 74th birthday.

Though a fine, stylish batsman, it is as a strong captain and an uniting force that he will be remembered. The affection with which his team was received in Australia during the landmark tour of 1960-61 is enshrined in the trophy named after him, which the two teams play for to date. ","['\n', '\nSir Frank Worrell once wrote that the island of Barbados, his birthplace, lacked a hero. As usual, he was underplaying himself. Frank Maglinne Worrell was the first hero of the new nation of Barbados and anyone who doubted that had only to be in the island when his body was brought home in mid-March of 1967. \n', 'Or in Westminster Abbey when West Indians of all backgrounds and shades of opinion paid their last respects to a man who had done more than any other of their countrymen to bind together the new nations of the Caribbean and establish a reputation for fair play throughout the world. Never before had a cricketer been honoured with a memorial service in Westminster Abbey.', 'Sir Frank was a man of strong convictions, a brave man, and it goes without saying, a great cricketer. Though he made his name as a player his greatest contribution was to destroy for ever the myth that a coloured cricketer was not fit to lead a team. Once appointed, he ended the cliques and rivalries between the players of various islands to weld together a team which in the space of five years became the champions of the world.', 'He was a man of true political sense and feeling, a federalist who surely would have made even greater contributions to the history of the West Indies had he not died so tragically in hospital of leukaemia at the early age of 42, a month after returning from India.', 'People in England can have little idea of the problems of West Indian cricket. It is not a question of a few countries bordering each other coming together in a joint team. Jamaica is 1,296 flying miles from Barbados and Georgetown in Guyana 462 miles from Bridgetown in Barbados.', 'Before that wonderful tour of Australia in 1960-1, Barbadians would tend to stick together and so would the Trinidadians, Jamaicans and Guyanans. Worrell cut across all that. Soon there were no groups, Just one team.', ""He told his batsmen to walk if they were given out. When Gary Sobers appeared to show his dissent with a decision, he reprimanded him. After that, everyone walked as soon as the umpire's finger went up."", ""So when half a million Australians lined the streets of Melbourne in their ticker tape farewell to Worrell and his men, they were not only paying a final tribute to the team's great achievements, they were recognising the capacity and potential of equals both on and off the turf."", 'Sir Frank started life in Barbados, worked and lived in Trinidad and died in Jamaica after doing much useful work at the University of the West Indies there. He incurred enmity by leaving his birthplace but he did not care much for insularity, cant and humbug.', 'He saw the many diverse elements of the West Indies as a whole, a common culture and outlook separated only by the Caribbean Sea. This is why he upset certain people in Barbados when he wrote to a newspaper there criticising the island for having the cheek to challenge the rest of the world to celebrate independence.', 'Worrell was strongly criticised for this action, bitterly in fact in some quarters. But being attacked did not worry him. He always had the courage to say what he felt about every issue he thought vital to the well-being of the islands.', 'Sadly, the news that he was dying came through as Barbados played the Rest of the World XI.. But Worrell held no rancour against his homeland. He had bought a piece of land there and had intended to retire there eventually.', 'This willingness to speak out often got him into trouble, even at school. Cricket had come naturally to him as it does to most youngsters in the West Indies, particularly Barbados. More so with him because he was born in a house only a few yards away from the Empire cricket ground. He and his friends used to set up stumps on the outfield and play nearly all day in the holidays.', 'At Combermere School he fell foul of a master who accused him of hogging the crease and not letting his colleagues bat.', 'He was to write later: ""I was unfortunate enough to have been under an endemic psychological and mental strain throughout my school days. So much so that by the time I reached the fourth form I was suffering from a persecution complex.', '""These were the days when child psychology was not a subject demanded of applicants to teachers\' posts. Indeed, the majority of masters did not have the experience of raising families of their own. There was no allowance for the original point of view.""', 'Worrell was a pupil who always had an original point of view. Also, as it was becoming clear at this time, he was a cricketer with an original talent. He soon made the Barbados team and records began to flow from his bat as he moved up the order from number eleven (yes, that is where he began his career!).', 'He shared a partnership of 502 with John Goddard in 1943-4 and an unfinished 574 with Clyde Walcott I 1945-6. Typically, he dismissed both. ""The conditions were loaded in our favour,"" he said. ""I wasn\'t all that delighted about it.""', 'In 1947 he tired of living in Barbados. His mother had moved to New York and his father was away at sea most of the time so he moved to Jamaica. English people will be surprised to learn that many of Worrell\'s fellow Bajans have never forgiven him for this ""betrayal"". When will they ever learn?', 'He established an international reputation against the 1947-8 England touring side and at the end of that tour took the step that made him a batsman for all seasons and all wickets. He signed as a professional for the Central Lancashire League side Radcliffe for a fee of £500 a year.', 'It was a good year to enter League cricket. The Central Lancashire League was a cricket academy and the young, talented player was bound to improve by the experience. Playing in neighbouring clubs were Bill Alley, Jock Livingston, Ray Lindwall, Cecil Pepper, Clyde Walcott, Everton Weekes, Vinoo Mankad and Dattu Phadkar.', 'I have always held that League cricket makes a cricketer, not only as a player but as a man. There is much to learn in the field of human relations from the kind, friendly and warm people of the North of England. Frank brought his fiancée, Velda, over and their marriage was another settling influence on him.', 'Worrell was not just living for the present, but he was thinking of the future. He took a course at Manchester University and qualified in economics, his chosen subject.', 'The flag on Radcliffe Town Hall was at half mast on the day of his death. He married his wife, Velda, at Radcliffe, and their daughter was born there. Such was the esteem in which he was held by Radcliffe that in 1964 a street near the cricket ground was named Worrell Close.', 'The 1950 tour of England was a triumph for him and he topped the Test batting averages with 539 runs at an average of 89.83. His best Test score of 261 was made in this season, at Trent Bridge.', 'Norman Yardley, the England captain of the time, told me it was impossible to set a field to him. Place the fieldsman straight and he beat them on the wide. Place them wide and he would beat them straight.', 'I am not one for averages myself. I am more concerned with how a batsman made his runs and not what his average was at the end of the series. Sir Neville Cardus wrote of Sir Frank that he never made a crude or an ungrammatical stroke. I agree with that. Worrell was poetry.', 'While Walcott bludgeoned the bowlers and Weekes dominated them, the stylist Worrell waved them away. There was none of the savage aggression of a Sobers in his batting. He was the artist. All three ""Ws"" were geniuses but Worrell had the most style and elegance. He had all the strokes and the time and capacity to use them without offence to the eye, without ever being hurried.', 'He was never seen playing across the line. That is why he never hooked. Players and pressmen agreed that even when he ducked beneath a bouncer, he did so with a lack of panic and great dignity. And remember he had Lindwall and Miller to contend with.', 'The tour to Australia in 1951-2 was not such a success as the 1950 tour of England. Worrell himself said this was because there were too many factions in the side and John Goddard, previously showered with advice, was not helped this time by the seniors.', 'When Worrell took over the captaincy nine years later, he was to heed the lessons of this dismal tour. The return series in the West Indies in 1955 was again a disappointment for Worrell; he scored only 206 runs. The 1957 tour of England was a further let down. Clearly the West Indies authorities had to change their policy of always appointing a white man to captain the side.', 'The break was made in 1960 when Worrell, the only candidate with the outstanding qualities to do this gigantic repair job, was asked to lead the side in Australia. Everyone knows the story of that tour and how much it did to restore the good name of cricket after the ""bumper"" rows, ""slow over rates"" disputes and other ills which had been afflicting the international game.', 'Back in Jamaica, Worrell was acclaimed and rightly so. He was appointed Warden of the University College of the West Indies and also a Senator in Parliament.', 'The Indians were the next tourists to the West Indies and it was typical of the man that when their captain, Nari Contractor, was seriously injured by a blow on the head, Worrell was one of the donors of blood which saved his life.', 'It was not generally known that Worrell, the thirteenth West Indian captain, was a superstitious man. During the 1951 tour of Australia he was bowled first ball by Geoff Noblet. Determined to make a fresh start in the second innings, he changed every stitch of clothing, fitting himself out in a completely new gear and walked to the wicket hoping that by discarding his old clothes he would change his luck. Not a bit of it! He was out for another first baler!', 'As he came in, crestfallen, Clyde Walcott, the next batsman, said with a laugh: ""Why do I have to face a hat trick every time I follow you?""', 'His finest hours in England came in 1963 when he led the West Indies to more glory. By this time he had slowed up in the field and his figure was well in excess of Miss World proportions. He was 38 and no longer the player he had been.', ""But his influence over the side as captain was such that it was unthinkable to rest him in any of the Tests. He bowled a few shrewd medium pacers with his deceptively easy delivery and when the crisis was on in the Lord's Test, the greatest Test of all time as it was called by the critics, he helped Butcher to add 110 on the Saturday afternoon. The following Monday morning the second innings collapsed."", 'Asked if Worrell was worried about this, another player replied: ""No, he is asleep."" Sir Frank had this ability to drop off  at any time, particularly when there was a batting collapse.', 'As Wes Hall prepared for the final over which could have won or lost the Lord\'s Test, Worrell went over to him with some advice. What was he saying? Bounce them? Bowl `em straight? No, none of the obvious things. Sir Frank said calmly: ""Make sure you don\'t give it to them by bowling no balls."" Worrell was the calmest man at Lord\'s that day and trust him to think of a highly pertinent point which Hall, in his excitement, may have overlooked.', 'He announced his retirement at the end of this tour which was a triumph of leadership, technical skill and adaptability. The following year he was knighted. It was a fitting end to an unforgettable career but there was one more job for him to do - manage the West Indies side against the 1965 Australian tourists.', 'He had groomed Sobers well for the captaincy and theirs was an unbeatable partnership. At last the West Indies were the undisputed champions in their truly national sport.', 'Throughout his life, Sir Frank never lost his sense of humour or his sense of dignity. Some nasty things were said and written during that 1965 tour but Sir Frank was ever the diplomat. He lost no friends, made no enemies yet won more respect. He would always come up with a smile and a loud laugh.', 'He was a happy man, a good man and a great man. The really tragic thing about his death at the age of 42 was that it cut him off from life when he still had plenty to offer the islands he loved.\n']","['Knighted for services to cricket 1964', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1951']",51.0,87,9,3860.0,261,49.48,,,9,22,,11,43.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,208.0,326,49,15025,308*,54.24,,,39,80,,,139.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51.0,82,7141,2672,69.0,7/70,7/70,38.72,2.24,103.4,2,2,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,208.0,,26740,10115,349,7/70,,28.98,2.26,76.6,,13,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

His debut against England in 1947-48 was unremarkable, and he was dropped to make way for George Headley, although he was restored when Headley had to drop out.  The Kingston crowd wanted John Holt instead of Weekes, and he was booed throughout the England innings.

It would have been six were it not for a controversial run-out decision at Madras.  In England in 1950 his rich form continued with 2310 runs at 79.65 on the trip, including a triple hundred against Cambridge, although in the Tests he made only 338 at 56.33.   His form returned from superlative to good on the tour to Australia which followed, but against India at Port-of-Spain in 1952-53 he made 207 in the first Test and another big hundred on the same ground in the third Test.   He scored heavily against England in 1953-54, and in New Zealand in 1955-56 he hammered 940 runs at 104.44 in eight first-class matches. His tour of England in 1957 was blighted by poor health, and aside from a gutsy 90 on a lively Lord's wicket, when he was struck a painful blow on the hand, he disappointed.   Against Pakistan in 1957-58 he returned to form but he was increasingly troubled by a thigh injury, and after an unsuccessful operation he decided to retire even though he was still in his early 30s.

Sir Clyde Walcott was a member of that multiracial 1950 team and the thrill of it all never dulled for him or any of his contemporaries. (Only Everton Weekes and Sonny Ramadhin remain.) When, almost half a century later, Walcott became chairman of the ICC, based at that same Lord's ground, it rounded off a life full of high achievement. Walcott scored 168 not out in that historic Test and kept wicket while the amazing young spinners Ramadhin and Alf Valentine bowled 231 overs together, 145 of which were maidens, taking 18 wickets against a semi-petrified England line-up that included Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook and Bill Edrich but lacked Denis Compton. Just enough Caribbean folk mustered at Lord's to bring to the historic match a glorious afterglow. \n"", 'Next Test, at Trent Bridge, Frank Worrell (261) and Weekes (129)  completed a vivid enactment for English audiences of the famed Three Ws, a triumvirate unique in cricket history, a combination of power and elegance, each challenging for the title of world\'s best and all born on the little island of Barbados within 18 months of each other, Walcott the youngest, on January 17, 1926. Educated at Combermere School and Harrison College, he had marked his 16th birthday with his first-class debut. When fully developed he resembled another Walcott, ""Jersey Joe"", the American heavyweight boxer. His strokeplay carried the same sort of paralysing punch. At his peak, like Viv Richards later, he was one of those rare power-packed batsmen to whom bowlers preferred not to bowl on a long afternoon. At 20 Walcott made 314 not out in a world-record unbroken fourthwicket stand of 574 with Worrell in an inter-island match at Port-of-Spain. It is not easy to picture him crying ""like a baby"", but by his own account in his autobiography ', '  that is what the heat and humidity did to him as he batted in India for the first time in 1948-49, reaching his hundred with a six he could not later recall. There he made the first and second of his 15 Test centuries (the rapacious Weekes blazing four of five on the trot, starting with the one in the previous series at home against England, and being run out for 90 next innings).', ""The world had nothing to show comparable to the thrilling Three Ws but, when they toured Australia in 1951-52, they were halted, mainly by the hostile bowling of Lindwall and Miller. Only the languid Worrell of the trio made a century in West Indies' 4-1 defeat. Walcott, hampered by back trouble and relinquishing the keeper's gloves, managed only one half-century in his six Test innings. Massive compensation came on Walcott's home pitches. When India visited a year later he hit a 98 and two hundreds and in the following season, in a classic 2-2 series with England, he hammered 220 on his home track and 124 in Trinidad in the fourth Test, when for the second time all three Ws reached three figures in the same innings. Another century in the lost final Test (Garry Sobers's first) took his series tally to 698 at 87.25. And that was still not the peak, for a year later, when Australia visited the Caribbean for the first time, Walcott smashed five awesome  hundreds, twice registering two in a Test. This time his aggregate was 827 (82.70) against the unlikely backdrop of a 3-0 series win by  Australia."", ""Following a miserable series in England in 1957 he had the pleasure of escorting Sobers to his Test record score of 365 not out against Pakistan at Kingston (Walcott was a terrifying vision to be coming in at 602 for 3) and he followed with a century at Georgetown; but after two appearances against England in the sour 1959-60 series his career of 44 Tests ended. His average remains a mighty 56.68. Walcott, who had battered Lancashire league bowling (having an average of 600 for Enfield at one point), worked for cricket's advancement in his native island and in Guyana. He was West Indies tour manager, a selector and then board president before succeeding Colin Cowdrey as ICC's figurehead. In 1993 he was created Knight of St Andrew, Order of Barbados. Finding himself in need of material to lighten the many speeches he was now called upon to make, he once telephoned inquiring after any good cricket joke books. This contrasted intriguingly with the long-ago vision of a young autograph hunter by the SCG pavilion in 1952 who fled when scolded by Walcott for what he perceived as presumption. The reality was that Clyde Walcott preferred to laugh and accompanying the vision of his powerful strokeplay, for those who watched him and knew him, his deep voice resounds still - like his shots, an unforgettable mix of silk and gently rolling thunder. \n""]","[' 1958', 'OBE  in 1966', 'Knighted for services to cricket in 1994']",44.0,74,7,3798.0,220,56.68,,,15,14,,11,53.0,11.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,146.0,238,29,11820,314*,56.55,,,40,54,,,174.0,33.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44.0,22,1194,408,11.0,3/50,3/50,37.09,2.05,108.5,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,146.0,,3449,1269,35,5/41,,36.25,2.20,98.5,,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He began at Canterbury as a no-account batsman and the most parsimonious of medium-paced bowlers, but his batting developed quickly. After becoming a free-scoring one-day player Astle was turned by the national coach Glenn Turner into a first-rate Test top-order batsman, with consecutive hundreds in West Indies in 1995-96. He ripped up the record books with his 222 against England, at Christchurch in 2001-02, which was the fastest double century in Tests, coming up off only 153 balls. A knee injury forced him out of action towards the end of 2003, but he was picked for the tour of England in 2004. Astle is now an assured batsman in both games, an expert slip-catcher, and an occasional medium-pace partnership-breaker. He may be a certain selection, but his laid-back attitude means he has never been considered for the captaincy, despite his seniority. His 10th Test match century was made against Sri Lanka in April 2005, followed soon after by his 11th.  And in September, he became only the tenth man to score 15 ODI centuries, arguably becoming New Zealand's greatest one-day player. In 2006 he signed for Lancashire, although he wasn't at his ballistic best.

Bracewell's 6 for 32 helped the Kiwis to a victory that made them the first side to beat Australia in two series in one winter, and he became the first New Zealand spinner to take a ten-for. He could belt the ball too, and at Sydney earlier in the same winter he bashed 83 not out in a last-wicket partnership of 124 with Stephen Boock.

Cricket, though, was his calling. He lived in a neighborhood which included eventual New Zealand team-mates Kane Williamson and Doug Bracewell, and had the backing of a supportive household that also kept him grounded.', '\nSigns of his skill were evident even as a teenager. As a 17-year old, he was named the fastest secondary school bowler in the country. A year later, he was representing New Zealand at the Under-19 World Cup.', ""\nThe transition to senior cricket, though, was not quite seamless. Boult suffered a stress fracture of the back in 2009 which put him out of cricket for two years and taught him to concentrate on strength and conditioning. There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark. He became one of New Zealand's irreplaceable players across formats and one of many protagonists in the side's march to their first World Cup final in 2015. "", ""\nBoult had a tough time breaking into the limited-overs sides at first, due to a perception that he doesn't move the white ball as much as the red one. But his effectiveness in Test cricket was too compelling to ignore: he raced past 100 wickets in his 29th match and in 2013, only two years since his debut, he was New Zealand's top-wicket taker. With Brendon McCullum placing a high premium on attacking cricket in the shorter versions as well and Boult proving himself as a bowler who preferred getting batsmen out rather than keeping them quiet, it was a perfect fit. Confirmation came in World Cup 2015 when he ended up the joint-leading wicket taker with 22 scalps in nine matches including 5 for 27 in an epic victory over Australia. His worth in T20 cricket was emphasised by a (approximately) $600,000 payday in the IPL."", '\nBoult\'s strength, according to Northern Districts coach John Pamment, is that, ""he\'s got a lovely wrist position and the fact that the wrist goes right behind the ball gives him that control."" Another asset for Boult is friend and sounding board Tim Southee. When on song, their partnership makes for compelling viewing, not to mention telling numbers. In 2014, the pair picked up nearly half the wickets New Zealand took - 67 of 143 - en route to the side\'s most successful Test year, with five wins in nine matches. Boult is also among the few fast bowlers who are exceptional fielders, and has a particular knack for one-handed blinders.', '\n']",['New Zealand Cricket Almanack Player of the Year - 2015'],61.0,76,37,562.0,52*,14.41,1063,52.86,0,1,56,25,36.0,0.0,79.0,35,20,144.0,21*,9.6,190,75.78,0,0,13,6,23.0,0.0,25.0,7,3,14.0,5,3.50,24,58.33,0,0,0,0,12.0,0.0,94.0,116,47,970,61,14.05,1912,50.73,0,2,105,39,51.0,0.0,108.0,49,25,199,21*,8.29,269,73.97,0,0,17,6,33.0,0.0,88.0,19,11,36,5*,4.50,59,61.01,0,0,0,0,39.0,0.0,61.0,115,13591,6776,246.0,6/30,10/80,27.54,2.99,55.2,13,8,1,79.0,79,4290,3632,147.0,7/34,7/34,24.7,5.07,29.1,5,5,0,25.0,25,551,784,37.0,4/34,4/34,21.18,8.53,14.8,1,0,0,94.0,169,19213,9437,354,6/30,10/80,26.65,2.94,54.2,15,16,1,108.0,106,5729,4861,189,7/34,7/34,25.71,5.09,30.3,7,5,0,88.0,88,1895,2651,98,4/34,4/34,27.05,8.39,19.3,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

A batsman of elegance, poise and range, Crowe broke through into Test cricket as a 19-year-old, and in a short span of time was heralded as the best young batsman in the world. By the end of his Test career, he was New Zealand\'s highest run-getter and century-maker, scorer or 10,000 international runs, its captain in the 1992 World Cup who engineered an exhilarating home run all the way to the semi-finals, and a totemic figure in his team\'s feisty Test performances through the Eighties.\n \nThe son of a cricketing family, whose father had played first-class cricket, Crowe came from suburban Auckland, destined for greatness. He arrived a complete batsman still in his teens, a technique burnished in both attack and defence, a fierce competitor alongside a devoted student of cricket with an innate game sense. In his prime, Crowe left the viewer with the impression of having a nanosecond more time to play his strokes, with balance in their execution and equanimity in his stance. He was a batsman of clean lines off the front foot, tall, elegant and classically sound, his signature strokes being down the ground, but capable of shots all around the wicket. His debut season in English county cricket as a 21-year-old replacement for Viv Richards at Somerset was a clear illustration that he belonged. At the crease, Peter Roebuck wrote of him, Crowe could ""soar like an eagle."" \n', ""Along with a clutch of senior players, with Richard Hadlee leading the bowling, Crowe was one of the central pillars of New Zealand's most successful team in history at the time. His 77 Tests and 143 ODIs for New Zealand remain memorable for his prolific batting through the 80s against the world's best bowling line-ups, both home and away, against high pace and quality spin. As captain of New Zealand at the 1992 World Cup, Crowe maximized New Zealand's resources in home conditions, turning the conventional rules of 50-over cricket on their head. He promoted big-hitting Mark Greatbatch up the order to open the batting, and started the bowling with offspinner Dipak Patel.\n \nInjuries ranging from a broken shin, back trouble, torn hamstrings and in latter years, serious knee injuries, plagued him and would end his career. Through this, he produced performances of determination and dominance, part of 16 historic Test victories in which he averaged 55.5, ten runs above his career average. His highest Test score of 299 against Sri Lanka remained New Zealand's highest individual innings for more than two decades before Brendon McCullum's 302 versus India, in 2014. \n \nAfter retirement, he worked in the media, heading Sky's television coverage of cricket in New Zealand for a period of time, invented a new format for the sport called Cricket Max, and worked with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the early years of the IPL. A thoughtful writer and commentator on the game, Crowe remained a mentor and a guide for a younger generation of New Zealand cricketers. Crowe was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2012 and although he was in remission for a time, he suffered a relapse in 2014, and died in 2016 at the age of 53.""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1985'],77.0,131,11,5444.0,299,45.36,12190,44.65,17,18,659,27,71.0,0.0,143.0,140,18,4704.0,107*,38.55,6476,72.63,4,34,378,29,66.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,247.0,412,62,19608,299,56.02,,,71,80,,,226.0,0.0,261.0,256,27,8740,155*,38.16,,,11,59,,,115.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,77.0,35,1377,676,14.0,2/25,3/107,48.28,2.94,98.3,0,0,0,143.0,46,1296,954,29.0,2/9,2/9,32.89,4.41,44.6,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,247.0,,7921,4010,119,5/18,,33.69,3.03,66.5,,4,0,261.0,,3994,2859,99,4/24,4/24,28.87,4.29,40.3,2,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

A burly cricketer and able administrator, he possessed a sharp sense of humour and warm personality, and his death was an untimely blow to New Zealand cricket. Making his début for Canterbury when he was nineteen, as a right-hand batsman and left-arm swing bowler, he went on to play fourteen times for New Zealand between 1952-53 and 1956-66, first as an opening batsman and then lower in the order, scoring 497 test runs at an average of 19.11 with a top score of 76 against South Africa at Cape Town in 1953-54. After a season ( 1950-51) with Central Districts he forced his way into New Zealand's Test side by making an aggressive 165 for Canterbury against the touring South Africans at Christchurch in 1952-53, followed by 88 in the second innings. Of his fourteen Tests, eleven were in fact against South Africa, a country which he toured twice, the second time, in 1961-62, as vice-captain to John Reid. He was a member of the first New Zealand side to win a Test match, against West Indies at Auckland in 1955-56, and in his last Test match, against England at Christchurch in 1965-66, he was New Zealand's captain. Injury then precipitated his retirement, whereupon he became a New Zealand selector until 1970. He also managed the New Zealanders in West Indies in 1971-72 and in India and Pakistan in 1976-77. In first-class cricket he scored 5,344 runs (28.88) and hit four centuries. Switching from seam to orthodox left-arm spin, he also took 142 wickets, one of them in a Test match.\n"", ' \n']",[],14.0,27,1,497.0,76,19.11,,,0,3,,2,10.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,119.0,201,16,5344,165,28.88,,,4,31,,,67.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14.0,5,248,84,1.0,1/24,1/24,84.0,2.03,248.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,119.0,,11064,3559,142,5/24,,25.06,1.93,77.9,,4,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

H. Cave, stood as an umpire in New Zealand's first four Test matches - against England in 1929-30. A member of the New Zealand teams to England in 1949 and 1958, Harry Cave was a popular captain of New Zealand's first touring team to Pakistan and India in 1955-56 when, in the most trying of conditions, he bowled 254 overs at medium pace in the five Tests against India, 119 of them maidens. His return was seven wickets for 412 runs. When the West Indians toured New Zealand later that season, he was again captain for the First Test, but after being unfit for the Second, he graciously accepted John Reid's captaincy for the remainder of the series. With a match analysis of eight for 43 off 41 overs at Auckland, he was a key figure as New Zealand won - at their 45th attempt - their first Test. But perhaps his finest moment came the following season against a visiting Australian B team containing such players as Craig, Simpson, Favell, Burge, Benaud, O'Neill, Harvey and Meckiff. In the three-match series, Cave displayed his mastery with in-swing and a leg-cutter, conceding less than 2 runs an over and taking seventeen wickets at 16.70; the rest of the New Zealand bowlers managed only seventeen wickets between them. For his provincial side, Central Districts, Cave took 150 wickets and in 1952-53, against Auckland, captured seven for 31, his best-ever return, and six for 33 on the same day. An obstinate batsman, he hit two hundreds, the higher being 118 against Otago at Dunedin in 1952-53 when he and Ian Leggat set the present New Zealand record of 239 for the ninth wicket. In his first-class career of 117 games he scored 2,187 runs at 16.08 and took 362 wickets at 23.93.

However, his bowling and batting on the whole lacked the sort of impact that led New Zealand to their first one-day international tournament success, the 2000 ICC tournament at Nairobi. He continued to flourish in 2001-02, helping New Zealand to the VB Series final, but knee and back injuries came back to blunt his form. However, he came back for New Zealand's 2003-04 series against South Africa and announced that the 2004 Test series in England would be his last, but would continue to play one-dayers. New Zealand lost all three Tests, but, suitably, Cairns bowed out at Trent Bridge, his adopted home from his days with Nottinghamshire. In the first Test at Lord's, he passed Sir Vivian Richards's previous record of the most sixes in Test cricket. He played for Notts from 1989 to 1996, and returned in 2003. Upset at missing out on New Zealand's tour of South Africa in September 2005 - his captain, Stephen Fleming, was similar perplexed - he vowed to be fit and available for the World Cup in 2007. New Zealand lost the five-match one-day series 4-0, and Cairns was reinstated for Australia's one-day tour of New Zealand in December. Cairns announced his retirement from ODIs in January 2006 and played his last game for New Zealand the next month.

Thereafter, he got his first international break in 2004, when he made his ODI debut against Bangladesh, while the Test debut followed early in 2006. However, he truly made his mark as an international player only in his second coming, when he returned to the Test side in 2013 after a three-year absence. \n', ""Selected to open the innings in the three-Test home series against England, Fulton was prolific, scoring centuries in each innings in the third Test in Auckland. Before that game, Fulton's highest in 19 Test innings had been 75. The series against England re-established Fulton's credentials as a Test player and showed that he could yet live up to his early potential."", ""Fulton, who has played a lot of club cricket in England, is a product of Canterbury Country, an area rich in cricket history but which had never previously produced an international player. When he first broke into the New Zealand set-up, in 2004-05, he was seen as one for the future. In the ODI series at home against Sri Lanka in 2005-06, scores of 70 not out, 32, 50 and 112 led to a Test baptism: he added 75 in his second match, as New Zealand took an unbeatable lead over West Indies. At the time, John Bracewell, New Zealand's coach, believed he has the tools to open, although he had problems there against South Africa early in 2006. "", ""After being overlooked for New Zealand's initial World Cup games in 2007, Fulton slotted back in as an opener when Lou Vincent flew home. Fulton grabbed the chance and was his team's top scorer three times, including a lone hand of 62 as New Zealand crumbled against Australia. He finished the tournament third on the side's run tally, with 297 at 37.12. Thereafter, a knee injury and inconsistent form kept him out of the national side, till he returned with a bang in 2013.

Back in domestic cricket he worked on his batting, which he had neglected, and filled out generally.  \n', 'He returned to the side in England in 2004. He was playing league cricket in Lancashire, but was called up when Shane Bond went home with a back injury. Franklin was included for the third Test at Trent Bridge, and although New Zealand lost he did his cause no harm with six wickets, five of them Test century-makers. He stayed on for the one-dayers that followed, and picked up the match award at Chester-le-Street for his 5 for 42 as England were skittled for 101. ', ""He was retained for the tour of Bangladesh, and took a hat-trick at Dhaka. Back home he took 6 for 119 against Australia in March 2005, and bowled superbly - getting the ball to reverse-swing - against Sri Lanka a month later, although his figures didn't reflect his excellence. More wickets followed against West Indies, then in April 2006 Franklin did his allrounder claims no harm with an unbeaten 122 - and a stand of 256 with Stephen Fleming - against South Africa at Cape Town."", ""A knee injury hampered his 2006-07 season and he underwent surgery for a patella tendon injury in his right knee. Franklin eased back into competitive cricket by playing Twenty20 and one-day games for Australian Capital Territory and representing New Zealand in the Emerging Players tour of Queensland in October 2008. He made his first-class comeback for Wellington in November with 69 and 4 for 56 in his team's innings victory over Canterbury."", 'He returned to the international team later the same year but struggled to nail down a permanent place, despite performing strongly in county cricket for Gloucestershire in 2009 and 2010. He was part of the New Zealand side that made it to the semi-finals of the 2011 World Cup and expressed his disappointment at missing out on a central contract, though he regained a deal the following year.

He owns a series of records, including the first New Zealander to pass 7000 Test runs, a landmark reached during his final series against England in 2008. During his last innings, in Napier, he did just enough to lift his career average over 40. Nine Test centuries is a poor return for such a talent, but Fleming was worth more than his statistics. \n"", ""A stint with Middlesex in 2001 laid the foundations for a successful re-evaluation of his batting methods where the inability to convert half-centuries to centuries did no justice to his quality. But after a breakout innings of 134 not out to steer New Zealand to a classy World Cup victory over South Africa, along with another spell in county cricket, with Yorkshire, Fleming confirmed his greater batting consistency with a career-highest 274 not out against Sri Lanka in the first Test of their 2003 series. He followed that with an equally impressive 192 at Hamilton against Pakistan later that year and was named New Zealand's cricketer of the year in 2004."", ""The date 26 October, 2004 will remain in Fleming's memory, as he gained three New Zealand Test records in facing the Bangladesh attack at Chittagong. Firstly, his 87th Test earned him the record for most caps won by a New Zealander and, in striding to the crease for the 150th time, this was the greatest number of Test innings for New Zealand. And, as he moved to 81, in an innings where he would strike 202, he surpassed Martin Crowe's record aggregate of 5444 runs in Tests for New Zealand. He launched his first book, "", "" in December 2004 and, in the following season, captained Nottinghamshire to their first county title since 1987. He had a benign tumour removed from his face in December 2005, during Australia's one-day tour of New Zealand."", ""The following May he made his 100th Test appearance, against South Africa - appropriately at Centurion - although failed to mark the occasion with an innings of substance. A wonderful 262 followed at Cape Town but New Zealand were unable to win the match. The World Cup in the West Indies was Fleming's fourth as a player and third as captain and he led New Zealand to another semi-final. That was his final act as one-day skipper, though, as he announced he was standing down from that half of his role but wanted to continue leading the Test side. He spent the off-season playing at Nottinghamshire and dodging questions about whether he would join the Indian Cricket League. In September he announced he would stay on as a New Zealand Test player but retired from ODIs, and at the same time was relieved of the Test captaincy after a decade in charge, in favour of Daniel Vettori. However, after being tempted by the Indian Premier League he announced his international retirement and the series against England was his last.\n"", '\n', ' March 2008']",[],111.0,189,10,7172.0,274*,40.06,15652,45.82,9,46,917,26,171.0,0.0,280.0,269,21,8037.0,134*,32.4,11242,71.49,8,49,823,63,133.0,0.0,5.0,5,0,110.0,38,22.00,85,129.41,0,0,20,0,2.0,0.0,247.0,406,32,16409,274*,43.87,,,35,93,,,340.0,0.0,460.0,437,38,14019,139*,35.13,,,22,86,,,225.0,0.0,53.0,53,3,1157,64*,23.14,949,121.91,0,6,156,22,13,0,111.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,280.0,3,29,28,1.0,1/8,1/8,28.0,5.79,29.0,0,0,0,5.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,247.0,,102,129,0,-,-,-,7.58,-,0,0,0,460.0,,35,31,2,1/3,1/3,15.50,5.31,17.5,0,0,0,53.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

He learnt his trade in the leagues of New Zealand and England, and ground out an unusually dogged hundred on his Test debut against England in 1987-88, and again at Perth in 1989-90, when he staved off what looked to be certain Australian victory, making an unbeaten 146.  He started the 1990 tour of England with hundreds in successive one-day internationals, but his form thereafter was patchy.

Part of the shake-up involved appointing a new coach (Glenn Turner) and this, in turn, led to a change of New Zealand captain. Turner wanted someone with proven leadership skills, who had the respect of the players, and who could maintain discipline both on and off the field by his own example. He had no hesitation in going for Lee Germon, a player with no previous Test experience, but who had been on the tour of South Africa and had proven leadership skills at provincial level. With Canterbury, he was required to take over an ailing team, many of whom were more experienced, and he did an excellent job of moulding them into the best provincial team in the country. He was a keeper who can bat in the lower-middle order, and a place was found for him in the team by converting Adam Parore into a specialist batsman. As a keeper he was a good, if inconsistent, player and he was better standing up. Much of his inconsistency as a keeper could be put\ndown to that.

A neat right-hander with some delightful off-side strokes, he was especially severe on the half-volley, which he would drive unerringly. The younger brother of Hedley Howarth, Geoff was also a fine fielder and a useful offspinner. In 1969 he started a long and frustrating apprenticeship at Surrey, and it was not until 1972-73 that he represented a New Zealand provincial side. Useful performances in the Prudential World Cup of 1975 hinted at his quality, but it was not until 1977-78, possibly his last chance, that he revealed his true ability. He scored 122 and 102 against England at Auckland, saving New Zealand on a worsening wicket. Confident, and sure of his place at last, he kept New Zealand afloat in a seething tide of English seamers in 1978, and in 1980 he captained New Zealand to an outstanding series win over  West Indies. Further triumphs followed, including the first win on English soil in 52 years, and Howarth's astute captaincy and personable nature had a lot to do with it. His career ended in a sad anticlimax in 1985. By then wearing glasses, he was supposedly Surrey's captain, but was not chosen for any Championship matches. Nor was he reinstated as captain of New Zealand. He was awarded the MBE in 1981, and the OBE in 1984, and for a time in the early 1990s was coach and manager of the national team.

He retained his national contract for 2007-08 and found one-day form with scores of 90 and 76 on the South Africa tour before making 88 and 74 from consecutive innings against Bangladesh. A brilliant century followed against England in Napier to suggest his breakthrough as an international batsman although his Test performances remain inconsistent.

He was picked for a trial match after two first-class matches and on the strength of that he toured England under Walter Hadlee in 1949. He started well but sustained a groin strain which meant he was a passenger for the second half of the trip, obliged to remain with the squad.  The first of his 15 Tests came against England in 1950-51 and the following season he produced possibly his best burst when he removed Gomez, Walcott and Worrell in eight balls. In 1955-56 he toured India and Pakistan with success, taking 35 wickets at 32.11 in first-class games where he used the new ball with skill.  He was less successful in the Tests, his 13 wickets in six outings costing 46.61.  He made a second trip to England in 1958 where he took 62 wickets, including 11 in a match against the MCC at Lord's.

The bulk of those came in England's only innings at Lord's where Hayes took his Test-best 4 for 36.

Harris's ability to score all round the wicket, pick the gaps and hit boundaries at just the right time turned him into New Zealand's answer to Michael Bevan, and his 62 not-outs in one-day cricket testify to his ability to close out an innings. His bowling was ideally suited to the shorter game - a gentle medium-pace that forces the batsman to do all the work allied to subtle changes in pace and the ability to cut the ball either way off the wicket. Harris was also a very safe fielder, particularly within the inner circle and in the covers. He hit a purple patch with the bat in late 1997, going 19 consecutive innings (eight of them in ODIs)  without being dismissed and registering three half-centuries. He also played a vital role in New Zealand's triumph at the ICC KnockOut tournament, putting together a partnership of 122 for the sixth wicket with Chris Cairns to set up a last-over win against India in the final. But, again like Bevan, Harris was unable to carry his undeniable talent into Test cricket and his 23 appearances between 1992 and 2002 resulted in a disappointing batting average of 20.44 and an untenable bowling average of 73.12. In 2004, Harris became the first New Zealand player to have played 250 ODIs, although a shoulder injury marred his 250th, and final, appearance. He also remains New Zealand's second-highest wicket-taker in one-dayers, behind Daniel Vettori. At the age of 40 Harris remains an effective player for Canterbury in domestic cricket, although retirement cannot be far away.

Three CBHS old boys, Curly Page, Bill Merritt and Ian Cromb, spoke at a school assembly before they left for the 1931 cricket tour of England. Page said: ""There is no reason why some boy or boys in this assembly should not be in the next New Zealand team to tour England.""', ""That set the course for Hadlee's cricketing saga. He toured England in 1937, and captained that superb New Zealand side in the equally splendid English summer of 1949 with such dedication and determination that anything afterward seemed anti-climactic. After 11 Tests between 1937 and 1951 and 117 first-class matches between 1933 and 1952 Hadlee was already a member of the NZCC board, and maintained that position until 1984. He spent the remaining 22 years with his stalwart wife Lilla (they met on board ship when Hadlee was travelling with the New Zealanders to England in 1937) in mellow autumn, changing his active sport to lawn bowls, and ever ready to work for a worthy cause, be it in cricket, charity or religious good works."", ""Sometimes Hadlee appeared uncertain of New Zealand's future direction.

He blocked the move to appoint a coach for the 1958 and 1965 tours of England at a time when New Zealand desperately needed well-trained players. The fact that the coach in question was Mervyn Wallace, one of his finest batting lieutenants on the 1949 tour, made it all the more disappointing.

","['\nFew players in the history of cricket have carried the fortunes of their team to quite the same extent as Richard Hadlee. By the time he retired from international cricket in 1990, at the age of 39 and with a knighthood newly conferred upon him for his services to the game, Hadlee had cemented his place as one of the great fast bowlers of all time, and lifted New Zealand to unprecedented feats in the Test arena.  \n', 'As the first player to reach 400 Test wickets, Hadlee was always assured of immortality, but in addition to his matchless skills with the ball, he was also a hard-hitting batsman of unquestioned skill, and he is acknowledged as one of the four great allrounders of the 1980s, along with Ian Botham, Imran Khan and Kapil Dev. ', 'One of five sons of Walter Hadlee, the former New Zealand captain, his cricket education began at an early age, and in 1971-72 he debuted for Canterbury, forming a penetrative new-ball partnership with his elder brother Dayle. In those days, however, Hadlee was a tearaway, placing speed far ahead of guile, an attitude that was matched by his unkempt, long-haired appearance. As his knowhow grew, however, so his run-up (and locks) shortened, and all the attributes of the model fast bowler fell into place. His lithe, whippy, side-on action made life uncomfortable for all the great batsmen of his era, as he extracted pace, bounce and movement from even the least responsive of surfaces. ', 'His first great demolition job came in Wellington in February 1978 - five years on from his debut - when his 10 wickets, including 6 for 26 in the second innings, condemned England to a first defeat against the Kiwis. However, it was for the Australians that he preserved his finest efforts, and his 15-wicket haul in Brisbane in 1985-86 remains one of the most talked-of moments in Trans-Tasman rivalry. He needed just 79 matches to reach 400 wickets - a phenomenal strike-rate - and he was still very much at the top of his game when, in 1990, he bowed out against England at his adopted home of Trent Bridge - his second-innings haul of 5 for 53 included a wicket with his very last delivery. ', ""After retirement he went on to to become an outspoken media pundit, and later the chairman of New Zealand's selectors.

May 26, 1921, Wellington ","March 8, 2004, Wellington (aged 82 years 287 days) ",,"['New Zealand,', 'Wellington']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm bowler,,,,"['\n', ""\nWith a very ordinary Test record (14 Tests, batting average of 17.15, 30 wicketkeeping dismissals), Frank Mooney, who died aged 82, might be consigned to history's waste-paper basket. Yet before, during and after his brief career Mooney was an astonishing character - possibly the most colourful character New Zealand cricket has known. Mooney loved the outrageous risk, the impromptu punt on whatever took his and his band of friends' fancy.\nAs a cricketer Mooney was a stylish `keeper and a batsman so determined to make the most of his modest talents that during playing hours he would be as silent and serious as a tomb. Which explained the fact that when the stumps were up Mooney's alter ego, nicknamed Starlight, would be out twinkling round the bars and dance floors of Wellington.\nNot long after his cricket career finished in 1954-55, Mooney re-emerged in the public eye after a spectacular five-figure bet. To win, Mooney had to drive the 410 miles from Auckland to Wellington in under seven hours. In those days the roads were indifferent and mostly back-country. Mooney had a cool planner's brain behind his gamester face. He had a powerful Jaguar engine further super-charged. He arranged for seven petrol stations to be open at small hours of the morning. He started about midnight, rocketed through the night, and was in Wellington about six-and-a-half hours later - without being cited by the traffic police.\nInevitably, the news of Mooney's stampede leaked out. Politicians and senior traffic officers were mightily embarrassed. Mooney forestalled what might have been a manhunt by owning up, paying a modest fine (a small percentage of the bet) on the police belief that at some stage he must have exceeded 100mph.\nNot long afterward Mooney, by now in his forties, and his friends were arguing about the merits of Olympic champion runners Peter Snell and Murray Halberg, both Kiwis, and the magic of the four-minutes mile. No magic, said Mooney. He could run a mile in under five minutes. The betting money poured in. Mooney gained a month to prepare, had an expert design him a four-week crash course training programme - and won the bet with seconds to spare.\nMooney had his ups and downs, in cricket, business and life. If there remained one regret it concerned Lawrence Rowe, the West Indian batsman. Mooney, then a national selector, accompanied New Zealand on the 1971-72 tour of the West Indies. After Rowe, little-known outside Jamaica, had scored 227 for Jamaica against the tourists and 214 and 100 not out in the first Test, Mooney was quickly acclaiming Rowe as the `next Bradman'. Mooney rather implied that he had `discovered' Rowe as a world-class player. Sadly for Mooney, and perhaps world cricket, Rowe did not complete that 1972 series, and later illness did not allow Rowe's genius to develop. As a result, Mooney was never immortalised for discovering the `next Bradman', but he did leave a colourful imprint on cricket history.\n"", ' \n', ""Frank Mooney played 14 Tests for New Zealand between 1949 and 1953-54 and subsequently become a national selector. On the field Monney was taciturn, almost never smiling and rarely speaking; but away from the middle he was the life and soul of the party, and his endless socialising and tireless dancing earned him the nickname Starlight. A neat, undemonstrative wicketkeeper, he made his debut for Wellington in 1941-42, and in 1943-44 played for a New Zealand XI against the New Zealand Services side. But his batting was limited, and he was generally considered to be second or third choice for the national side. His selection as first-choice wicketkeeper for the 1949 tour of England was, therefore, a surprise - dockside workers in Dunedin went on strike, preferring the claims of Otago's George Mills  - but he enjoyed a successful trip, playing in all three Tests and scoring a hundred against MCC at Lord's.  He played against England at home in 1951, West Indies in 1951-52 and South Africa in 1952-53, well enough to keep rivals out of the reckoning. In 1953-54 he toured South Africa, and despite being hampered by a finger injury sustained while exercising on the voyage from New Zealand, he played in all five Tests. He retired at the end of the 1954-55 domestic season.\n""]",[],14.0,22,2,343.0,46,17.15,,,0,0,,0,22.0,8.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,91.0,150,14,3143,180,23.11,,,2,12,,,168.0,54.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14.0,1,8,0,0.0,-,-,35.33,0.00,-,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,91.0,,6,0,0,-,-,-,0.00,-,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Moir was inspired by Bill O'Reilly at Dunedin's Carisbrook ground in 1946. He decided to take up leg-spin bowling and in his 13 seasons of first-class cricket Moir took 368 wickets at an average of 24.56 and scored over 2,000 runs. Apart from his skill as a bowler Moir will be remembered for two particular reasons. The first was when, against England in 1951, he joined the great Warwick Armstrong in the record books having bowled two consecutive overs, the last before tea and the first immediately after. The second, in the following season, caused a lot of debate. West Indian opener Allan Rae had scored 10 runs in a Test match in Auckland when he could have been run out by yards. He had slipped over but Moir refused to take off the bails, simply marching away to his bowling mark. Rae added a further 89 and shared a stand of 197 with Jeff Stollmeyer. Moir never improved on his first Test performance of 6 for 155 against England in 1951,though he also took 5 for 62 against England four years later.

But he picked up a side strain during the game, and was forced to fly home and miss the NatWest Series.

A stylish middle-order batsman, he played 13 Tests and 66 ODIs for New Zealand and made three centuries. But turned his back on international cricket in 2007-08 to play county cricket for Gloucestershire and spent 11 seasons in the West Country before returning home to play for Wellington, at 37, the city in which his career had begun. He enjoyed a steady county career without lighting up the English game that his early promise suggested was possible. \n', 'The 146 he made against Australia in March 2005 proved the high point in his career, not the beginning of greatness some foresaw. He was unshakable against the pace of the mighty Australians at their peak. Another big hundred followed against Sri Lanka and a year later he was signed by Gloucestershire as their overseas player. The cosy life in county cricket proved too attractive and Marshall rejected a central contract for 2007-08, eventually becoming a home-qualified player for Gloucestershire via an Irish passport.', 'It was a disappointment for New Zealand, who first picked Marshall in December 2000 for a Test debut against South Africa. Batting at No. 7 he made an unbeaten 40, showing great maturity and promise. But he was not picked again and had to wait for another three years to get his chance when he was called up for the one-day series in Pakistan in 2003-04. In his third game, he scored an impressive 101 not out in Faisalabad, and later scored 64 and 84 to help New Zealand win the corresponding home series. He then helped New Zealand to win the 2003-04 home one-day series against South Africa, and was called up for the 2004 NatWest Series in England, scoring 75 not out and 55 in the group matches before a solid 44 saw New Zealand win the final against West Indies. ', ""Marshall struggled to hold down a place in New Zealand's ODI side through 2006-07 and although he was not picked in the World Cup squad, he later joined the team as a replacement when Lou Vincent broke his wrist. Marshall played three games in the Caribbean but then sprung a surprise by refusing a national contract."", 'His career with Gloucestershire began as an overseas player in 2006 where he scored 102 against Worcestershire on début and finished the season with 1218 runs at 60.90. That year he also made his highest score for the county, 168 against Leicestershire at Cheltenham. But since making the move permanent he has failed to match that mark and suffered a torrid 2011 season, making only 401 runs in 19 innings. He bounced back to an extent with his first century for three years in 2012 and managed to average 37.36 in a horrendously wet season. He, like many, found the going far easier in 2013 and made over 1000 runs in a season for just the second time in his career, including four centuries, but slipped back in the following season. ', 'The arrival of Richard Dawson as coach was good for him, evidenced by his four Championship hundreds in his farewell Championship summer in 2016. He ended 11 seasons emotionally with a pugnacious 70-odd at Bristol, boosting his career tally to 14,286 runs including 30 centuries.', ""His undoubted highlight in limited-overs cricket was winning the Royal London Cup final against Surrey in 2015, Gloucestershire's first trophy in over a decade. In 2011, along with Kevin O'Brien, he played in the first T20 innings where two players scored centuries; Gloucestershire's 254 for 3 against Middlesex at Uxbridge broke the domestic T20 world record."", 'Marshall also played in the rebel Indian Cricket League in 2008 for the Royal Bengal Tigers.

It was quite a shift after McMillan was dumped at the end of 2005 and began looking for other employment opportunities - including as a salesman. But he regained his limited-overs place for the home series against Sri Lanka in December 2006 and strong performances at the CB Series in Australia, followed by a New Zealand record 67-ball ODI century in the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, ensured his ticket to the World Cup. McMillan impressed with bat and ball in his comeback, which was timely as New Zealand searched for all-round options with injuries to the likes of Scott Styris and Jacob Oram. McMillan, a player who had been gifted international selection from the age of 21, began his career productively and in March 2001 he took a world record 26 runs off one Younis Khan over in a Test against Pakistan at Hamilton. His destructive batting perhaps promised more than he delivered, however, and he was forced to test his resolve when overlooked for a tour of Sri Lanka in 2003. McMillan returned with 83 not out and an unbeaten century in India in 2003-04 to cement his Test spot but 18 months later lost it again and was views as purely a limited-overs option. His World Cup was useful without being outstanding but he was New Zealand's leading run-scorer at the ICC World Twenty20. It was to be his final international tournament, as he announced his retirement at the age of 31 in October 2007. He joined the ICL soon after, captained the Royal Bengal Tigers, quit the league in 2009 and signed a one-year contract with Canterbury.

He broke the ring finger on his left hand taking a catch on the boundary in the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series soon after but made it to the World Cup. His comment that he would 'chop off his finger' to play sparked frenzied reaction in the media but was meant in jest and he went on to average 33 with the bat and 25 with the ball as New Zealand reached the semi-finals.

They won again in 2003-04 and were runners up in 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2005-06.', 'While Patel probably never fulfilled his ability on the international stage, he developed into a highly effective bowling all-rounder at domestic level and has enjoyed a particularly successful spell as a long-term overseas player for Warwickshire, for whom he has produced much of his best cricket. At the end of the 2014 English domestic season - a season in which he had rejected an approach from New Zealand to resurrect his international career - he was named the Most Valuable Player in county cricket.', 'It was a return of 6 for 32 against Otago in the last State Championship match of 2004-05 that propelled him into international cricket. Bracewell took him to Zimbabwe for a one-day tournament in August 2005. He played nine ODIs during the season, but in eight was either the super-sub or the subbed-out player; his batting - at that stage - offered little. At home his 2 for 23 from ten overs throttled Sri Lanka at Wellington, and won him the man-of-the-match award, then three wickets at Christchurch helped subdue West Indies. All this put Patel in line for a first Test cap, which came against South Africa at Cape Town in April 2006. ', ""He performed more than respectably - a five-wicket haul against West Indies at Napier in late 2008 was a highlight - but, with Daniel Vettori's presence limiting opportunities, Patel was generally reduced to the role of substitute or second spinner. He played only six home Tests - in each of them he was second spinner to Vettori - and when he finally had a chance to stake a claim as first choice, he struggled against India, Sri Lanka and South Africa. When New Zealand were thrashed by South Africa - they were bowled out for just 45 in Cape Town - with Patel bowled backing away, it seemed his time was up."", ""But whatever his struggles in international cricket, he proved an inspired choice as overseas player for Warwickshire. After scoring a maiden century on first-class debut for the club in 2009, he returned for every season afterwards except 2010, claiming 185 first-class wickets for the side up to the end of 2014 at an average of just 27.12 and contributing nearly 1,500 runs, too, at an average of nearly 29. He played a huge role in Warwickshire's Championship success of 2012, their T20 success of 2014 and took them within sight of a double of that season with an outstanding spell of bowling against Durham in the final of the Royal London One-Day Cup at Lord's. He finished with 107 wickets in all competitions that year and turned down a recall to the New Zealand squad for the Caribbean tour to ensure he maintained his excellent relationship with Warwickshire. They responded by extending his contract until the end of 2016."", 'Patel duly paid them back with 69 wickets to top the bowling charts for the season. He subsequently made a comeback to the national side when he was picked for the tour of India in September of that year and filled in for the injured Mark Craig for the second Test at Eden Gardens in his first appearance for his country in over three years.', ""In March the following year, Patel played his first Test at the Basin Reserve, his home ground, against South Africa. Two months later, he played his final match for New Zealand, an ODI against Bangladesh in Dublin. Though he made it to New Zealand's squad for the Champions Trophy, he did not play a game.

His form might have been expected to decline with age, but instead the super-fit Parore (who sometimes jogged home after a hard day in the field) reached the peak of his wicketkeeping powers in 2000-01, at the age of 30. In the mid-1990s Parore was often at odds with the New Zealand establishment, and was given to expressive verbal advice from behind the stumps. But he later fitted comfortably into the senior-pro role, both in encouraging the work of the young New Zealand bowlers, and re-polishing his own ability as perhaps the most consistent keeper in world cricket. His batting could occasionally be top-notch too. When Lee Germon took over as captain and wicketkeeper in the mid-1990s, Parore kept his place as New Zealand\'s regular No. 3, and in 2001-02 at Perth he helped Nathan Astle add 253 for the eighth wicket - of which Parore made 110 - against the best attack in the world. Parore described the feat as ""pretty cool"", but by the end of that season his enthusiasm had gone.

A transformed left-arm spinner who turned his game from bowling to batting after suffering the yips, he became a masterful - if slightly dour - opening batsman who thrives on the challenge of holding his place at the crease for as long as he could. His Test average hovered around the 50 mark, and his adhesive qualities played a significant part in several New Zealand Test wins. The only blemish was a failure to convert fifties into bigger scores. But he reversed this trend somewhat on tour in England in 2004, where he struck 93 and 101 in the first Test at Lord's. And during the India tour of 2003 he made his highest Test score of 145, and put on the second-highest opening partnership for New Zealand in an overseas Test when he and Lou Vincent added 231 at Mohali. His after-match challenges to the opposition's slowest runner sometimes outstripped the games themselves for entertainment value.

As a fresh-faced 23-year-old he flew Lancasters for the RAF during the Second World War. According to his crew, Rabone and his men several times side-stepped disaster or death and, when his luck ran out, he parachuted\nfrom his crashing bomber into the arms of a French family who hid him until the liberation of 1944. The other side of the Rabone wartime personality was the fun-loving lad, quick to smile, who loved a beer and a sing-song amid the strong fellowship that warfare brings.  So it was with his cricket. Rabone had many arts - solid batsmanship,\nuseful medium-pace bowling, occasional legspin and long fingers that curled round many brilliant slip catches. He may not have been of Test quality in any cricketing art but few could match his determination. Rabone was 27 but perhaps lucky when he joined the New Zealand side which toured England in 1949. He did well as the spare-parts\nplayer - batting anywhere between No. 1 and No. 7, bowling spin and snaffling 24 catches. The 49ers, led by Walter Hadlee, Merv Wallace, Tom Burtt and Martin Donnelly, were a happy bunch but their time was up and the early-50s men like Rabone, John Reid and Bert Sutcliffe had to fashion a new side to face the hard-headed power of West Indies, England and South Africa at home and South Africa on tour. Rabone won respect as captain in South Africa in 1953-54 but he was again the determined pilot trying to protect his men from the flak. In 1954-55 he spent the first three hours of the first Test scraping together 18 runs against the firepower of England, led by Frank Tyson, in what was merely the start of another losing crusade. A fortnight later came an innings defeat in the second Test at Auckland, when New Zealand were bowled out for 26 in their second innings. Rabone was second-highest scorer with 7. That was the end for the 33-year-old Rabone, who settled into family life and prosperity with Shell Oil. He became an Auckland and national selector and maintained the company of his friends of 1949. He had the final tribute of what might almost be termed a Viking\nfuneral, coming out of retirement for one of the great occasions in New Zealand cricket - the match between Lord Cobham's Governor- General's XI and MCC led by Dennis Silk. This was cricket as Rabone loved it - something to cherish, to put a smile on the face and bring a quick beat to the heart, and not a matter of sporting life or death.

Perhaps, as R. C. Robertson- Glasgow noted, ""Sutcliffe had a more powerful case in his strokes to leg"" whereas ""in defence, Donnelly always looked the surer"". The splendour of their off-side strokes was, needless to say, a given, and their brilliant fielding never ceased to excite attention, with Sutcliffe in his element whether at short leg, in the slips or at cover. Both made manifest again in that austere era some of the more charming cricketing images of the inter-war years. \n', 'Tall and good-looking, fair-haired and enviably fit, batting in the classic manner, Bert Sutcliffe - his given name the homely choice of parents who had emigrated from Lancashire - might well have graced the pages of a novel featuring country-house cricket, not least in that he ever remained an affable man of steady temper. His blondness made him instantly recognisable, while, for the enthusiast, there was much that was identifiable in the shapely, clean-cut dispatch of his shot-making. When Walter Hadlee\'s New Zealanders visited England in 1949, determined to prosecute their case for an end to the insult of three-day Tests, it was in large degree thanks to Bert Sutcliffe that, with four sound draws, the slur was removed. He scored 2,627 runs in that pleasantly dry summer, including 423 at a marvellous 60.42 in the Tests; only Bradman, with 2,960 in 1930, had a higher aggregate on a tour of England. Patsy Hendren, observing Sutcliffe as he warmed up at Lord\'s in pre-tour nets, is reported to have said, ""2,500 in a season if ever I saw \'em.""', 'He made his first-class debut at 18, for Auckland against Wellington in 1941-42 and then spent two years at teacher training college before joining the army. Overseas service in North Africa and Italy found him playing cricket with English spinners Jim Laker and Peter Smith, and the experience would stand him in good stead when peace returned. His teaching career took him to Dunedin, where his 197 and 128 for Otago against the 1946-47 MCC tourists guaranteed his first Test cap a week later, in Christchurch. Putting on 133 for the first wicket with Hadlee, playing majestically until caught behind off Bedser for 58, he launched an illustrious career just as another was drawing to an end, for this would be the final Test of his boyhood hero, Walter Hammond.', 'From then until 1965, when he made his third tour of England, Sutcliffe played 42 Tests, making 2,727 runs with an average of 40.10 and a highest score of 230 not out against India at Delhi in 1955-56. He captained New Zealand in both Tests against the visiting West Indians in 1951-52, and again for the last two Tests in South Africa in 1953-54, having assumed charge of the touring side when Geoff Rabone was injured. If his form on this tour dipped below that expected of such a gifted player, there were still times, Wisden noted, ""when he played in a manner to live in the memory of spectators"". The Second Test at Ellis Park was one of them. Struck on the head by a bumper from Neil Adcock, he gallantly returned, heavily bandaged and pale, to score 80 not out in a total of 187, adding 33 for the last wicket with fast bowler Bob Blair in a partnership charged with emotion and sympathy for the New Zealanders. Two days earlier, on Christmas Eve, Blair\'s 19-year-old fiancée had been one of 151 people killed in a rail accident in New Zealand. A month later Sutcliffe pasted the Border bowling for 196, his only century in South Africa, but there were hundreds against Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria on the way home.', 'It has been suggested that his head injury at Johannesburg subsequently affected his Test batting. But he remained a genuine force in New Zealand cricket. Though he had been absent from Tests for five seasons, at the age of 41 he was included in the 1965 side to tour India, Pakistan and England. His unbeaten 151 at Eden Gardens was his fifth and last Test hundred.', ""In all first-class cricket, he hit 44 centuries in a total of 17,447 runs at a fine average of 47.41. His highest innings, among a series of heavy scores, was 385 for Otago against Canterbury at Christchurch in 1952-53 - at the time the sixth-highest score ever and, until the advent of Brian Lara, the highest by a left-hander in first-class cricket. He had previously made 355 for Otago against Auckland in 1949-50. Six more scores over 200 included 243, followed by 100 not out in the second innings, against Essex in 1949. He also took 160 catches and claimed a stumping. Bert Sutcliffe was New Zealand's first Sportsman of the Year, in 1949, and in 1990 was selected in the inaugural list for the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. The decision to name the country's new cricket academy ground at Lincoln the Bert Sutcliffe Oval was a deeply felt tribute to his heroic part in their cricket history. \n""]","['New Zealand Cricket Almanack Player of the Year 1948', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1950']",42.0,76,8,2727.0,230*,40.1,,,5,15,,16,20.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,233.0,407,39,17447,385,47.41,,,44,83,,,160.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.0,20,538,344,4.0,2/38,2/38,86.0,3.83,134.5,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,233.0,,5966,3273,86,5/19,,38.05,3.29,69.3,,2,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He had nearly 10 years of domestic cricket before he was called up to the Test squad, having made his one-day international debut much earlier. Originally a seamer, a knee injury forced him to take his batting more seriously, and he switched from being a bowler who can bat into being a batsman who occasionally bowls. He was awarded his Test cap on the eve of the Karachi Test in May 2002, only for it to be taken back when the match was cancelled as a result of a bomb blast. When he finally got the chance he scored a century and a half-century on debut against West Indies. On the same tour of the Caribbean he broke the New Zealand record for one-day bowling with 6 for 25 in Trinidad.  He has been encouraged by John Bracewell to work on his offspin as an option which would put less strain on his body, but this has yet to be unveiled. Having spent the best part of 11 years with Northern Districts, Styris signed for Auckland - and in 2005 was tempted by Middlesex for a stint in the county game. He continued a strong link with English cricket, taking up a mid-season contract with Durham in 2007. A thrilling 101 in New Zealand's chase of a then-record 322 against Australia at Christchurch was followed by useful contributions in the one-day series against West Indies at home. A timely unbeaten 103 on and some key wickets on the first day at Auckland saw New Zealand take a series lead in the Tests. A back injury ruled him out of the home series against Sri Lanka in December 2006 but he returned in time for the last few games of the tri-series in Australia and was considered fit enough to be named in the 15-man World Cup squad where he was one of the leading performers with 499 runs at 83. After a poor Test series against South Africa in November 2007, he was dropped from the Test side for the home series against Bangladesh.

Unswervingly single-minded in his pursuit of runs, unashamedly ambitious and often impatient of amateur administrators in New Zealand, his career with Worcestershire was the key to his success everywhere else. He deliberately enrolled in the hard school of county cricket, learnt his lessons quickly and never forgot them. Almost frail-looking, pale-faced and serious-minded, Turner was an immaculately straight-playing opener, who defended with a solidity of technique few contemporaries matched. Although limited in his early days, he eventually played every shot on demand, and scored as fast as anyone when necessary. His most characteristic shots were the off-drive and a beautifully-timed drive to midwicket with the face of the bat turned on impact. He began his Test career with a duck, but the broad canvas of the five-day game suited his tempo and temperament, giving a cultured craftsman the opportunity to build his innings steadily, soberly and coolly. He twice carried his bat through a completed Test innings, and in the West Indies in 1971-72 hit four double-centuries in all matches, including successive innings of 259 at Georgetown. Turner captained New Zealand in ten Tests, but relinquished the job after one of his regular disagreements with administrators. He managed New Zealand's teams in Australia and England in 1985-86, and was reappointed in 1995. He coached Otago and was appointed a national selector in August 2007.

He developed an amazing penchant for taking wickets in the first over he bowled, both in Tests and one-day internationals. A strapping fast-medium bowler in the style of Richard Hadlee's partner of yesteryear Ewen Chatfield, Tuffey impressed as a stronger version and an admirable foil for fast bowler Shane Bond. After a quiet start, he settled into a quality groove as the sort of player capable of performing well on most surfaces. His finest hour to date was 6 for 54 to help New Zealand tie the three-Test series with England in Auckland in 2001-02. A developed into a regular member of both the Test and one-day side, he was picked for New Zealand's 2004 tour of England. However, he then suffered a series of serious injuries including, in 2005, a damaged shoulder which kept him out of the New Zealand side for the best part of two years."", ""Consistent performances in state cricket kept him in the frame, but it was the injury to Kyle Mills which offered him a surprise recall for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy and the 2007 World Cup. His results were distinctly underwhelming, however, and after one World Cup match he slipped quietly home mid-tournament with a recurrence of his previous shoulder injury. He signed up for a stint with the then-unsanctioned, now-defunct Indian Cricket League in October 2007, and was subsequently kept out of international cricket for two years. He returned to New Zealand's Test squad  for the tour of Sri Lanka in mid 2009, but was plagued by injuries thereafter - he suffered broken bones in his hands twice in the following six months, before straining a bicep during a one-day series in India in November 2010. In July 2011, he lost his central contract with the New Zealand board, and injury continued to plague him through the domestic season.

He was installed as captain for the Twenty20 World Championship in 2007 and took over from Fleming as the Test captain ahead of their two-Test tour of South Africa.

It was the one that got away that was perhaps the most memorable, however. At Christchurch in 1991-92, he was one away from what should have been a match-saving century, when he charged down the pitch at Phil Tufnell, and was stumped. Tufnell proceeded to scythe through the lower order, and England won by an innings and four runs with just minutes of the match to spare. ', ""After his playing career, Wright took to coaching, first with Kent, and then taking on a far-more high-profile job as coach of India. It was a tough task, but he gained plenty of goodwill for the honesty and effort he brought into the task. He forged an excellent partnership with Sourav Ganguly, and their partnership brought India some famous victories, most notably against Australia in Kolkata in 2001, a series win in Pakistan and away Test wins in England and Australia. A five-year gap followed the end of his stint with India in 2005, and in December 2010 Wright was appointed New Zealand's coach. That stint lasted less than two years, the highlights of which was New Zealand's first Test win in Australia in 26 years, in Hobart in December 2011, and reaching the semi-finals of the 2011 World Cup. However, New Zealand then lost series to South Africa and West Indies, and with differences emerging with John Buchanan, the director of cricket for Cricket New Zealand, Wright quit the job in July 2012.""]",[],82.0,148,7,5334.0,185,37.82,,,12,23,,10,38.0,0.0,149.0,148,1,3891.0,101,26.46,6804,57.18,1,24,,,51.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,366.0,636,44,25073,192,42.35,,,59,126,,,192.0,0.0,349.0,345,13,10240,108,30.84,,,6,68,,,108.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82.0,3,30,5,0.0,-,-,35.33,1.00,-,0,0,0,149.0,3,24,8,0.0,-,-,32.91,2.00,-,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,366.0,,370,339,2,1/4,,169.50,5.49,185.0,,0,0,349.0,,42,18,1,1/8,1/8,18.00,2.57,42.0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He could bowl his slow-mediums very well, and was a very good field - a 100% team man.""', 'Wallace may also have helped direct the family lives of both Weir and his 1937 team-mate Walter Hadlee.

But it meant a 12-year gap between his third Test and his fourth.', 'He remained a force in Indian cricket, however, scoring 241 for Hindus v The Rest in 1938-39. But when he visited England with the 1946 team, by then rehabilitated, his bowling was more potent than his batting, most dramatically in the first post-war Test, at Lord\'s, when he reduced England\'s first innings to 70 for four by dismissing Hutton, Washbrook, Compton and Hammond. ""After a shuffling run of only three paces, he bowled off the wrong foot,"" said Wisden with slightly shocked admiration, ""but he kept an almost impeccable length, moved his in-swingers probably more than any bowler in England, and mixed these with a cut leg-break of some venom.""', 'The following year he was appointed India\'s captain for their first tour of Australia when Vijay Merchant withdrew. But with Bradman at his most merciless, India were understandably overwhelmed. Amarnath did little himself in the five Tests, averaging 14 with the bat, and taking 13 wickets, although he was magnificent against state sides. His 228 against Victoria contained, Neil Harvey said, the best cover driving he ever saw. He remained captain against West Indies in 1948-49 and in Bombay narrowly failed to lead India to their first Test victory. Then cricket politics again turned against him. There were arguments about money and second-class treatment (the visitors were treated royally; Indian players were dumped in second-class hotels). Amarnath fell foul of the powerful board secretary, Anthony De Mello, who was furious with the man he had dragged ""out of the gutter and made captain of India"" and had him suspended for ""continuous misbehaviour and breach of discipline"".', 'Amarnath sought refuge in the Lancashire League. But he was buoyed by support from Bradman, who called him ""a splendid ambassador"", and by De Mello\'s subsequent fall from power. He was restored, though reduced to the ranks, in 1951-52 and took part when India at last won a Test, against England in Madras; passed over for the humiliating 1952 tour of England; and then given back the captaincy against Pakistan in 1952-53, apparently at the insistence of - of all people - Vizzy. Although India won their first series, Amarnath\'s contributions as a player were minor, and yet more internal machinations meant he left the job in anger. However, the wheel keeps spinning in Indian cricket and Amarnath\'s reputation grew with the years. He became chairman of selectors, most famously insisting on the inclusion of off-spinner Jasu Patel at Kanpur in 1959-60, which led to a historic win over Australia. Lala also supervised the development of his sons: Surinder, too, made a century on debut; Mohinder (""Jimmy"") played 69 Tests. He was a well-informed and humorous commentator, and in old age he acquired widespread affection as the nation\'s leading source of cricket anecdotes. But he never lost his habit of speaking his mind. ""He was an impetuous man,"" said his contemporary, Mushtaq Ali, ""quick to love and quick to fight."" The Indian prime minister, A. B. Vajpayee, called him an icon. \n']",[],24.0,40,4,878.0,118,24.38,,,1,4,,0,13.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,186.0,286,34,10426,262,41.37,,,31,39,,,96.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24.0,35,4241,1481,45.0,5/96,8/167,32.91,2.09,94.2,3,2,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,186.0,,29474,10644,463,7/27,,22.98,2.16,63.6,,19,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

The fact that he was\nthe only Indian in the Rest of the World team that played Barbados in a commemoration match in 1967 speaks of the high regard that the cricketing world had for Borde's ubiquitous skills.

He was also a more than able legspinner, capable of winning matches for India, till a shoulder injury in 1964 curbed his bowling.

One of the best players of fast bowling, Borde made runs consistently and handsomely against McKenzie, Hall and Griffith. He probably reached his peak when he got two centuries in three Tests against West Indies in 1966-67. He failed on the tour of England that followed and had mixed luck on the Australasia trip in 1967-68.

The ingredients were there, and in the right proportions, but never formed a heady and long-lasting mix. Agarkar's entry into international cricket - with an avalanche of wickets that made him the then fastest to 50 in ODIs - was matched for speed only by an astonishing batting slump during which he collected seven consecutive Test ducks against Australia. But he could bat, because tailenders simply do not score half-centuries in 21 balls, as Agarkar did in a one-day game against Zimbabwe, or score Test centuries at Lord's, as Agarkar did in some style in 2002. His aggression was an asset, but his body could not sometimes support it.

He was nearly a leading batsman, he was nearly the best No. 7 batsman India produced (he also batted at No. 3), he scored nearly 10,000 first-class runs, claimed nearly 50 wickets and took nearly 100 catches and was captain of the national side only once. Had Adhikari's connection with cricket ended in 1959, when he was overlooked for the tour of England, that might have served as his epitaph. It was in his second career - as the national coach - that Adhikari rose to his full potential. He was the team manager and the brain behind India's first series win in England in 1971. He shaped the career of cricketers in a two-decade period that saw the rise of, among others, Sunil Gavaskar, Mohinder Amarnath, Dilip Vengsarkar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Ravi Shastri, Kapil Dev and Syed Kirmani. A brilliant cover point in his time, Adhikari was a hard taskmaster who placed physical fitness above all - a concept that was new to Indian cricket which traditionally had been served by talented players who could bat or bowl like a dream, but often escorted the ball to the boundary while fielding. The Second World War delayed Adhikari's Test debut until he was nearly 29 and his official army duties restricted his appearances to 21 of 47 Tests played in his time. A fine player of spin bowling, he made up for a weakness against genuine pace with a large heart that made him the man for a crisis. He was in Indian teams that played inaugural Tests against Australia, West Indies and Pakistan, and his best performances came against these three teams.\nAt Adelaide he made 51 and helped Vijay Hazare add 132 for the seventh wicket while six batsmen failed to score. His only Test century came against West Indies at Delhi in 1948-49 while his 109-run stand with Ghulam Ahmed for the last wicket against Pakistan four years later remains an Indian record. In the notorious home series against West Indies in 1958-59, when India had already used three captains in the first four Tests, Adhikari led in the fifth. He made 63 and 40 and claimed the wickets of Conrad Hunte, Basil Butcher and Denis Atkinson with his gentle leg-breaks. That was his final Test. At 40, he felt he was not up to touring England - where he had acted as vice-captain on India's 1952 tour - again. He was not invited to and DK Gaekwad led the team that lost all five Tests. Adhikari was not a big man yet he was a presence. He will be remembered for his role in Indian cricket's self-confidence movement that began with that series win in 1971.

His progress into the national side may have been steady and methodical rather than meteoric, but once there, Dravid established himself at the vanguard of a new, defiant generation that were no longer easybeats away from home. Armed with an orthodox technique drilled into him by Keki Tarapore, he became the cement that held the foundations firm while the flair players expressed themselves. Yet, for a man quickly stereotyped as one-paced and one-dimensional, he too could stroke the ball around when the mood struck him. \n', ""Never a natural athlete, he compensated with sheer hard work and powers of concentration that were almost yogic. At Adelaide in 2003, when India won a Test in Australia for the first time in a generation, he batted 835 minutes over two innings. A few months later, he was at the crease more than 12 hours for the 270 that clinched India's first series win in Pakistan.\nInitially seen as a liability in the one-day arena, he retooled his game over the years to become an adept middle-order finisher. The heaves and swipes didn't come naturally, but by the time the selectors eased him aside in early 2008, he had more than 10,000 runs to his name in the 50-over game. There had also been a lengthy phase where he donned the wicketkeeping gloves, helping the team to find a balance that was crucial in the run to the World Cup final in 2003."", ""However, it's his Test exploits that he will be most remembered for. After impressing in a Lord's debut where he was eclipsed by Sourav Ganguly, Dravid's breakthrough innings arrived at the Wanderers a few months later, against a South African attack accustomed to bullying visitors. A brief slump followed, but he emerged from that with perhaps one of the most famous supporting acts of all, to VVS Laxman in an Eden Gardens Test that rejuvenated Indian cricket. The half decade that followed was a golden one with the bat, as tours of England and Australia realised more than 600 runs."", ""A two-year stint as captain, following Ganguly's axing, was less successful, though he did lead the side to series victories in England and the West Indies for the first time in a generation. Just when it seemed his best was behind him, Dravid showed his class once again on the tour to England in 2011. In a series in which India were completely outplayed and none of their other batsmen scored more than 275 runs in the Tests, Dravid amassed 461, including three hundreds, two of them when opening the innings against a high-quality pace attack. However, that was followed by a poor series in Australia, which turned out to be his last, as he announced his retirement soon after returning to India."", ""Dravid's immense levels of concentration also came in handy when he was standing in the slips.

He has done so coming from the cricketing backwaters, the mining state of Jharkhand, and through a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scales the highs and lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India have won the top prize in all formats: the No.1 Test ranking for 18 months starting December 2009, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the World Twenty20 on his captaincy debut in 2007."", ' \n', 'Dhoni, then a ticket inspector with the Indian Railways, had escaped all attention bar the odd whisper among the followers of club cricket in Kolkata until he was 23 when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi in 2004. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 within a year of his debut.', ""Dhoni demonstrated all that was right with the new middle-class India. He didn't respect reputations, but never disrespected. He improvised, he learned, but didn't make an apology about his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He still batted with low, hockey hands, he still didn't look elegant but became a multi-faceted ODI batsman, one who could accumulate, one who could rebuild, and one who could still unleash those big sixes."", ""Along the way Dhoni showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up captaincy in 2007. Just before that announcement from Dravid, Dhoni had taken a bunch of kids to South Africa and was leading India to a World Cup win in a format the country didn't even take seriously. The ODI captaincy was natural progression, and Anil Kumble just kept the seat warm in Tests for a year."", ""Dhoni brought to captaincy a thick skin and relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with coach Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they returned the favour with some of their best years in international cricket. His calmness on the field helped and worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although tactically he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests. All that can't argue against the fact that India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under Dhoni, and that Dhoni has for years been among the best few ODI batsmen in the world."", ""However, post the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and his patented helicopter shot, reality struck, and an ageing team kept losing in unfamiliar conditions. After eight straight Test losses away from home, Dhoni the captain came under immense pressure, which was accentuated by a 2-1 home series loss to England in 2012-13, the first time India had lost at home in more than eight years. This brought out a new chapter in Dhoni's career wherein he seemed more assertive as a captain, started building a new team, played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to win four wins in a series. "", '  ', ""Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came close to wins on both tours. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests, dealing with the seam movement and bounce by stepping down the pitch and taking blows on his body.\n \nWins once again proved elusive on the tour of Australia that followed, though India competed ferociously thanks to a young batting core led by Virat Kohli. "", 'Kohli had captained the side in the first Test, with Dhoni injured, and he would lead them in the fourth and final Test too, with Dhoni making a surprise announcement after the third Test in Melbourne that he was retiring from the longest format.\n \nThough his game was not as suited to Tests as it was to limited-overs cricket, Dhoni ended his career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper, with 4876 runs at an average of just over 38, and six hundreds. He had also captained India to more Test wins - 27 - than anyone else. ', 'Dhoni continued to lead India in the shorter formats, and they shrugged off a win-less tour of Australia by reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup. A year later, they won the Asia Cup T20 in Bangladesh but exited the World T20 in the semi-finals, at home. Dhoni enjoyed a good tournament as a finisher, scoring 89 runs while only being dismissed once in five innings; he showed electric reflexes while keeping to the spinners and indicated he could yet play on till the 2019 World Cup, though he gave up the limited-overs captaincy in January 2017. ', ' ', 'Dhoni has also found a new home in the IPL, having been the face of the Chennai Super Kings franchise for the first eight seasons of the tournament, leading them to two titles and four runner-up finishes. He became so deeply associated with the city that he even became a co-owner of a Chennai-based football franchise.

Again, in the final Test at Calcutta, he scored 37 not out at a vital stage to help India avoid defeat.

Sourav Ganguly's ability to polarise opinion led to one of the most fascinating dramas in Indian cricket. Yet, nobody can dispute that he was India's most successful Test captain - forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented, but directionless, individuals - and nobody can argue about him being one of the greatest one-day batsmen of all time. Despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision in his strokeplay, his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at Lord's in 1996. Later that year, he was promoted to the top of the order in ODIs and, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed one of the most destructive opening pairs in history.  \n"", ""When he took over the captaincy after the match-fixing exposes in 2000, he quickly proved to be a tough, intuitive and uncompromising leader. Under his stewardship India started winning Test matches away, and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way to the World Cup final in 2003. Later that year, in Australia, an unexpected and incandescent hundred at Brisbane set the tone for the series where India fought the world's best team to a standstill. Victory in Pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of being a springboard for greater things, it was the peak of a slippery slope. "", ""The beginning of the end came in 2004 at Nagpur - when his last-minute withdrawal played a part in Australia clinching the series - and things went pear shaped when his loss of personal form coincided with India's insipid ODI performances. Breaking point was reached when his differences with Greg Chappell leaked into public domain and his career was in jeopardy when India began their remarkable revival under Rahul Dravid. "", ""His gritty 30s at Karachi, when India succumbed to a humiliating defeat in early 2006, weren't enough for him to retain his spot and some felt he would never get another chance. Others, as always, thought otherwise and they were proved right when he was included in the Test squad for the away series in South Africa in 2006-2007. He  ended as the highest Indian run-scorer in that series and capped his fairytale comeback with four half-centuries on his return to ODIs. He continued his fine run in England, where he finished as the second highest scorer in Tests, and went on to slam back-to-back hundreds against Pakistan at home, the second of which was a glorious 239 in Bangalore. Ganguly was surprisingly omitted from India's ODI squad for the CB Series in Australia and has been out of contention in the one-day squad since. After a poor Test series in Sri Lanka, there were reports of him considering retirement but he was given a lifeline in the Tests against Australia at home.

He opened well in all three forms of the game. He could be more aggressive than Virender Sehwag, played the kind of back-to-the-wall innings that would do Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman proud, and accumulated without taking any risks, much like Sachin Tendulkar has been doing in the last quarter of his career. Either side of that period, though, livid disappointment with his technical flaws dominating his other attributes. Still, with over 10000 runs from his 56 Tests, 147 ODIs and 37 T20Is - not to mention leading Kolkata Knight Riders to two IPL titles - Gambhir has been a grand contributor to Indian cricket.', ' \n', 'Gambhir almost did not make it, ""not wanting to play anymore"" when he was dropped for the 2007 World Cup. For about eight first years of his career, he was the domestic cheque that would not be honoured at international level. While the bowlers on the Ranji circuit swore by this little left-hand batsman, he had just two international centuries to show after 13 Tests and 19 ODIs when he was left out of the World Cup party.', 'He came back with massive runs in domestic cricket, a few important technical adjustments, and with the reputation of being the best player of spin in India, outside the international side. A century in his second ODI back and a final-winning fifty in the inaugural World Twenty20 paved the way for his Test return. Test fifties against Murali and Mendis in the summer of Murali and Mendis in 2008 told him he belonged. In his next 13 Tests, he scored eight centuries: centuries to set up wins, centuries to bat opposition out, and centuries to hold on for draws, including the near 11-hour marathon in Napier. The Arjuna Award came his way, the ICC named him the Test player of 2009, but much more tellingly Sehwag called him the best Indian Test opener since Sunil Gavaskar. He scored a match-winning 97 in the 2011 World Cup final.\n', ""After the World Cup, though, began a more serious, almost terminal decline. As the Indian Test side went from sublime to ridiculous, Gambhir's failures went unpunished. In England and Australia, where India lost eight continuous Tests, Gambhir was a walking wicket, poking at deliveries outside off. From being a captaincy candidate at one time, he went to struggling to keep his place in the side. "", ' ', 'With the arrivals of M Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan, Gambhir was sidelined until an England tour in 2014 when he was called-up as back-up opener. But his return after more than a year out of international cricket ended on a sour note when he was dropped after four innings. Gambhir was on far firmer ground in the IPL - having been a mainstay at Delhi Daredevils and then going to Knight Riders for a record US $2.4 million in the 2011 auction. Gambhir went into the 2016 IPL with 39 fifty-plus scores - the second-most by an Indian in all T20 cricket.

He will be always remembered for his great performance on India's first tour of Australia in 1947-48, when he scored a century in each innings of the Adelaide Test. It was a huge effort against the run of play. Australia had piled up 674 runs, and as Hazare made his second-innings 145, with India following on, six of his team-mates failed to score. Australia won by an innings and 16 runs. \n"", 'Hazare captained India 14 times and finished his career with a batting average of 47.65 from 30 Tests, but it was his Adelaide effort that seems to have made Hazare\'s reputation, for he was always at his best when fighting against the odds. In his first match as captain against England abroad, when India were four down without a run scored against Fred Trueman bowling at his fastest, Hazare stopped the rot for a while, scoring 56. Then in 1950 came what he called his ""most faultless and best innings"" - 115 against the Commonwealth team at Bombay. Jim Laker later recalled that game as his best bowling performance, in the humidity against two well-set batsmen, Hazare and Polly Umrigar.', ""When World War II brought cricket to a standstill, much of the credit for keeping the game alive in India must go to Hazare, who with Vijay Merchant took part in run-scoring duels that drew crowds of 20-30,000 to Bombay's Brabourne Stadium. Hazare's most productive domestic season was in 1943-44 when he scored 1,423 runs. He made scores of 248, 59, 309, 101, 223 and 87, reaching 1,000 runs in only four matches."", 'Hazare was not much of a stylist, having been coached in the outbacks of Maharashtra by Clarrie Grimmett, the great Australian spin bowler. In his autobiography Hazare says that Grimmett was against any alteration in his stance: ""Purists would grumble at my stance. My hands are said to be too far apart on the handle of the bat to permit a free swing. And they say that as my bat is held firmly between the pads, almost locked between them, my strokeplay must suffer. Grimmett must have seen both these peculiarities of mine. Yet, beyond making a few corrections, he strongly advised me against changing my grip and stance.""', 'While he will be remembered mainly for his batting, it is worth recalling that Hazare, who was known for his low round-arm action while bowling medium-pace leg-cutters, held up the bowling end for India when they lacked pacemen. Indeed, in the 1947-48 Adelaide Test a memorable delivery surprised and bowled Don Bradman, though not before Bradman had scored his double century. However, Hazare must have cherished the other time he bowled Bradman, for only 13, in a low-scoring rain-ruined match at Sydney in which India led for the first time in that series.', 'He was a difficult man to talk to, always responding to questions with laconic one-liners or monosyllables. I could never get him to chat about the Delhi Test of 1951-52 against England, when he was accused of playing for the record of the highest score by an Indian, which was then the 154 made earlier in the innings by Merchant (Hazare finished with 164 not out). All he would say was his fielders were to blame for dropping catches, denying India the chance to win the Test. Recently, I asked Umrigar what Hazare had said to him after India had registered their first win over England at Madras in 1951-52: ""You know, Niran, Hazare does not speak much. He just said, `Well played\'."" That was typical Vijay Hazare, who let his bat do the talking.\n', 'Vijay Hazare, who passed away at the age of 89 after a prolonged illness, was one of India\'s early greats who did much on either side of India\'s midnight to put the country\'s batsmanship on the map of world cricket. Along with Vijay Merchant, he brought to Indian cricket a determination and a studied approach that complemented its flamboyance. His finest moment was at Adelaide in 1947-48, where he struck two hundreds against Don Bradman\'s ""Invincible"" Australians.', 'Hazare proved adept on all manner of pitches, off front foot or back. Clean strokes - primarily the cut, hook and a glorious cover-drive -\xad punctuated long periods of defence as he tired attacks before pressing forth. This ability to absorb and release pressure in a controlled manner was unmatched by most in world cricket at the time. He often reined in his carefree strokeplay on the grounds that it was exhibitionism. When fires burned, as they did when Fred Trueman had the new ball in England in 1952, Hazare doused them with calculated calm.', 'But he was no mere accumulator. He crushed spirits with the weight of his runs and the fluency of his batting. In 1943, he struck an extraordinary purple patch in first-class cricket: 264, 81, 97, 248, 59, 309, 101 and 223. The 248 and 309 are significant for his rivalry with Merchant, who bettered the first score by two runs, only to watch the new high score shattered by the triple-century a day later. In 1967, aged 51, Hazare ended his career with a first-class average nudging 58, with 60 hundreds, and a Test average of 47.65.', 'From the Australian tour in 1948 till Pakistan visited in 1953, he averaged over 70 even when his famed concentration suffered due to the captaincy. It is generally said that he was not a natural captain, and that the stress of leading the side at a time when Indian cricket was particularly turbulent took its toll on the silent, thoughtful man. His nature had not lent itself well to captaining a young side. He admitted using sign language to communicate with his fielders. Merchant later declared that Hazare could have been India\'s finest batsman, were it not for the captaincy: ""It was one of the tragedies of cricket.""', ""Though his international bowling record is modest, his medium-pace was a handful in domestic cricket. He knocked over 595 batsmen - 20 in Tests - at less than 25. But his prized moments with the ball were on that tour of Australia, when he breached Bradman's defences twice - an achievement managed only by a handful. This added to his undoubted batting superiority, and defined him as one of the finest to wear India's shade of white.\n"", ' December 2004']",[],30.0,52,6,2192.0,164*,47.65,,,7,9,,1,11.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,238.0,367,46,18740,316*,58.38,,,60,73,,,166.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30.0,43,2840,1220,20.0,4/29,4/29,61.0,2.57,142.0,1,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,238.0,,38447,14645,595,8/90,,24.61,2.28,64.6,,27,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Bowling with a windmilling, whiplash action, remodelled after he was reported for throwing, he deals by varying his length and his pace, and can turn it the other way too. His deadliest ball, however, is the one that climbs wickedly from a length, forcing a hurried jab.

He opened India's batting in 21 of the 34 innings he played, averaging 41 in that position. His Karnataka captain V Subramanya rated Kunderan as a better batsman and wicketkeeper than his contemporary Farokh Engineer. Kunderan played his early cricket in Mumbai but, with Naren Tamhane established as wicketkeeper there, Kunderan turned his attention to Railways. It was a good move. Kunderan was picked to play for India even before he had played a single first-class game and showed his gratitude to his Railways captain Lala Amarnath by scoring a double-century on Ranji debut.  \n"", 'At 20 Kunderan played for India ahead of the older Engineer and gave a glimpse of his approach by getting out hit-wicket to the Australian fast bowler Ian Meckiff while attempting to pull him. ""He took batting into a different dimension,"" says Indian offspinner Erapalli Prasanna. ""The 192 he made in Chennai against England in 1964 was an innings that was ahead of its time - the sort that today\'s big hitters would play.

Kunderan was the first wicketkeeper to score over 500 runs in a series, as he did in that 1963-64 series against England. Three years later he opened injury-hit India\'s bowling in a Test match in England. That was to be his last Test. He was 29. ', ""Rather like the characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Tom Stoppard's play, things happened around Kunderan that he could not control or understand. He started in Mumbai but moved to Railways from where he replaced the Mumbai wicketkeeper in the Indian team. He played innings of coruscating brilliance for his country without any guarantee that he would be picked for the next Test. He was picked when he was not doing particularly well and dropped when he was not doing badly.

No word describes Virat Kohli better. His passion for cricket has made him one of the best batsmen in the world across formats, and has also helped him grow into a ruthless captain. It's also passion that defines Kohli's emotional, effervescent and at times firecracker character. Virat Kohli does not hold back and that remains his strength. \n"", 'Kohli approaches 30 as the most relentless and popular performer in the sport. He is already a World Cup winner (2011), the Player of the tournament at a World T20 (2014) and has led India to a record eight consecutive Test series wins. Purely as a batsman he is already close to the summit: by his 29th birthday he had more ODI hundreds (32) than anyone apart from Sachin Tendulkar (49), and averages 49 or better in all three formats. He is the only batsman to have achieved this feat.', ""He is widely considered to be one of the four great batsmen of his era, the others being Australia's Steven Smith, England's Joe Root and New Zealand's Kane Williamson."", ""In 2012, four years after his India debut, Kohli forced the cricket world's attention upon himself. In the fourth and final Test of a dismal Australia tour for India, who were already 3-0 down, Kohli came to the fore with a composed 116 in Adelaide. It was his maiden Test hundred, and the only century by an Indian batsman on that tour. Later, in the ODI triangular that followed, he uncorked an astonishing, unbeaten 86-ball 133 to help India chase down 321 in 36.4 overs against Sri Lanka. Soon after, he made an ODI career-best 183 against Pakistan in a chase of 331."", ""There is no better batsman than Kohli in chases: he says targets allow him to think clearly and pace his innings. He is unique in that he allies this clarity of thought with a classical batting technique and a supremely confident mindset. A stable head, sure footwork and firm wrists are part of Kohli's arsenal, which helps him play an array of audacious shots."", ""Fluent all around the ground, Kohli is equally confident off the front and back foot. And he isn't shy to move away from tradition and take guard a yard outside his crease, as he did on the tour of Australia in 2014-15. Having been embarrassed by James Anderson in England, he made this technical adjustment on the advice of India coach Ravi Shastri, and scored four centuries including twin hundreds in Adelaide. He finished the series as the second-highest run-getter behind Smith, as Australia won 2-0."", 'Since then, and in no small measure helped by playing Tests at home, India have won series against South Africa, England, Australia and New Zealand while winning away in the West Indies and twice in Sri Lanka.', 'The biggest turning point - and probably the most pivotal moment - of Kohli\'s career arrived on December 30, 2014, when MS Dhoni announced his unexpected retirement from Tests following the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Kohli could not believe that Dhoni would no longer wear whites, and that he would now lead India. The second thought made him cry. ""If you told me when I started playing cricket that at 26 I will be Test captain of India... no chance,"" is how he later described his feelings.', '""A brat, arrogant and casual"" was how Kohli described himself in 2008, when he then became the second India captain to lift the Under-19 World Cup. He excelled in the IPL for Royal Challengers Bangalore, which put him on the world map and made sponsors line up at his doorstep, making him a brand even before he had established himself in international cricket. But as he steadily grew to become India\'s most dependable batsman, and not just a brand, Kohli realised he needed to rid of old, bad habits. He lost weight, gained focus and became a relentless force, supremely fit and quick across the turf, and perhaps the hungriest batsman in the world when it comes to converting ones into twos.', 'The IPL helped Kohli, like many other Indians, play positively. He is certain that his 52-ball 100* in a chase of 360 against Australia in the Jaipur ODI of 2013 (still the fastest by an Indian) was only possible because of his post-IPL mindset. In 2016, Kohli smacked four centuries in the tournament, having not scored even a single ton in his first eight seasons. When Royal Challengers finished as runners-up in 2016, Kohli was just 27 runs short of reaching an unprecedented 1000 runs for the season.', 'Kohli has played with men who presented him awards when he was a chubby-faced schoolboy, and some of the same men have ended up playing under his captaincy. Under Kohli, India have ascended to the No. 1 Test ranking and held onto it with an iron grip while also reaching the joint top position in ODIs. He has set his sights quite a bit higher, though: his quest is to create a legacy like the ones established by all-conquering captains like Clive Lloyd and Steve Waugh.\n']",['ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year 2012'],77.0,131,8,6613.0,243,53.76,11549,57.26,25,20,731,19,72.0,0.0,227.0,219,37,10843.0,183,59.57,11664,92.96,41,49,1019,116,111.0,0.0,67.0,62,17,2263.0,90*,50.28,1647,137.4,0,20,223,54,33.0,0.0,109.0,179,15,8862,243,54.03,15452,57.35,32,28,1044,34,103.0,0.0,261.0,252,40,12285,183,57.94,13200,93.06,45,57,1183,140,129.0,0.0,253.0,239,46,7911,113,40.98,5924,133.54,4,58,727,251,115,0,77.0,9,163,76,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.79,-,0,0,0,227.0,48,641,665,4.0,1/15,1/15,166.25,6.22,160.2,0,0,0,67.0,12,146,198,4.0,1/13,1/13,49.50,8.13,36.5,0,0,0,109.0,23,631,330,3,1/19,2/42,110.00,3.13,210.3,0,0,0,261.0,55,705,726,4,1/15,1/15,181.50,6.17,176.2,0,0,0,253.0,44,454,661,8,2/25,2/25,82.62,8.73,56.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He might not quite have the skills of Wasim Akram, who he has often been compared to, but mentally Zaheer has become as good as Akram.

The new, lethal Zaheer was not only the leader of the Indian attack, he was one of the best in the world. With his guidance, India claimed the No. 1 ranking in Tests and the World Cup in 2011, which he called ""my greatest cricketing moment.""', ""\nZaheer was seen as a vital resource ahead of a lengthy Test season comprising a four-Test tour of England and then a four-Test tour of Australia in 2011-12.

It wasn't until Zaheer's return for the Johannesburg Test against South Africa that India could stem their run of Test losses overseas.

He was a slightly-built opening batsman with the style and panache of the young Azharuddin, and much was expected of him on his Test debut in February 2000. But Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock proved too hot to handle - even though he showed glimpses of a steely and unflappable temperament - and his international career was put on hold. He continued to pile on the runs in domestic cricket and a string of big scores in 2001-02 won him a place on the tour of the West Indies. Once there, he stroked his way to two elegant half-centuries, though a worrying tendency to give it away when well set resulted in his losing his place at the top of the order. He reminded the selectors of his quality with some superb batting for the A team on the 2003 tour of England, but spent three years in the domestic wilderness before being recalled to the squad for the third Test against Sri Lanka in 2005-06. He made most of his first chance on return, against England at Nagpur in March 2006,  notching up his maiden Test hundred and followed it up with a double against  West Indies in June 2006. After losing his place in the Test side to Gautam Gambhir, Jaffer made a strong statement through a bumper Rani season in 2008-09, scoring 1260 runs at 84, including a triple-century.

A fellow Gujarati, Mahatma Gandhi, could well have meant to say this about Ravindra Jadeja. The best of observers ignored his steady left-arm spin at first, then he was ridiculed for his three triple-centuries in Ranji Trophy, the idea of Jadeja the Test player was contested when India gave him debut in 2012-13 against conventional wisdom, but in India\'s series win against Australia, Jadeja won them all over, not least by dismissing Michael Clarke five times in six innings. \n', ""\nThe ridicule of Jadeja's triples - more than any Indian has ever hit in first-class cricket - was actually an indictment of Indian domestic cricket, that a batsman proven to be limited in his days in international cricket could score triples with ease because of the quality of tracks and attacks. However, his record with the ball in ODIs, his fielding, and his rocket arm made him a valuable player in shorter formats, which showed when Chennai Super Kings paid $2 million to secure his services. In August 2013 he topped the ICC's ODI bowling rankings, becoming the first Indian to do so since Anil Kumble in 1996."", '\nShane Warne, his IPL captain at Rajasthan Royals, nicknamed Jadeja ""rockstar"" because of his confidence in his own ability, but his utility lies in his ability to do the dirty work. He is unerring in his accuracy, can bowl overs and overs without tiring, and maximises the natural variation available in the pitch. His fielding and his batting made him an easy pick as a third spinner in Tests in India, a ploy that worked like a charm in India\'s 4-0 win against Australia in early 2013. Clarke, one of the better players of spin going around, will testify, as will 24 wickets at 17.45 in what was his first full series.\xa0', ""\nWhen R Ashwin suffered a dip in form, Jadeja became India's lead spinner on the tours of South Africa and New Zealand in 2013-14 and the first part of their England tour of 2014. While he had his moments, such as a six-for in Durban and a breezy, match-turning 57-ball 68 at Lord's, his bowling was one-dimensional and rarely penetrative on most of the surfaces India encountered. He sat out the fifth Test of the England tour, and flew home early from the Australia tour of 2014-15 with a shoulder injury."", ""\nJadeja's bowling lacked both the accuracy and the bite of old when he returned for the 2015 World Cup, suggesting that his shoulder had still to recover fully. He was left out of the ODI side that toured Zimbabwe in in July 2015, and though it was a second-string squad, the selectors confirmed that Jadeja had been dropped and not rested."", '\nBack in domestic cricket, Jadeja made sure the selectors could not ignore him while picking the squad for the upcoming home Tests against South Africa. In his first three matches of the 2015-16 Ranji Trophy season, all in Rajkot, on dustbowls prepared to maximise the threat of his bowling, he picked up six successive five-wicket hauls - apart from scoring two half-centuries - for Saurashtra. The surfaces that hosted the four Tests against South Africa gave lavish assistance to the spinners, and Jadeja was close to unplayable at times while picking up 23 wickets at 10.82 to help India to a 3-0 series win.', '\nWith the Super Kings franchise suspended for two seasons, the nuts and bolts of the team were dismantled ahead of the 2016 IPL season, with Jadeja finding a new home at Gujarat Lions.\n']",[],41.0,60,14,1485.0,100*,32.28,2299,64.59,1,10,149,40,31.0,0.0,151.0,101,33,2035.0,87,29.92,2416,84.23,0,10,155,37,53.0,0.0,40.0,18,6,116.0,25,9.66,124,93.54,0,0,6,2,18.0,0.0,94.0,138,22,5415,331,46.68,8868,61.06,10,25,577,97,82.0,0.0,204.0,145,45,3084,134,30.84,3574,86.28,2,15,231,64,75.0,0.0,213.0,151,52,2153,48,21.74,1761,122.26,0,0,151,73,78,0,41.0,78,11480,4548,192.0,7/48,10/154,23.68,2.37,59.7,7,9,1,151.0,147,7669,6245,174.0,5/36,5/36,35.89,4.88,44.0,7,1,0,40.0,40,811,983,31.0,3/48,3/48,31.70,7.27,26.1,0,0,0,94.0,168,23448,9538,402,7/31,13/126,23.72,2.44,58.3,17,27,7,204.0,195,10044,7936,235,5/36,5/36,33.77,4.74,42.7,10,1,0,213.0,185,3296,4258,137,5/16,5/16,31.08,7.75,24.0,3,1,0,True,True,False,True

His bustling, street-smart batsmanship in the middle and closing overs swung many one-dayers India's way, none more emphatically than the 1996 World Cup quarter-final against Pakistan, when he blasted 45 off 25 balls. But his obvious vulnerability against genuine pace and swing restricted his Test appearances to 15, and his career was halted in December 2000 by a five-year ban following damaging, though inconclusive, findings in a CBI inquiry on match-fixing. While Jadeja contested the ban, he found an even more glamorous vocation meanwhile: acting. In November 2004 his plea seeking permission to play international cricket was dismissed by the Delhi High Court after no one appeared on his behalf when the petition was taken up for hearing.

It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances.  \n', '\nKarthik was still a giant in domestic cricket though, and had a knack for turning up on turning tracks.

Tall and debonair, often with a kerchief knotted jauntily round his neck, Mushtaq Ali - the son of an Indore police inspector - was a prototype for India\'s modern cricket heroes. In his foreword to Mushtaq\'s autobiography, Cricket Delightful, Keith Miller called him ""the Errol Flynn of cricket - dashing, flamboyant, swashbuckling and immensely popular wherever he played"". He was the first Indian to score a Test century overseas, with 112 at Old Trafford in 1936, when he beat Vijay Merchant to the mark during an opening stand of 203. He reached his hundred inside the final session on the second day, entrancing Neville Cardus, who enthused: ""He transforms the bat into a conjuror\'s wand."" There was one other Test century, 106 against West Indies at Calcutta in 1948-49. Mushtaq had a long career, starting in 1930 and continuing until 1963-64 when, aged 48, he scored 41 off several Test bowlers in a Defence Fund match. In between there were numerous Ranji Trophy finals for Holkar, but just 11 Test appearances. These were spread over almost 20 years and finished with India\'s first victory, by an innings, over England at Madras in 1951-52. Mushtaq\'s contribution was 22 in a useful opening stand of 53 with Pankaj Roy. He should have played more Test cricket, but the authorities were suspicious of him: there was an early mix-up when a selection letter apparently went astray, and later the Calcutta crowd chanted ""No Mushtaq, no Test"" when he was originally left out of a representative match against the Australian Services shortly after the war. He pulled out of the 1947-48 trip to Australia after one of his brothers died, and was not selected for the disastrous England tour of 1952. Even at 37 he might have been useful because, unlike most who toured that year, he relished fast bowling. Later, he was a slim, graceful, elder statesman at many of the multifarious awards nights that punctuate India\'s cricket seasons. Mushtaq\'s son, Gulrez Ali, and his grandson, Abbas Ali, both played first-class cricket.', 'With the death of Syed Mushtaq Ali on June 18, aged 90, the last of the players who represented India before Independence has passed from the scene.', ""Two historic moments ensured Mushtaq's place in Indian folklore. His 11th and final Test at 37 was a momentous one: India's first Test win, against England at Chennai in 1951-52. Previous to that he had become the first Indian to score a century on foreign soil, against England at Old Trafford in 1936."", ""Although loved by the public, Mushtaq played in only 10 of India's 22 Tests since his debut aged 19 at Kolkata against England in 1933-34. He ran foul of the authorities; they felt he had once gone missing without their permission - it was to haunt him and restrict his career. Mushtaq explained that the mix-up had to do with his selection letter going astray but he became a marked man; and, when fans in Kolkata showed their love for him by protesting over his non-inclusion (`No Mushtaq, No Test'), it was probably too much for the fragile egos of the officials who waited for a chance to discard him."", 'Yet the Indore-born batsman was more than the sum of his runs. Playing his early cricket on matting gave him a feel for shots square of the wicket; lack of protection meant he had to develop his footwork to an extraordinary degree. In the words of Ray Robinson, ""The only time he is still is while he takes guard from the umpire. Why he goes through the formality is one of the mysteries of the Orient because, after making his mark, he takes no notice of it."" Tall, loose-limbed, quick of eye and swift of foot, Mushtaq began his Test career as a left-arm spinner batting at No. 7 but opened in the second innings following an injury to the regular opener Dilawar Hussain. It was not a particularly distinguished debut, although he picked up the wicket of Douglas Jardine.', ""India had played six opening combinations in five Tests before Mushtaq and Vijay Merchant came together to open at Old Trafford in 1936. Mushtaq was run out in the first innings for 13 after a drive off Alf Gover deflected off Merchant's bat to Arthur Fagg at mid-on, who threw down the stumps."", ""Then, replying to England's 571 and 368 in arrears, Merchant and Mushtaq finished the day on 190 without loss. Merchant was keen to go for the then world record of 323 but Mushtaq was caught and bowled for 112 early next morning with the partnership on 203. Mushtaq's century was the first abroad by an Indian; Merchant's 114 was the second."", 'During the innings Mushtaq displayed his patented shots - the pull and the casual walk out to the fast bowler that unsettled him and thrilled the spectators. ""We could understand how a Ranji flowered from this field of play,"" wrote Neville Cardus. ""The batting has paid rare tribute to cricket\'s loveliness, its art and originality.""', ""The Merchant-Mushtaq association averaged 83.43, on either side of the war. Merchant declined the tour to Bradman's Australia in 1947-48 while Mushtaq, nominated vice-captain, pulled out after the death of his brother. He could still have made it after the mourning period as the team had not left. The Maharajah of Holkar was prepared to meet Mushtaq's travelling expenses but the board did not want him. So India undertook a difficult tour without a pair of recognised openers; and Mushtaq Ali realised, if he had not before, that he was not the blue-eyed boy of the board."", ""For more than half a century Mushtaq kept silent over matters that reduced his international career, although he played first-class cricket until 1963. When he died at his home in Indore, he was one of cricket's most beloved gentlemen. \n""]",[],11.0,20,1,612.0,112,32.21,,,2,3,,0,7.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,226.0,384,16,13213,233,35.90,,,30,63,,,160.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,5,378,202,3.0,1/45,1/45,67.33,3.20,126.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,226.0,,9581,4754,162,7/108,,29.34,2.97,59.1,,6,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Friendly, modest and unassuming by nature, he has always been one of the easily approachable cricketers. But once the action starts, Mongia has always been dead serious about the game. A professional approach marks his batting and wicketkeeping. On his first tour of England in 1990 he impressed no less a personality than Alan Knott, who judged him to be a natural. After a fairly long spell as understudy to Kiran More, Mongia made it to the Indian team in the mid 90s and from then on was been India's No. 1. An efficent wicketkeeper, Mongia is equally at home keeping to Srinath or Kumble. He has displayed lightning quick reflexes while diving to complete a catch or while bringing off a smart stumping. As a batsman, Mongia has proved time and again his immense value to the side in the middle order. But he has had success while opening the innings too, a fact symbolised by his gallant 152 against Australia at New Delhi in 1996.

He had played only 15 first-class and 15 List A games when he was drafted into India's ODI team to play Pakistan in Delhi in January 2013. He showed the faith wasn't misplaced and returned figures of 9-4-23-1 in a 10-run win, thus becoming only the eighth bowler, and the first Indian, to bowl four or more maiden overs on his ODI debut. His Test debut, which happened in November that year against the touring West Indies, was even more spectacular. He reverse-swung the old ball appreciably,  and at good pace, in the two-match series to take 11 wickets at 16.54. In the summer that followed in England, Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, recorded the second-highest 10th wicket partnership for India in Tests, when they put on 111 runs against England in Nottingham.

However, with two giant spinners - Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh - at the peak of their powers, there wasn't a place available for him in India's squad. \n"", ""Mishra made his international debut in 2003 during an ODI triangular in Bangladesh, but he had to wait until 2008 to get his first go in Tests. That opportunity came after an injury forced Kumble out of the Mohali Test against Australia. Mishra had a dream start to his Test career, becoming the sixth Indian to take a five-wicket haul on debut, foxing the Australians with his variations and finishing the series with 14 wickets from three Tests. With his debut series coinciding with Kumble's last, it was the opening he needed to establish himself as India's first-choice legspinner. But, his inability to extract turn on benign pitches and the lack of accuracy were his failings as other spinners overtook him in the pecking order.

But, it's his performances in the IPL, where he has been one of the best spinners, and the only bowler to pick up three hat-tricks, that keep him in the limelight. The hat-tricks came for three different teams - Delhi Daredevils (2008), Deccan Chargers (2011) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (2013). In 2015, Mishra returned to the team he first played for, with Daredevils paying INR 3.5 crore to secure his services."", ""A strong display in the 2013 IPL, during which he kept the batsmen guessing with his variations in flight and pace, earned him a call-up for India's ODI squad for the Champions Trophy in England and the tour to Zimbabwe, almost two years after his last international appearance. He didn't disappoint, picking up 18 wickets at 11.61 in five ODIs against Zimbabwe, and equaling Javagal Srinath's record for the most wickets in a bilateral series. Mishra's good form continued into the World T20 the following year in Bangladesh, where he picked up 10 wickets at 14.70, while only conceding 6.68 runs per over, as India adopted a three-spinner strategy and finished runners-up to Sri Lanka."", ""With younger options thin on the ground, India recalled Mishra to the Test side for their 2015 tour of Sri Lanka.

He made five centuries and twice took eight wickets in an innings. Against New Zealand at Madras in 1955-56 he scored 231, and with P Roy put on 413 for the first wicket, a record for any Test. His average for that series was 105. When India gained their first victory over England, at Madras in 1952, his bowling was almost wholly responsible. On a wicket which gave him little assistance he took eight for 55 and four for 53. His most famous feat was against England at  Lord's in 1952 when going in first he scored 72 and 184. In the second innings he went straight to the wicket after bowling 31 overs that day. In the whole match he bowled 97 overs and took five for 231. England won by eight wickets, but Mankad's performance must surely rank as the greatest ever done in a Test by a member of the losing side.

In 1946 for India in England he made 1120 runs and took 129 wickets. He remains the only Indian ever to have accomplished this feat and no member of any touring side has achieved it since. In 1947 he went into League Cricket and, though he remained available in India during the winter, when they came to England in 1952, he was released for the Tests only. Indeed the Lord's Test was his first first-class match that season. He captained India in  Pakistan in 1954-55. In his first-class career, which ended in 1962, he scored 11,480 runs with an average of 34.78 and took 774 wickets at 24.60."", ""As a batsman, he had great powers of concentration and a strong defence. His record stand with Roy lasted over eight hours and they were not separated till after lunch on the second day. At the same time, if a ball wanted hitting, he hit it. Many will remember how at Lord's in 1952 the match had barely been in progress half-an-hour when he hit Jenkins high over the screen at the Nursery End. He had a fine cover-drive and hit well to leg. Like many players of great natural ability he did not in attack worry overmuch about the straightness of his bat. In fact he was essentially a practical batsman who was prepared to go in cheerfully whenever his captain wanted and adapt his tactics to the state of the match."", 'As a bowler, he was a slow left-hander of the old-fashioned orthodox type, varying his natural legbreak with a faster one which came with his arm and got him lots of wickets. His figures in 1946 are the more creditable when one realises that for most of the tour he was suffering from an injury which made this ball tiring and difficult to bowl.

In his 22 Tests, spread over almost a decade, he went in anywhere between No. 1 and No 8. And quite often, he often played in only one Test of a series. This was a pity for Mankad possessed a wide range of strokes and even though he could never measure up to the level of his great father Vinoo Mankad, he did have the talent and class to run up better scores than his overall career figures suggest. He first came into prominence by scoring a half century as a teenager against the MCC for West Zone in 1963-64. A series of big scores over the years saw him get his break against New Zealand in 1969-70. He went in late in the order and then because of circumstances was pushed to the opening slot. He was an instant success in his new role against Australia, negotiating McKenzie and Connolly with ease and running up successive scores of 74, 8, 64, 68 and 97. He had a fair amount of success on the tour of West Indies in 1971, striking up a good combination with `new boy' Sunil Gavaskar with whom he shared partnerships of 68, 74, 72 and 123 (unbroken). But he failed in England in 1971 and thereafter a question mark hung over his Test career. Overlooked for the series against England in 1972-73, he played in only one Test against England in 1974 and again only in one Test against West Indies in 1974-75, always being shuttled up and down the order. He missed the dual tour of New Zealand and West Indies but was back for the series against New Zealand at home in 1976-77. He did well enough but was dropped and was again considered for only one Test against England later that season.

Having played in the first of his 55 Tests in  1951-52, against  England at  Calcutta, he soon showed his quality by making 133 in his first Test in  England (at  Headingley) in June, 1952, when only twenty. Coming in at 42 for 3 on the first morning, with  Trueman and  Bedser on the warpath (and  Laker to follow), he and his captain, Hazare, rescued  India's innings with a fourth-wicket partnership of 222, which still stands as a record between the two countries. If, as the years passed, problems of weight slowed him down, he had sufficiently nimble footwork and enough natural ability always to be a dangerous opponent and often a joy to watch. Like many of the best Indian batsmen, he was small and a fine cutter and hooker. Within nine months of his 133 at Headingley he scored 118 against West Indies at  Kingston, sharing on that occasion a record second-wicket partnership with  Pankaj Roy. His two best Test series were against  New Zealand in  India in  1955-56 (386 runs, average 77.20) and against  England in  India in  1961-62 (586 runs, average 83.71). He made seven Test centuries, the highest his 189 against England at  Delhi in  1961-62 and the last of them in his final Test innings, against  New Zealand at  Madras in February  1965. At  Bombay in  1964-65 his two innings of 59 and 39 were invaluable contributions towards  India's first Test victory over  Australia.

Wristy, willowy and sinuous, he can match - sometimes even better - Tendulkar for strokeplay. His on-side game is comparable to his idol Azharuddin's, yet he is decidedly more assured on the off side and has the rare gift of being able to hit the same ball to either side. The Australians, who have suffered more than most, paid the highest compliment after India's 2003-04 tour Down Under by admitting they did not know where to bowl to him. Laxman, a one-time medical student, finally showed signs of coming to terms with his considerable gifts in March 2001, as he tormented Steve Waugh's thought-to-be-invincible Australians with a majestic 281 to stand the Kolkata Test on its head. But even though he had another wonderful series against the Australians in 2003-04 with two centuries, one of them involving a back-from-the-dead, match-winning, 300-plus partnership with Kolkata ally Rahul Dravid at Adelaide, he hasn't quite managed the consistency that could have turned him into a batting great.  Between dazzling and sometimes workmanlike hundreds, he has suffered the frustration of numerous twenties and thirties and has lost his place in the one-day side. Nothing, though, has deterred him from tormenting his favourite opponents with silken strokes and piles of runs: in the course of the double-hundred at Feroz Shah Kotla in 2008, he became the second Indian batsman after Tendulkar to score more than 2000 runs against the Australians. A couple of years later, batting with a runner due to back spasms, he conjured up a magical unbeaten 73 in a thrilling run-chase in Mohali. \n"", 'However, in 2011 the runs dried up in two successive overseas trips - in eight innings in England he scored 182, and then the poor run continued in his favourite country and against his favourite opponent, Australia. With India losing those matches badly, his future as an international player was suddenly under threat.\n', ""There were calls from former players and commentators questioning Laxman's selection for the two-Test home series against New Zealand in August 2012.

But with all those gifts came a curse - his brittle body, which may well have contributed to him playing his last Test in 2004. Still T20 cricket, which has a cap of only four overs, gave Nehra a lifeline and at 36 he revived his international career because he had reprised the ability to move the ball at 140 kph, and became one of India\'s most successful bowlers in the 2016 World T20.\n \nNehra came out of his first full tour - to Zimbabwe in 2000-01 - with his reputation as one of the most promising new-ball bowlers on the international circuit vastly enhanced, and his performance in Bulawayo played a key role in India winning a Test outside the subcontinent for the first time in 15 years. He struggled to establish himself thereafter, as inconsistency and injuries saw him slip down the pace bowling list.\n \nThe high point of that difficult period came in the 2003 World Cup against England, where he scalped 6 for 23 and then threw up by the side of the pitch. Surgery on a troublesome ankle, and an indifferent tour of Australia followed, and Nehra\'s status as an automatic pick was lost. He pulled out midway through the 2005 Zimbabwe tour and had a succession of operations on his ankle that slowed down his career. He hit the headlines with creditable showings in the IPL, particularly in the second season, and was recalled to the ODI squad for the tour of West Indies in June 2009 and found his mojo again.\n \nHis 31 ODI wickets in 2009 were the most he had ever taken in a year, and he followed it up with 28 dismissals in 2010 to establish his place in India\'s 2011 World Cup squad. He bowled a match-winning spell against Pakistan in the semi-final, but his body failed him again - an on-field injury prevented him from playing the final, which India won to become world champions.\n \nIt was long thought that was the end of Nehra, but he willed himself back into contention picking up 22 wickets for Chennai Super Kings in 2015 - the most by an Indian fast bowler. ""I don\'t know what has happened. Whether it is my face, I don\'t know,"" he joked on being ignored by India\'s selectors in June.

Indeed, his approach came as a whiff of fresh air and, not unexpectedly, he was a great crowd puller. A swashbuckling opening batsman cast in the Mushtaq Ali mould, Srikkanth could destroy the strongest and most fearsome attacks in the world by fearless pulling, hooking and driving. But there were times when he could be dismissed by some pretty ordinary bowling. Gifted with a good eye and super-quick reflexes, Srikkanth's buccaneering methods quickly caught the eye of the selectors and he made his international debut at 21. Consistency however was not his watchword and he was more out of than in the Indian team. But by the mid 80s, his attacking methods had acquired some discipline and he remained the regular opening batsman till 1989. Appointed captain for the tour of Pakistan that year he achieved a major triumph when the team drew all the four Tests. But the selectors pounced on his batting failures and he only made it back after two years in the wilderness. By this time he was over 30 and he did not have the reflexes of old. And when he was not selected for the South Zone team in 1993, Srikkanth, at 33, announced his retirement. If his Test record is impressive, given his sometimes outrageous batting style, he was a natural for the limited-overs game.

He was 57, and suffered from diabetes. Statistically, Solkar remains Test cricket\'s most successful fielder, with 53 catches in just 27 matches - of those who played at least ten, the nextbest is Bob Simpson\'s 110 in 62 Tests, or 1.77 per match to Solkar\'s 1.96. The top catchers are usually firmly camped in the slip cordon, but most of Solkar\'s came at forward short leg, where he lurked uncomfortably up close and personal to the batsman. Bishan Bedi, one of the great Indian spinners of the time whose menace was greatly enhanced by this, confirmed: ""His close-in catching was really intimidating. We would not have been the same bowlers without him."" Tony Greig, an opponent in the 1972-73 series in India, said: ""Ekki was the best forward short leg I have ever seen."" His catching was often preceded by some very idiosyncratic sledging. ""I\'ll get you, bloody,"" he advised Geoff Boycott, and he told Garry Sobers to mind his own business. Solkar rose from humble roots. His father was the groundsman at the Hindu Gymkhana in Bombay, and he grew up in a oneroom hut on the ground shared with his parents and five siblings (one of whom, Anant, also played first-class cricket). He impressed the Bombay players with his bowling in the nets, and turned himself into a handy all-rounder, allying adhesive batting to his enthusiastic left-arm seamers - for Indian Schools, who he captained despite his lowly birth; for Bombay, taking six for 38 on his Ranji Trophy debut in 1966-67; for Sussex in one match in 1969; and then for India. Some affectionately called him ""the poor man\'s Sobers"", but he outdid even him in India\'s victory in the West Indies in 1970-71, with six catches and a crucial 55 in the only definite result, India\'s win at Port-of-Spain. Later in 1971, he played an equally vital role in India\'s first Test and series victory in England, with 44 and three wickets in a famous triumph at The Oval. There were also three catches, one - in England\'s second-innings collapse to dispose of Alan Knott, who had made 90 first time around - as fine as any, when Solkar was stationed even closer than usual.', 'In the 1970s, when Indian cricket was hovering near the top of the world, the image of Eknath Solkar diving for a catch was as firmly embedded in the collective consciousness of a nation as Sunil Gavaskar\'s straight drive or the skills of India\'s spin quartet. ""We would never have been as effective without Solkar at short leg,"" Bishan Bedi once said.', ""Eknath Dhondu Solkar, who died of a heart attack aged 57, was sometimes called the `poor man's Garry Sobers' because he could bat anywhere, and bowl both medium-pace and spin. As a fielder, however, he held his own. When India beat West Indies for the first time ever, at Port of Spain in 1970-71, Solkar equalled the then world record of six catches in a Test."", ""His 53 catches came at almost two a match, the best ratio among fielders with over 50 catches. He toured the Caribbean and New Zealand in 1975-76 on the strength of his fielding alone, for by then Solkar the bowler had virtually ceased to exist, and as a batsman he was no longer `Mr Dependable'. "", 'So assured were Solkar\'s hands - he made catches where other fielders might  have seen barely a half chance - that, like a Bradman zero, a Solkar miss made the headlines when he was in his prime. His best catch was the running, tumbling effort that ended Clive Lloyd\'s fiery 163 in a Bangalore Test. ""The ball was dipping away from me,"" he explained.', ""In the 1972-73 home series against England, he caught 12 batsmen in the first three Tests and needed only three more to equal Syd Gregory's long-standing world record. He dropped Graham Roope in the fourth Test, and didn't get another chance. While Lloyd made 242 in the Mumbai Test two years later, he dropped him early. Towards the end the stress of fielding in the `suicide position' unprotected (no helmet or shin guards) began to tell on him."", ""The stress in the early days, when he shared a single room with his parents and five siblings, was of a different nature. Solkar's father was a groundsman at the P J Hindu Gymkhana in Bombay. The legendary allrounder Vinoo Mankad first encouraged him to play a more organised game. He was a left-arm spinner and a batsman good enough to lead Indian Schoolboys. Four years later, he made his Test debut against New Zealand. "", ""The `Mr Dependable' tag was earned early. In the first Test of that successful 1970-71 West Indies series, India were 75 for 5 before Solkar's 61 helped Dilip Sardesai add 137. Three Tests later India were 70 for 6 when the same pair put on 186. In the next series, Solkar's 67 helped India win at Lord's. "", 'Solkar was 28 when he played the last of his 27 Tests, ending up with 1,068 runs at 25.42. Better counselling may have extended his career, and better planning might have seen him concentrate on batting alone. But 30 years ago cricket teams did not travel with psychologists and other assorted gurus, and a talented player was allowed to wither away.']",[],27.0,48,6,1068.0,102,25.42,,,1,6,,3,53.0,0.0,7.0,6,0,27.0,13,4.5,79,34.17,0,0,2,0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,189.0,270,36,6851,145*,29.27,,,8,36,,,190.0,0.0,21.0,15,1,125,65,8.92,,,0,1,,,5.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27.0,44,2265,1070,18.0,3/28,3/38,59.44,2.83,125.8,0,0,0,7.0,6,252,169,4.0,2/31,2/31,42.25,4.02,63.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,189.0,,21725,8282,276,6/38,,30.00,2.28,78.7,,10,1,21.0,,809,554,19,3/31,3/31,29.15,4.10,42.5,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He bowled 34 overs, picked no wickets, and after that summer, did not play for India again. At the time, he had played 14 Tests, 58 ODIs and 10 T20Is.', ' \nWhen RP Singh was in top form though, his run-up was smooth, pace nippy, and he had an inswinger that confounded right-handed batsmen. He took 34 wickets in six Ranji Trophy games for Uttar Pradesh in 2003-04, the joint third-highest for the season. He made the national one-day squad at the end of 2005, and took two wickets in his second over of international cricket, against Zimbabwe in Harare in September. He claimed four wickets, and the Man-of-the-Match award, against Sri Lanka in his third game, and three more in his fourth, before a run of four wicketless matches cost him his place in 2006.', "" \nHe was Man of the Match on his Test debut for some persistent bowling on a shirtfront in Faisalabad in 2006, where Pakistan ran up 588. He drifted out of contention after that, returned for his most prolific season in 2007-08, but began fading away soon after. The IPL gave him another stage to show his wares and his 23 wickets in the 2009 season, when the tournament was played in South Africa, led Deccan Chargers to the title. He has not been part of the tournament since 2013, but was still among the top-15 wicket-takers in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2015-16. Limited-overs cricket still seems to suit him best. At the age of 30, he was one of the leaders in Gujarat's title-winning campaign in the Vijay Hazare tournament in the 2015-16 season.

"", ""He pressed a claim for higher things through two centuries in the 2008-09 Ranji final, a feat last achieved by Sachin Tendulkar and only four others before him. However, his lack of consistency meant he wasn't a part of India's World Cup-winning squad, and returned to national duty only when the top players were rested on the tour to the West Indies in 2011. There, he made his presence felt with consistent scores in the ODIs and the Man-of-the-Series award. But his form continued to fluctuate in the months that followed, and he remained one of India's most promising but unfulfilled talents over the next couple of years. All that changed in 2013, and with Tendulkar retiring from Tests and ODIs that year, Rohit looked set to be a permanent fixture in the Indian team across formats."", ""Then came the 2015 World Cup and Rohit ended up as India's second-highest run-scorer, with an impressive 137 against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals, further cementing his place in the top order.

His good looks (he was a pop singer and a film actor), aggressive batsmanship and a penchant for big hits made Patil a natural crowd puller. An instant success after making his Test debut and on his first tour, he took 174 off Dennis Lillee and Len Pascoe at Adelaide. It was a remarkable innings given that in the previous Test he was concussed by a bouncer from Pascoe after scoring 65.  After a moderate series against England in 1981-82 he was dropped but was back for the tour of there in 1982. And at Old Trafford he came up with another memorable display, hitting an undefeated 129, in the process taking 24 runs (4440444) off an over from Bob Willis - the third delivery being a no ball. He did reasonably well on the tour of Pakistan in 1982-83 but because of personal problems he dropped out of the team to tour West Indies in 1983.  Back for the World Cup in 1983, Patil was one of the heroes of that triumph. But in the Tests against Pakistan and West Indies in 1983-84, his aggressive batting was laced with a bit of indiscipline and he could not maintain his place in the side.  And though he did reasonably well against England the following season, he was dropped after two games and was never considered for Tests again, though he was picked for the tour of England in 1986 when he played only in the one-day games. \n', ""A stalwart for Bombay for several years, Patil in the last few seasons of his first-class career captained Madhya Pradesh with much success. After retirement, Patil served first as India A coach, then coach of the Indian team, before moving on to take charge of Kenya. He resigned after taking them to the semi-final of the 2003 World Cup, and returned to India for the next 18 months, but an uncertain future with India A meant that he went back to a minnow, Oman this time, in the Intercontinental Cup and helped them qualify for the ICC Trophy after some strong performances in the ACC Trophy. Patil went on to serve as the coach of the Mumbai Champs in the ICL, but returned to the mainstream when he cut ties with the unofficial league in 2009.

Standing at 6\'4"", his rhythmic, high-arm action allowed him to bowl at around 140 kph. For one who started serious cricket at 14, his rise was rapid and he made his Ranji Trophy debut at 18. An injury to Munaf Patel provided him an opening during India\'s tour of Bangladesh in May 2007 but it was in Australia where he caught the attention, prompting Steve Waugh to call him the next best thing in Indian cricket. He showed he could move the ball both ways and his probing spell in the second innings in Perth, where he set-up Ricky Ponting, is the stuff of folklore. He continued to impress in the one-day series, clocking more than 150kph once, and ended as India\'s highest wicket-taker in the triumphant campaign.  \n', ""The glory days continued through his debut season, with a notable performance against South Africa, followed by 15 wickets in four Tests in the succesful home series against Australia in 2008, and a couple of strong shows in Sri Lanka in ODIs. By now Ishant was clearly Zaheer Khan's deputy in the Indian seam arsenal, but things have gone seriously wrong since. Some have blamed it on his being over-bowled, particularly on flat tracks in the IPL, while others point to a malaise that has afflicted all of India's new crop of fast bowlers. The fact remains that Ishant lost the most crucial aspect of his bowling - his pace. Without it, his natural short-of-a-good-length that had tormented batsmen of Ponting's calibre a season earlier lost its venom. Eventually the loss of pace led to a loss of self-confidence. The Indian selectors decided to be careful and began shielding him from the shorter formats of the game in 2009 in the hope that he would rediscover his zip. His struggle continued but given India's limited seam-bowling resources at the time, Ishant was persisted with, even after an ankle surgery in 2012 that put him out of action for months. When he completed 50 Tests in early 2013 he had among the worst averages for bowlers with 50 Test caps to their name."", ""Since then Ishant has somewhat revived his Test career. He was impressive on the tour of New Zealand, being the top wicket-taker in Tests with 15 wickets that included two five-wicket hauls. On his next overseas assignment, in England, Ishant was the hero of India's famous win at Lord's when he bounced out the England batsmen with his spell of 7 for 74, helping India to a 1-0 lead in the Test series. It was perhaps one of his best performances for India in whites.  "", 'He soon suffered a leg injury and was ruled out for the following two Tests. He did return for the fifth Test but his 4 for 96 was only part of an embarrassing innings defeat for India. He then went back to Australia, the country that had kick-started his career, but he could only manage mediocre performances in the three Tests he was a part of. His landing foot was proving to be a constant irritant to his fitness and the fast bowler picked up another injury, this time to his knee and was ruled out of the ODI tri-series that followed. Ishant failed to recover in time for the World Cup and was replaced by Mohit Sharma.']",[],90.0,124,43,627.0,31*,7.74,2211,28.35,0,0,71,0,19.0,0.0,80.0,28,13,72.0,13,4.8,203,35.46,0,0,6,0,19.0,0.0,14.0,3,2,8.0,5*,8.00,9,88.88,0,0,1,0,4.0,0.0,132.0,168,62,889,66,8.38,2954,30.09,0,1,100,3,29.0,0.0,123.0,45,20,174,31,6.96,368,47.28,0,0,12,1,26.0,0.0,120.0,30,22,55,9,6.87,75,73.33,0,0,4,1,28.0,0.0,90.0,161,17196,9155,267.0,7/74,10/108,34.28,3.19,64.4,9,8,1,80.0,78,3733,3563,115.0,4/34,4/34,30.98,5.72,32.4,6,0,0,14.0,14,278,400,8.0,2/34,2/34,50.00,8.63,34.7,0,0,0,132.0,234,24571,12557,426,7/24,11/51,29.47,3.06,57.6,18,13,2,123.0,120,5834,5154,178,5/21,5/21,28.95,5.30,32.7,10,1,0,120.0,120,2575,3356,93,5/12,5/12,36.08,7.81,27.6,1,1,0,False,False,False,False

Within a couple of years in international cricket, he was thought of as a possible successor to Kapil in the all-round department. There was talent to back the hype: cast your mind back to January 2006, when the lethal curve of his late swing consumed, off the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of the Karachi Test, Salman Butt, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf; or to the previous Test in Faisalabad, where his 210-run partnership with MS Dhoni steered India past the follow-on mark. \n', ' \nBut a number of factors, not least the constant injuries that Kapil miraculously avoided, meant Irfan never really fulfilled his potential, and by his late 20s was more or less confined to bits-and-pieces roles in various IPL teams.', "" \nIrfan was 19 when he made his Test debut in Australia, but already looked the part, bowling at a brisk pace and troubling quality batsmen with his left-arm swing. He played a big part in India's one-day and Test series wins on their revival tour of Pakistan in 2004."", ' \nHis batting soon took off and, under the management team of Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell, he was regularly pushed up the order in ODIs - with a promotion to No.3 immediately yielding a spectacular 83 against Sri Lanka in Nagpur. He was more than just a clean ball-striker, though, and his sensible, straight-bat approach often bailed India out of strife in Tests as well.', "" \nBut, either side of that Karachi hat-trick, his bowling form nosedived, with his pace dropping significantly, and he struggled to make both the Test and ODI teams by the time 2006 had ended. He was sent back from the tour of South Africa in 2006 to focus on domestic cricket. He made the 2007 World Cup squad but didn't figure in a single game during India's disappointing campaign, and was thereafter dropped from both the Test and ODI sides."", ' \nRecalled for the inaugural World T20 in September 2007, Pathan did not disappoint, snapping up 10 wickets at 14.90. His crucial spell of 3 for 16 in the final against Pakistan earned him the Man-of-the-Match award.', "" \nIrfan returned to the ODI side for the home series against Australia and Pakistan, and showed he had rediscovered his rhythm, based on which he was handed a recall in the third Test against Pakistan in Bangalore. He celebrated his comeback by making his first Test hundred. He was subsequently picked for the Test series in Australia, and came into the side for the third Test in Perth, where he played a crucial part in India's famous win - with five wickets and scores of 28 and 46 to claim the Man-of-the-Match award."", "" \nIrfan lost his place in the India squad in 2009 and subsequently struggled with loss of form and injuries. A back injury forced him to spend eight months on the sidelines after the 2010 IPL, and he missed the entire domestic season. That did not stop him from being bought for $1.9 million by Delhi Daredevils at the 2011 IPL auction in January. After a mixed IPL season, he impressed during the 2011-12 Ranji Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker after four rounds of the tournament. His performances earned him a recall to the national side when he was picked for the final two ODIs against the West Indies in December, 2011. He came into his own during the one-day series in Sri Lanka in 2012, finishing as the highest wicket-taker and most economical bowler. He played the 2012 World T20 - also in Sri Lanka - and played all of India's games in the tournament, before injury struck once more."", ' \nIrfan has played no international cricket since then, but remains, like his brother Yusuf, a sought-after name at the IPL. He has had stints at Kings XI Punjab, Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad, as well as an injury-ravaged 2015 season where he did not play a single game for Chennai Super Kings.

Initially, Parthiv's glovework varied from competent to shoddy, but it was his ability with the bat that got him an extended run with the national side. But, his increasingly sloppy work behind the stumps saw him lose his place in 2004, and with the emergence of Dinesh Karthik and then MS Dhoni, Parthiv went further down in the pecking order. \n"", ""Parthiv made sporadic comebacks but with Dhoni firmly entrenched in the limited-overs sides, he had to compete for the second keeper's slot with Wriddhiman Saha - who became the first-choice wicket-keeper in Tests following Dhoni's retirement - Naman Ojha and Karthik. Parthiv tweaked his training methods - he split his day into two exclusive sessions of batting and keeping - to ensure optimum fitness and performance levels, and it began to pay off. "", ""In IPL 2015, Parthiv, after a lukewarm beginning, struck form in the latter half of the tournament and tallied 339 runs to finish as the fourth-leading batsman in Mumbai Indians' victorious campaign.

Kiran More had seen him bowl in the nets and sent him straight to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai to train under TA Sekhar and Dennis Lillee. Soon he was being hailed as the fastest man in Indian cricket. Then, even as Baroda and Gujarat vied for his services, Munaf chose Mumbai, after Sachin Tendulkar had taken special interest in him and had a word with the authorities in the Mumbai Cricket Association. Even then Munaf's first-class career was anything but smooth as he spent more time recovering from various injuries than actually playing. \n"", ""Strongly built though not overly tall, Munaf gradually gathers momentum in his approach to the crease, before releasing the ball with a windmill-whirl of the hands. His priority, in his early years, was to bowl quick. And it was this that first caught the eye of More and others. Later, he added reverse swing to his repertoire and troubled batsmen with a well-directed yorker. After plenty of speculation and close calls he finally received a call from the national selection panel for the second Test against England in March 2006, after an impressive performance for the Board President's XI saw him pick up 10 English wickets for 91 runs. In Mohali a week later, he ended with 7 for 97, the best performance by an Indian fast bowler on Test debut. A consistent series against West Indies later that year meant Munaf had established himself as a regular member of the side. "", ""Then came the lull as Munaf, like most of India's new crop of fast bowlers, began to fade away after a good start. He lost pace at an alarming rate, and seemed intent on rebranding himself as back-up seamer as opposed to a pace spearhead.

Bowlers must always fancy their chances against a batsman who plays so many strokes; it's just that Sehwag fancies his chances against them much more. \n"", 'As a starry-eyed youngster from Najafgarh, where his family ran a flour mill, Sehwag grew up, like many others from his generation, wanting to be Sachin Tendulkar. Indeed, when he scored his first one-day hundred, filling up for his injured idol against New Zealand in Sri Lanka, he could have been mistaken for him: there was the same back-foot punch on the off side, the minimalistic straight drive and the wristy whip to the leg. And on his Test debut, on a fiery pitch in Bloemfontein, he matched the master stroke for stroke as they both blazed away to hundreds. But soon he emerged his own man, and not long after Tendulkar was playing a supporting, and somewhat calming, hand as Sehwag romped away to a triple-hundred, the first by an Indian, in Multan, bringing it up with a six. Two Tests ago, he had been dismissed trying the same stroke five short of what would have been his first Test double-hundred.', ""His uncomplicated approach - batting is all about scoring as many runs as quickly as possible - belies a sharp and street-smart cricket mind. He has a keen grasp of his own, and his opponents', strengths and weaknesses and exploits them in a forensic manner. What appears risky to many, is merely an opportunity for him, and his lack of footwork, which does get him in trouble against the moving ball, is mostly an advantage, for it creates space for his brilliant handwork. Few batsmen have hit the ball harder square on the off side, and fewer still have hit them as frequently. And the sight of a spinner brings the savage out in him: and for many spectacular assaults against the world's leading spinners, there have numerous outrageous dismissals against the not-so-reputed ones."", ""The most remarkable aspect of Sehwag's career of course has been his ability to build massive scores at breathtaking speed. He holds the Indian record for highest number of Test double-hundreds, and came within seven runs of becoming the first batsman to score three triple-hundreds. That innings, against Sri Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, epitomised the Sehwag brand of batsmanship: a mix of imagination, daring, power, skills, and clarity of vision. His ODI career doesn't have as many high points, and yet he held the record for the highest score in that format at one point, scoring an astonishing 219 against West Indies in Indore. The most remarkable feature of the innings was the ease with which he reached the landmark, completing his double-hundred with more than six overs to spare.

Sardesai enjoyed playing against England: he made his Test debut against them in 1961-62, even before he'd played for Bombay, and it was against England, at Kanpur two years later, that he scored 79 and, after India followed on, 87 to help save the game.

","[""\nSachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke - the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it's because he was equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox shots (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and can pull them out at will.  \n"", ""There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could score all around the wicket, off both front foot and back, could tune his technique to suit every condition, temper his game to suit every situation, and made runs in all parts of the world in all conditions."", 'Some of his finest performances came against Australia, the overwhelmingly dominant team of his era. His century as a 19-year-old on a lightning-fast pitch at the WACA is considered one of the best innings ever to have been played in Australia. A few years later he received the ultimate compliment from the ultimate batsman: Don Bradman confided to his wife that Tendulkar reminded him of himself.', 'Blessed with the keenest of cricket minds, and armed with a loathing for losing, Tendulkar set about doing what it took to become one of the best batsmen in the world. His greatness was established early: he was only 16 when he made his Test debut. He was hit on the mouth by Waqar Younis but continued to bat, in a blood-soaked shirt. His first Test hundred, a match-saving one at Old Trafford, came when he was 17, and he had 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25. In 2000 he became the first batsman to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian Lara as the leading Test run-scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs 30,000 international runs, and 50 Test hundreds.', ""He currently holds the record for most hundreds in both Tests and ODIs - remarkable, considering he didn't score his first ODI hundred till his 79th match. Incredibly, he retained a divine enthusiasm for the game till his last match. At 36 years and 306 days he broke a 40-year-old barrier by scoring the first double-century in one-day cricket. In 2012, when just one month short of his 39th birthday, he became the first player to score 100 international centuries, which like Bradman's batting average, could be a mark that lasts for ever. Later that year, though, he announced his retirement from ODIs after a disappointing 18 months in international cricket. And on November 16, 2013, Tendulkar retired from Test cricket after a memorable 200th Test, on his home ground at the Wankhede Stadium against West Indies. "", ""Tendulkar's considerable achievements seem greater still when looked at in the light of the burden of expectations he had to bear from his adoring but somewhat unreasonable followers, who have been prone to regard anything less than a hundred in each innings as a failure. The aura may have dimmed, if only slightly, as the years on the international circuit took their toll on the body, but Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world.\n"", ' ']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1997', ""LG People's Choice Award 2010"", 'ICC Player of the Year 2010']",200.0,329,33,15921.0,248*,53.78,,,51,68,,69,115.0,0.0,463.0,452,41,18426.0,200*,44.83,21367,86.23,49,96,2016,195,140.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,10.0,10,10.00,12,83.33,0,0,2,0,1.0,0.0,310.0,490,51,25396,248*,57.84,,,81,116,,,186.0,0.0,551.0,538,55,21999,200*,45.54,,,60,114,,,175.0,0.0,96.0,96,11,2797,100*,32.90,2310,121.08,1,16,359,38,28.0,0.0,200.0,145,4240,2492,46.0,3/10,3/14,54.17,3.52,92.1,0,0,0,463.0,270,8054,6850,154.0,5/32,5/32,44.48,5.10,52.2,4,2,0,1.0,1,15,12,1.0,1/12,1/12,12.00,4.8,15.0,0,0,0,310.0,,7605,4384,71,3/10,,61.74,3.45,107.1,,0,0,551.0,,10230,8478,201,5/32,5/32,42.17,4.97,50.8,4,2,0,96.0,8,93,123,2,1/12,1/12,61.50,7.93,46.5,0,0,0,False,True,False,True

His bowling - the reason he was first noticed - is characterised by a galloping approach, accuracy, and reverse-swing. But it is his batting that is more likely to win matches. He boasts a prodigious array of strokes and is particularly strong driving through cover and mid-off off both front and back foot. \nHe has two gears: block or blast. Cut off the big shots and Razzaq gets bogged down, although patience is his virtue as he demonstrated in a match-saving fifty against India in Mohali in 2005. Just prior to that he had also played a bewilderingly slow innings in Australia, scoring four runs in over two hours. When the occasion demands it though, as ODIs often do, he can still slog with the best of them: England were pillaged for a 22-ball 51 at the end of 2005. and then again for nearly 60 runs in the last three overs of an ODI in September the following year. \n', ""It has hardly been smooth sailing though through his career. He suffered a slump, particularly in his bowling, between 2002 and 2004 when, though his place in the team wasn't under threat, there was uncertainty over how best to use him. But there were signs he was rediscovering some of his old guile if not his pace and nip. And if the pitch is in anyway helpful to seam - as it was in his first and only Test five-wicket haul at Karachi in 2004 or against India at the same venue in January 2006 - he can be a proper danger. Though Kamran Akmal's hundred overshadowed all in the Karachi win over India, Razzaq's performance was easily his most emphatic as an allrounder: he scored 45 and 90 as well as taking seven wickets in the match. A combination of injuries and poor form put his Test place into question and a knee injury days before the 2007 World Cup meant Pakistan missed his presence in a disastrous campaign. "", 'A lackluster comeback to international cricket against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi and mediocre performance in the practice matches saw Razzaq being omitted from the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 World Championship and consequently announce his retirement from international cricket. He then went on to sign for Worcestershire towards the end of the county season as well as signing up with the Indian Cricket League, which ruled him out of Pakistan contention. He took back his decision to retire but committed himself to the ICL for two seasons, during which he served the Hyderabad Heroes as one of their star players. ', ""After a global amnesty and quitting the ICL, he was welcomed back to the Pakistan fold for the World Twenty20 in England and made an immediate impact as Pakistan won the tournament. His Test comeback also looked set to be complete after he was included in Pakistan's 15-man squad for the tour of Sri Lanka in June.

He did it with style, too. Blessed with a fast bowler's temperament and fire, he surrounded his craft with mystique. Before the 1982 tour to England, captain Imran Khan asked him to grow a French beard to enhance the aura and it worked: England were his favourite victims through his career, responsible for his international breakthrough in 1977-78 as well as his finest hours, at the Oval in 1987 and the home series later that year (he took 30 wickets in three Tests, including the best bowling in an innings by a Pakistani, 9 for 56 in Lahore). Imran was to be a key influence on his career, one of the few capable of getting the best out of Qadir the man and bowler. \n"", ""Qadir's action was a wonderfully extravagant routine, and he admitted more than once that it was contrived as a spectacle to distract batsmen. Variety was the key; it was said he had six different deliveries per over. Like the Andy Roberts bouncer, Qadir was said to have two different googlies. The flipper was often equally lethal though much often depended not on his ability but on mood. "", ""Rarely was the mood right against India, whose batsmen were largely untroubled by him. On Pakistan's historic 1987 tour, when they won a series in India for the first time, Qadir was largely ineffective for four Tests before being dropped for the final. Iqbal Qasim and Tauseef Ahmed, orthodox spinners both, were far more effective and led Pakistan to victory. But for every India, there was a West Indies and that Pakistan were able to compete with the era's most frighteningly dominant team without losing a series to them in the mid-80s was largely down to Qadir's successes against them."", ""Qadir's appetite for the fight could not be questioned and it often came out in his batting. He played a few combative Test innings and some vital ODI ones, once taking 16 off Courtney Walsh's last over to win a World Cup tie. He faded away from the scene, however, in the early 90s with the emergence of Mushtaq Ahmed and played his last ODI in 1993. Since then he has run a private academy near Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore and his four sons have followed him into the game, with varying degrees of success, but his role in Mushtaq's rise and, to a lesser extent, that of Danish Kaneria should not be overlooked. In November 2008 Qadir was given licence to contribute more directly once again to Pakistan cricket when he was appointed the chief selector, but he resigned after a little over six months in the job.

Wadekar made his first-class debut in 1958-59 but had to wait eight years before playing for India in 1966-67, despite a string of big scores around the domestic circuit. But he took little time to establish himself in the Indian team and was a tower of strength to the Indian batting for seven years, playing scintillating or valuable knocks depending upon the state of the game. He was one of the best No. 3 batsmen in the history of Indian cricket and one of the finest slip fielders. \n"", ""Vijay Merchant's casting vote as chairman of the selection committee ended MAK Pataudi's long reign as Indian captain and handed over the leadership to Wadekar in January 1971. He proved himself to be a capable captain, if not a shrewd tactician, and a combination of circumstances, and a fair share of good fortune,  led to India beating West Indies and then England. A third successive series triumph over England, this time at home, followed in 1972-73 and Wadekar was at his peak as batsman and captain when he led India to England in 1974. What followed was anti climax. All three Tests were lost by margins that brooked no argument in what went down as the inglorious `Summer of 42'.

When all is not well, he looks so awkward you forget he can hit the ball clean and long. All has been well with Yuvraj more often in limited-overs cricket, where he can be effortless and brutal at the same time, than in Tests, though his form and consistency has been on the decline since his comeback following a recovery from a rare form of germ cell cancer in 2012. When he started off, though, his athleticism on the field and his canny left-arm spin made him a key one-day player as Indian cricket went through a makeover at the turn of the century. \n', 'Yuvraj\'s father, Yograj, who played one Test for India, was what Mike Agassi was to Andre. So obsessed was he with Yuvraj\'s cricket that he took a skating gold medal off his young son\'s neck and threw it out of the car. ""From now on, you are going to play cricket."" And from then on he has played cricket. The major shift came when, at 15, he carried kitbags in crowded local trains, living away from his parents and a luxurious life in Punjab. At 18 he was shredding a strong Australian attack, in only his second ODI, in the Champions Trophy in 2000.', ""Soon Yuvraj would become India's middle-order lynchpin, forming fruitful partnerships first with Rahul Dravid and then with MS Dhoni. Both batsmen, superb ODI operators in their own right, credited their success to Yuvraj's ability to score at will. Testament to Yuvraj's importance is that when he was dropped from the ODI side in 2010, it was the first such occurrence since he cemented his place in the Indian team. His ODI career is full of highlight reels, with the biggest impact being his contribution to India's World Cup triumph in 2011 - 362 runs, 15 wickets, and four Man-of-the-Match awards, and the Player of the Tournament. That put to shade even his awesome achievement in the World T20 triumph in 2007, where he famously hit a Stuart Broad over for six sixes."", ""However, his limitations have manifested themselves in Tests, where he has struggled both against the seaming and swinging ball, and quality spin. Apart from three shining innings - a sparkling century on a Lahore greentop, another from 61 for 4 against Pakistan, and an unbeaten 85 in a successful chase of 387 in Chennai - his Test career doesn't have much to write home about."", ""The World Cup win in 2011 was the biggest moment of his cricket career, but soon after that came the biggest challenge of his life, when he was diagnosed cancer which required a two-and-a-half month treatment in the USA. He returned home after completing his chemotherapy in April 2012, fairly confident that he could resume his duties on the cricket field reasonably quickly and in August he was named in India's squad for the World T20 in Sri Lanka."", 'In January 2013, poor form and fitness led to his ouster from the team. But a visibly slimmer and fitter Yuvraj emerged from a training stint in France in October and hit an unbeaten 35-ball 77 in a T20I against Australia on his comeback. But lack of consistency meant he was out of the ODI mix after the tour of South Africa in December 2013.', ""Even as his form dipped, Yuvraj continued to be a hot pick at the IPL auction, picking up contracts worth over a million dollars in 2014 ($2.33 million or Rs 14 crore to RCB), 2015 ($2.67 million or Rs 16 crore to Delhi Daredevils) and 2016 ($1.04 million or Rs 7 crore to Sunrisers Hyderabad). The hype surrounding him didn't transcend onto the cricket field, however, and the low point was a laboured 21-ball 11 in the final of the 2014 World T20 which resulted in India losing momentum and eventually the title to Sri Lanka. "", ""In January 2016, he made yet another international return, in Australia, for the T20 stretch leading into the World T20, where a twisted ankle curtailed his tournament.

While he made waves in the domestic scene, Umesh really caught the eye during IPL 2010, where he impressed a much wider audience with his pace for Delhi Daredevils. He finally broke into the big league, when he was flown to the West Indies as a replacement for the injured Praveen Kumar during the World Twenty20 tournament in May 2010, and earned his first call-up to the India Test team for the tour of South Africa in November the same year. He made the Test playing XI for the first time against West Indies in Delhi in November 2011, and picked up nine wickets in his first two Tests, which in turn earned him a place for the Australia tour. ', 'On that tour, a disastrous one for India, Umesh was one of few positives for the side, outbowling his more experienced team-mates to finish with 14 wickets from four Tests and a strike rate of 50.50. More than his figures though, it was his speed and aggression that stood out. However, 2012 was an injury-prone year for him: he picked up a shin injury in Australia, before being ruled out one Test into the England series at the end of the year with back trouble. He returned to international cricket in June 2013 at the Champions Trophy in England, and a fast-bowler starved India would have heaved a collective sigh of relief to notice he had not lost his ability to bowl quick.', ""After continuing in the ODI circuit, both home and abroad, Umesh was picked for the Australia Tests in 2014 and he followed that up by becoming one of India's frontline bowlers at the 2015 World Cup, finishing as the third-highest wicket-taker with 18 wickets at an average of 17.83.""]",[],41.0,47,21,283.0,30,10.88,643,44.01,0,0,31,9,14.0,0.0,75.0,24,14,79.0,18*,7.9,134,58.95,0,0,8,1,22.0,0.0,7.0,1,0,2.0,2,2.00,4,50.0,0,0,0,0,3.0,0.0,81.0,96,42,808,128*,14.96,1269,63.67,1,1,86,31,30.0,0.0,118.0,52,25,284,30,10.51,297,95.62,0,0,24,15,32.0,0.0,136.0,42,22,170,26,8.50,150,113.33,0,0,13,10,34.0,0.0,41.0,80,6659,3983,119.0,6/88,10/133,33.47,3.58,55.9,5,2,1,75.0,73,3558,3565,106.0,4/31,4/31,33.63,6.01,33.5,4,0,0,7.0,7,150,219,9.0,2/19,2/19,24.33,8.76,16.6,0,0,0,81.0,148,13945,7765,264,7/48,12/79,29.41,3.34,52.8,11,13,2,118.0,116,5682,5451,164,5/26,5/26,33.23,5.75,34.6,4,1,0,136.0,134,2817,3837,140,5/18,5/18,27.40,8.17,20.1,2,1,0,False,False,False,False

Above all he had perseverance, and right or wrong, had served often as shock and stock bowler. ', ""But something was missing - the unknown quantity that makes great leggies great. It was not so much in Kaneria's tools but in his persona, and a peculiar lack of guile, especially if he was to be compared to countrymen such as Abdul Qadir and Mushtaq Ahmed, both of whom had wonderful presence. In turn, Kaneria also lacked a good captain, or always good supporting bowlers at the other end. Latterly he suffered the lack of even an able wicketkeeper.

Tall and handsome, with a Comptonesque mop of hair that led him to feature in advertisements as Pakistan\'s own Brylcreem Boy, Fazal\'s ability to cut and seam the ball at a fair pace led him to be compared - in style and stamina - to England\'s Alec Bedser. He was especially difficult to handle on the artificial pitches widely used in Pakistan in the 1950s: Neil Harvey, the great Australian batsman of the time, said that Fazal ""could make the ball talk"" on matting. When Pakistan beat India by an innings on the mat at Lucknow in October 1952 - only their second official Test - Fazal took 12 wickets, seven for 42 in the second innings. Then, on the inaugural tour of England in 1954, he again took 12 wickets as Pakistan pulled off a stunning series-levelling win at The Oval. England were 109 for two, chasing only 168, but lost their last eight wickets for 34. He took 13 for 114 at Karachi when Pakistan won their maiden Test against Australia, ""varying his swing with a mixture of leg-cutters and breakbacks"", according to Wisden. Overwork dulled his edge after that: he bowled 250 overs in the first three Tests of the 1957-58 series in West Indies. Fazal still managed eight wickets in the final Test, which Pakistan won. And the following season he became the first Pakistani to reach 100 Test wickets, in only his 22nd match, and added 12 more as they won the next game, against West Indies at Dacca. By then, he was Pakistan\'s captain, and led them in ten Tests in all. He retired after the 1962 England tour with a first-class bowling average of under 19. Hanif Mohammad, Pakistan\'s first star with the bat, recalled: ""He was a great human being, always willing to help anyone who sought his advice. All our wins since we started playing Test cricket were indebted to him."" Fazal might have played for India: the senior Nawab of Pataudi wanted him in his side for the 1946 tour of England, but the other selectors thought he was too young; he was selected for the 1947-48 tour of Australia, but then came Partition, and he chose Pakistan. He was instrumental in getting the new country Test status: his six for 40 in an unofficial Test against the 1951-52 MCC tourists helped convince Lord\'s of Pakistan\'s suitability. He had a long career in the police force, running the sports department where he groomed several top-class hockey players, and was still working, as director of a textile firm, when he had a heart attack in his office.']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1955'],34.0,50,6,620.0,60,14.09,,,0,1,,2,11.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,112.0,147,33,2662,100*,23.35,,,1,13,,,39.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34.0,53,9834,3434,139.0,7/42,13/114,24.7,2.09,70.7,6,13,4,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,112.0,,25932,8837,466,9/43,,18.96,2.04,55.6,,38,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Power was no surprise, but sublime touch was remarkable for a man of his bulk. He loathed exercise and often looked a passenger in the field, but with a willow between his palms he was suddenly galvanised. He played shots all round the wicket, was especially strong off his legs, and unleashed ferocious pulls and lofted drives. Imran Khan rated him the best batsman in the world against pace.  \n', ""\nEarly on he was vulnerable playing across his front pad or groping outside off stump. He used his feet well to the spinners, although this aggression has been his undoing. Inzi kept a cool head in a crisis and succeeded Javed Miandad as Pakistan's premier batsman, but his hapless running between wickets is legendary and most dangerous for his partners. "", ""\nThere were no such problems against New Zealand at a boiling Lahore in 2001-02, when Inzamam belted 329, the second-highest Test score by a Pakistani. However, he was then dogged by poor form, scoring just 16 runs in Pakistan's ill-fated World Cup campaign in 2003. He was dropped from the team briefly, but then roared back to form, scoring a magnificent unbeaten 138 and guiding Pakistan to a thrilling one-wicket win against Bangladesh at Multan. He was rewarded with the captaincy of the team, and despite leading them to victory in the Test series in New Zealand, question-marks about his leadership qualities surfaced when Pakistan were beaten in both the Test series and the one-dayers against India. "", ""\nThe selectors persevered with him and this bore results when he took a team thin on bowling resources to India and drew the Test series with a rousing performance in the final Test, Inzamam's 100th. After scoring a magnificent 184, Inzamam led the team astutely on a tense final day and took Pakistan to victory.  Since that day, Inzamam has gone from strength to strength as captain and premier batsman. By scoring a hundred against West Indies in June 2005, he kept up a remarkable record of match-winning centuries, among the best of modern-day batsmen. "", ""\nA magnificent year ended with Inzamam leading his team to triumph over Ashes-winning England; personally the series was arguably his best ever. He never failed to make a fifty, scored twin centuries at Faisalabad for the first time, going past Miandad as Pakistan's leading century-maker and joining him as only the second Pakistani with 8000 Test runs. "", '\nAs captain, he never looked more a leader, uniting a young, inexperienced team and turning them, once again, into a force to matter globally. The turn of the year brought contemplation; he missed the Test victory over India at Karachi with a persistent back injury. The subsequent ODI thrashing also raised concerns about Inzamam as ODI captain, none of which were entirely wiped away during ODI and Test wins in Sri Lanka. ', ""\nPakistan were then beaten comprehensively in the Test series in England though all was forgotten - including Inzamam's own poor form - by events at The Oval. There, Inzamam, astonishingly for a man perceived as so insouciant, became the most controversial figure in cricket for a week, leading his side off the field in protest at charges of ball tampering made by umpires Billy Doctrove and Darrell Hair. "", ""\nThey refused to come out at first, then delayed the start before eventually forfeiting the Test, the first time in the history of the game. In Pakistan, he became a national hero, saviour of a country's pride and honour.

Even though he expressed his desire to be part of the Test team, Inzamam was not offered a central contract in July and, according to a few, might signal the end of his illustrious international career. "", ""\nHe, however, made that decision himself after signing up for the Indian Cricket League and faced a life-time ban from PCB. He later quit the ICL and made himself available for selection.

He took over as Afghanistan's head coach in October 2015. He began his tenure by helping Afghanistan win their first ODI and T20I series against a Full Member.

He played hardly any domestic cricket in Pakistan: instead he just flew in for home series from Worcestershire or Sussex, or rather from the more fashionable London salons. His averages (37 with the bat, 22 with the ball) put him at the top of the quartet of allrounders (Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee and Kapil Dev being the others) who dominated Test cricket in the 1980s.

He gave no quarter during some memorable battles with West Indies - Pakistan drew three series with them at a time when everybody else was being bounced out of sight - and he led Pakistan to their first series victory in England in 1987, taking 10 for 77 with an imperious display in the decisive victory at Headingley.

Farhat also evokes Saeed Anwar but only fleetingly; he bludgeons rather  than times his runs. He was rather too cavalier in his early appearances in the Test arena, and was promptly discarded after the tour to New Zealand in 2000-01. However, he tightened his game and achieved much more success in the 2003-04 season. Tempering his impressive array of shots with better defensive technique, Farhat scored a deluge of runs in the home series against South Africa and New Zealand, being involved in a record four successive hundred partnerships with Yasir Hameed in the one-day internationals against New Zealand. He also notched up his first century in both Tests and ODIs during this season, and then went on to score a vital 101 in Pakistan's victory against India in the Lahore Test. But since the India series, he has fallen away. A mediocre series at home to Sri Lanka and away to Australia saw him falter, especially with the emergence of the other left-handed opener, Salman Butt. When Pakistan included only one specialist opener in the squad for the series against England in 2005 - Butt - seemingly it confirmed that Farhat, temporarily, was out of national reckoning. But as an opener in Pakistan, you are never out of national reckoning and sure enough Farhat was back for the final Test against India, where he scored a fifty. That performance saw him on the plane to Sri Lanka and an average series. But with openers becoming as rare as dinosuars in Pakistan, he was retained for the summer tour to England, where he again produced some mixed results. Despite failures in the first two Tests, a broken finger and a spate of dropped catches, he came back to score a cavalier 91 in the final, fateful Oval Test. Runs against West Indies at home were followed by a barren patch in South Africa. A first away hundred followed by a patient half-century in the Napier Test of 2009 has set him up for a long sojourn in the Test side.

There was little doubt in the mind of Abdul Hafeez Kardar, Pakistan\'s first Test captain and influential administrator, when he first laid eyes on him as a youngster in the early 70s and famously predicted Miandad ""the find of the decade."" He wasn\'t wrong, as a stupendous debut series against New Zealand in 1976 started to prove. \n', 'Miandad was not of the classical school of batting, though he possessed a beautiful square cut and most shots in and outside the book: he was a fine early reverse-sweeper. But he worked the angles and spaces equally well; he knew above all how to score runs in almost any situation. These qualities presented themselves through his entire career and uniquely, not once did his career average fall below fifty. No Pakistani has scored more Test runs than him and, Inzamam-ul-Haq aside, probably no batsman has won as many matches for Pakistan.   ', 'There was often a touch of genie or genius about his finest innings, like his two hundreds in successive Tests in the West Indies in 1987-88 or the big double hundreds against India and England. Problems on the bouncy pitches of Australia or the swinging ones of England were overcome with time and, if people questioned his record against the West Indies, they never did after that 1987-88 series. ', ""He was versatile as well, as evidenced by a marvellous ODI career. Here his supreme running - it is said that he was one of the early pioneers of aggressive ODI running - shot placement and mental strength produced outstanding results. All qualities came together in a near-miraculous ODI century against India in Sharjah which won the Australasia Cup for Pakistan in 1986. He often saved his best for India, never more so than when he smote Chetan Sharma for a last-ball six to win that final. The match led to years of Pakistani domination over India, particularly in the deserts of Sharjah. In 1992, battling age and back problems, Miandad played a lead role in Pakistan's only World Cup triumph, with six half-centuries."", ""He was also Pakistan's youngest captain and always considered to be the most tactically astute. Imran Khan often acknowledges the role Miandad played as vice-captain with key on-field decisions, though the two were chalk to the other's cheese. But as captain possibly he was too abrasive to get on with all of his players, as at least two player revolts against his leadership suggest. And coinciding with the leadership of Imran, he never captained in as many Tests as he might have done. As with most subcontinent greats, he possibly lingered for longer than might have been advised, finally bowing out in 1996 after, ironically, a loss to India in the World Cup."", ""The problems of captaincy re-emerged when he became Pakistan's coach, where he had his ups and downs. Results were mostly positive but constant bickering from players about his excessively hands-on approach wasn't so good. After three stints in charge, he parted company with the team in 2004 to make way for Bob Woolmer after being blamed for Pakistan's one-day and Test losses to India.\nIn October 2008, Miandad declined an offer to become Pakistan's coach again, but he was soon appointed the PCB's director-general, possibly a role of even greater influence. The move was hailed by many Pakistanis but it didn't last long - Miandad quit the job in January 2009, after differences with the board over the exact scope of his role.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1982'],124.0,189,21,8832.0,280*,52.57,,,23,43,,48,93.0,1.0,233.0,218,41,7381.0,119*,41.7,11014,67.01,8,50,,,71.0,2.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,402.0,632,95,28663,311,53.37,,,80,139,,,340.0,3.0,439.0,407,79,13973,152*,42.60,,,13,101,,,144.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,124.0,36,1470,682,17.0,3/74,5/94,40.11,2.78,86.4,0,0,0,233.0,12,436,297,7.0,2/22,2/22,42.42,4.08,62.2,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,402.0,,12688,6507,191,7/39,,34.06,3.07,66.4,,6,0,439.0,,830,613,18,3/20,3/20,34.05,4.43,46.1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Shoaib Ahmed', ""The life story of Khan Mohammad is not much different from the first batch of Pakistan Test cricketers. Born on New years day 1928, he grew up in the old walled city (Kashmiri Gate) of Lahore. Son of a timber merchant, Jan Mohammad, Khan was the only among the four brothers to take up cricket. He recalls his introduction to the game at Central Model High School, Lahore. There was lot of encouragement to take up the game in that school. Once a week there used to be a thirty-minute period exclusively for cricket. The teachers during this period discussed various aspects of the game, generally without going into technicalities. However Khan shot into fame through club cricket which at that time was at its climax. It was through the annual matches of his club that Khan came into limelight with impressive bowling performances. The competitive nature of cricket in the region helped him to develop his cricket ability at a very young age. It was Khan's combined ability to generate pace without losing control over his line and length and great stamina, that enhanced his reputation among the top-notch pace bowlers of his time. Having a big heart was another essential ingredient that served him well even in poor fielding sides."", ""At 19, he was good enough to be picked for Northern India Cricket Association in the Ranji Trophy, India's leading cricket tournament. In the three zonal matches of the 1946-47 season, he grabbed ten wickets at just above thirty-three a piece to mark his entry into first-class cricket. After the partition of the sub-continent, while at Islamia College Lahore, he was an automatic choice for the Punjab University in the following two seasons."", ""When John Goddard's West Indies side arrived in November 1948 to play in a One-Off unofficial Test, Khan was named the twelfth man, Pakistan skipper Mian Mohammad Saeed having preferred Munawar Ali Khan and Fazal Mahmood to lead the bowling attack at Bagh-e-Jinnah. However, during the tour of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Khan made good use of the heavy atmosphere of the Island. Teaming up with his old Islamia College new-ball partner, Fazal, he topped the tour's bowling average by taking fourteen wickets in the two unofficial Test matches. On the strength of his performance, Khan was able to hold a permanent place in the Pakistan's line-up, until his premature retirement."", ""Looking at Khan's high ratio of bowled and leg-before victims, one might get an impression of him being an express paceman. In fact even at his best he was not more than fast medium, although a shade faster than Fazal Mahmood."", ""In the summer of 1951, Khan played a game for Somerset against the touring South-Africans. In those days an overseas player had to serve a three-year qualifying period to be eligible for appearing in country championship. Khan had also decided to take up residence in the country as well when he was summoned to represent Pakistan against Nigel Howard's touring MCC. In the first unofficial test at Bagh-e-Jinnah, Khan took five wickets in the first innings of a drawn game. In the historic win at Karachi his contribution was seven wickets, with a five wickets haul in the 2nd innings."", ""At this stage of his career, Khan was clearly Pakistan's leading paceman and there was no reason for him not to continue for the next few years. But luck deserted him on the country's first official tour of India in 1952-53. Having spent a summer in Lancashire league, Khan was included in the seventeen-man squad despite doubts on his trouble some groin. In the first Test at New Delhi, he achieved the distinction of taking his country's first Test wicket, of Pankaj Roy, who was bowled round his leg for seven. But after bowling twenty overs on the first day he broke down, that kept him out of the rest of the series. It was a serious below to Pakistan's young and inexperienced side."", ""Helping to establish Pakistan cricket in company with his new ball partner Fazal Mahmood, Khan, though steady and accurate and able to swing the ball considerably in a heavy atmosphere, was prone to strains, and injuries. Soon after the commencement of the first tour of India in 1952-53, Pakistan lost him through injury and in the Caribbean in 1958-59 he could appear in only two Tests. On the first England tour in 1954 his Lancashire league engagement prevented him from playing in more than a handful of matches. However, in the first Test, at Lord's, bowling unchanged with Fazal, he took 5 for 61. In the first official Test series at home against India in 1954-55, he was the most effective bowler on either side, securing 22 wickets (@15.86) in four tests. Specially penetrative in the first innings, he took 4 for 42 in 26.5 over at Dacca, 5 for 74 at Bahawalpur, 4 for 79 at Peshawar and 5 for 72 at Karachi."", 'Against New Zealand in 1955-56 he captured 13 wickets (@ 16.00). In the third Test at Dacca with the ball swinging and keeping low on the soaked matting, he was unplayable with 6 for 21 in 16.2 overs and 2 for 20 in 30 overs (19 maidens). In his last home Test, the first against Australia, at Karachi in 1956-57, he bowled unchanged with Fazal in the first innings, finished with a record 7 for 112, and Pakistan won comfortably. However, his last series, against West Indies in the Caribbean in 1957-58 was a dismal affair in which he played two tests, bowled 54 overs taking no wicket for 259.', 'After saying good-bye to his playing days, he took up MCC coaching courses and soon was to establish his name in this capacity. He served as a coach in MCC indoor school for more than twenty years. He holds an advance Standard Certificate, that qualified him to coach anywhere in the world.

He captained Pakistan in their First Test match in 1952 and was at the forefront of events from then until he resigned from the Pakistani Board in 1977 in protest against Government interference. But he was a Test cricketer before Pakistan even existed, playing for India on the 1946 tour of England under the name Abdul Hafeez. After the tour he added the family name Kardar, stayed in England and went to Oxford to read PPE and enhance his reputation as an idiosyncratic and fearless cricketer: a left-handed batsman, whose response to any bowler or situation was to dance down the track first ball and slam it back over the bowler's head, and a left-arm medium-paced bowler, economical on a good pitch, devastatingly effective on a bad one. Kardar had a couple of productive seasons with Warwickshire, where his successes included marrying the club chairman's daughter, then returned to Pakistan to take on the captaincy. He had learned well under Martin Donnelly and Tom Dollery and, as Test cricket's newcomers, Pakistan at once made themselves worthy of respect rather than anyone's sympathy. In 23 matches as captain, Kardar led his team to victory over all the then Test-playing countries except South Africa, whom they never met. He then became chairman of selectors, and president of Pakistan's Board of Control from 1972 to 1977. In all his positions of authority, he was inclined to be dictatorial and quickly angered, especially by any hint of criticism. In some ways, his prickly brilliance has become characteristic of his country's cricket. But he was also a visionary. He ruthlessly modernised the organisation of the Pakistani game, and many of the themes he was advocating in the 1970s have become common currency among modern administrators: the need to do away with unwieldy committees, to break the post-imperial dominance of Lord's, and to expand the game in Asia. He was an early advocate of neutral umpires. Little of this was well received by his colleagues on ICC at the time. In later years he removed himself from cricket and his last public role was as Pakistan's ambassador to Switzerland. Diplomacy may not have come easily to him. Imran Khan said: After Kardar's retirement, Pakistan cricket was thrown to the wolves, the cricket bureaucrats whose progeny still rule the game.\n"", ' \n']",[],26.0,42,3,927.0,93,23.76,,,0,5,,2,16.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,174.0,262,33,6832,173,29.83,,,8,32,,,110.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.0,26,2712,954,21.0,3/35,5/73,45.42,2.11,129.1,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,174.0,,24256,8448,344,7/25,,24.55,2.08,70.5,,19,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He doesn't flight his offbreaks much, but his excellent control over line and length allows the captain to use him at almost any stage of an innings. He is also one of the better fielders in the Pakistan team, especially in the point region."", 'Despite these skills, Hafeez failed to create a regular place for himself in the Pakistan in his first seven years in international cricket, primarily due to his inability to convert his starts into substantial scores. He scored plenty of pretty 30s and 40s, laced with some exquisite cover-drives, but that only helped cement the opinion that Hafeez may forever remain a player whose potential exceeds performance.', ""To a large extent, that changed in 2011, as Hafeez put in consistent displays with both bat and ball in all forms of the game. It actually started in the series against South Africa in November 2010, and then continued through 2011, a year which fetched him two centuries in Tests and three in ODIs, apart from two fifties in Twenty20 internationals. He won an incredible ten Man-of-the-Match awards in international cricket that year, and became only the third cricketer - after Sanath Jayasuriya and Jacques Kallis - to score 1000-plus runs and take 30 or more wickets in ODIs in a calendar year. With Taufeeq Umar, he formed Pakistan's most stable opening combination in Tests, as his aggression at the top of the order became a perfect counterfoil to Taufeeq's defensive approach. "", ""Since then, Hafeez has continued to frustrate and amaze, and the frequency with which he can switch from one mode to the other is a large part of his enigma. By many metrics, he's one of Pakistan's most prolific cricketers, but arguably also one of the more profligate ones in the way he's handled his immense talent. "", ""The elegance of the full face of his bat, particularly when driving through the off side, means any runs he scores are more memorable than they otherwise might be - and there have been plenty of them; he's number 10 on the all time ODI runs list for Pakistan. There was a century against India in Dhaka that preceded a disappointing barren spell, and then a purple patch against Sri Lanka where he smashed three hundreds in four games in 2013. A swashbuckling unbeaten 57 against India in the Champions Trophy final may ultimately be his most famous innings, as it powered Pakistan to a total they wouldn't let India get close to. "", 'It is his usefulness with the ball, though, that has kept him lingering around the Pakistan setup for so long. His consistency gives his side another option, which explains the reluctance to drop him even when his stock skill - batting - is letting him down. He has opened the bowling for Pakistan on several occasions - particularly in T20 cricket - and briefly took on the mantle of lead spinner after Saeed Ajmal was banned for an illegal action. ', 'That curse, however, has plagued Hafeez throughout his career too, and he has found himself suspended for an illegal bowling action no less than three times. Tellingly, it is in those periods that his place in the side has been in the greatest peril, as his technical flaws as a batsman appear destined to go largely unremedied. He was ignored for a recent series in Zimbabwe, but for a player with 50 Tests, 200 ODIs, a shade under 100 T20Is, and countless comebacks, one would have to be particularly brave to be writing his eulogy just yet.

Even before he went to England on an U-19 tour, he had been picked out as a special talent by Akram himself at a pace camp he oversaw in Lahore in May 2007. By 2010, he had become the hottest pace bowling prospect around the world - but within months his career was in ruins following charges of spot-fixing.  \n', 'He began in 2009 with an impressive showing on the domestic circuit, impressing with his whippy pace and swing. He took 55 wickets for National Bank of Pakistan in his debut season, and earned selection to the Pakistan World T20 squad. There he hit the big time, taking over from an out-of-sorts Sohail Tanvir and bowling with pace, accuracy and courage. ', ""He hovered in the high 80mphs, touching even 90 on occasion and was a crucial opening link in Pakistan's title run. He bowled several nerveless final overs and one absolutely crucial opening over, in the final, when he dismissed tournament top-scorer Tillakaratne Dilshan for a five-ball duck, peppering him with quick, short balls. He carried his form over to the ODI version, picking up match-winning figures of 4 for 28 against Sri Lanka in August before turning in consistent spells in the Champions Trophy. "", 'He picked six wickets on Test debut in Sri Lanka. Thereafter, over tours to New Zealand, Australia and England, he matured remarkably, building up his pace and both new-ball and reverse swing. The 2010 tour of England saw the best of him and he became the youngest bowler, at 18, to take 50 Test wickets. But his world crashed around him when he was implicated in a spot-fixing scam in which it was alleged that he had bowled deliberate, pre-planned no-balls in a Test. In February 2011 he was handed a five-year ban following investigations by an ICC tribunal. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to six months in prison at Southwark Crown Court.', ""After his release, Amir frequently expressed his contrition over the incident and co-operated with the ICC in spreading its anti-corruption message. Having been cleared to return to all forms of cricket in September 2015, he made his international comeback the following January, as part of Pakistan's limited-overs squad to New Zealand. On his next international assignment, the 20-over Asia Cup in Dhaka, he made waves once again, rattling India's top order with three wickets in a hostile spell of pace bowling. Amir's reintegration came full circle when he was selected in the Test squad for England later that year, setting up a comeback Test at Lord's, the venue where the spot-fixing scandal had derailed his career six years before."", 'However, it is in Test cricket, the format supposedly perfectly designed for him to express his wizardry, that he has disappointed most profoundly. Magical spells with the new ball have been all too fleeting, and his performances in the three countries where conditions are arguably best suited to him, have been largely indifferent. With the ball, he averaged 42.41 in England in 2016, 28.83 in New Zealand that same year, and 61.60 when Australia whitewashed Pakistan at the turn of the year. The prodigious banana swing from that titillating left-arm angle - and that quite beautiful bowling action - does come, but not nearly as potently or regularly as memory suggests it did in his teenage years. In other words, Amir, in Test cricket, has flattered to deceive. ', ""It depends on what he wants to be remembered for, though, because if he wishes to live for famous moments rather than a stellar career, he's got the biggest one tucked up already. In the Champions Trophy final against India, it was his opening salvo that put the game out of India's reach. Defending 338, he trapped Rohit Sharma in front in the first over, before taking Virat Kohli's outside edge twice in two balls - the first was dropped in the slips. Shikhar Dhawan fell at Amir's hands too, with the fast bowler's figures reading 6-2-16-3, as Pakistan stormed to victory by 180 runs. \n"", '\n']",[],36.0,67,11,751.0,48,13.41,1980,37.92,0,0,91,3,5.0,0.0,50.0,27,9,352.0,73*,19.55,430,81.86,0,2,31,8,6.0,0.0,42.0,11,4,44.0,21*,6.28,58,75.86,0,0,1,2,4.0,0.0,66.0,100,15,1334,66,15.69,3007,44.36,0,2,164,12,15.0,0.0,72.0,35,15,402,73*,20.10,500,80.40,0,2,36,8,11.0,0.0,122.0,45,20,180,21*,7.20,196,91.83,0,0,10,6,11.0,0.0,36.0,67,7619,3627,119.0,6/44,7/64,30.47,2.85,64.0,6,4,0,50.0,50,2473,1971,60.0,4/28,4/28,32.85,4.78,41.2,1,0,0,42.0,42,936,1066,55.0,4/13,4/13,19.38,6.83,17.0,1,0,0,66.0,119,12214,5786,254,7/61,10/72,22.77,2.84,48.0,10,13,2,72.0,72,3650,2805,101,5/36,5/36,27.77,4.61,36.1,1,1,0,122.0,120,2688,3025,147,4/13,4/13,20.57,6.75,18.2,3,0,0,False,False,False,False

Taking over as leader immediately after that episode at the age of 36, Misbah's calm approach was exactly what Pakistan cricket needed after the tumultuous period it had gone through. \n"", ""As a batsman, Misbah can either defend dourly with unflagging patience, or irritate bowlers with his improvisations.

Instead, he became the first Pakistan captain since the great Imran Khan to win a 50-over world title.  \n"", 'Sarfraz took over the ODI reins in February 2017, providing his side with rare single-minded direction and focus. In June that year, Pakistan went into the Champions Trophy as the lowest-ranked team and lost heavily against India to start off, but then went on a red-hot run to beat South Africa, Sri Lanka and hosts England, and finally India to claim the prize. ', ""A right-hand middle-order batsman, Sarfraz wasn't always the sprightly presence that bossed the Sharjah Test of 2014 - when Pakistan chased 302 in 57.3 overs to level the series. In fact, between 2007 - when he made his debut - and 2014, Sarfraz had played just four Tests, four T20Is and 26 ODIs. He was miles off being a regular in any of Pakistan's sides, and not nearly good enough to warrant a place as a specialist batsman; he hadn't scored an international half-century in all this time. It was an era when the Akmals - no less than three of them - had taken out a lease on the area behind the stumps. "", ""Sarfraz had appeared on Pakistan's radar initially by leading Pakistan's Under-19s to the World Cup title in 2006, scoring half-centuries in his third and fourth match. He broke into domestic cricket, where 523 runs in 10 matches along with 28 dismissals behind the stumps pushed him into the A team's tour of Australia in 2007. Then he was left in the wilderness. "", ""It took seven long years for the spotlight to return to Sarfraz, when he made 74 in Pakistan's total of 359 in the second innings against Sri Lanka in Dubai. The innings was in a losing cause, but it did establish him as the team's first-choice wicketkeeper. He averaged 71.20 over the next 18 months, and during this period also elbowed his way into the ODI side midway through the 2015 World Cup campaign with a run-a-ball 49 against South Africa. "", ""Since then, Sarfraz has been a man for all formats, steady with the gloves, aggressive with the bat and street-smart as a captain across formats.

Saqlain Mushtaq was perhaps the first offspinner to master the doosra, a\ndelivery that spins away from the batsman even though it is delivered\nwith an offspinner's action. Saqlain has a fast, short-stepping action with a halting delivery, and has a propensity to bowl no-balls, unusually for a bowler with such a short run. He is criticised for attempting too much variation and he often throws in the doosra the first time a batsman faces. Saqlain's international career got off to a splendid start - he was the fastest bowler to 100 one-day wickets, and his phenomenal control meant that he regularly bowled at the death. But his finest moment arguably came in a Test match, at Chennai in 1998-99, when his ten-for allowed Pakistan to sneak nerve-tingling 12-run win against India. However, his stock has fallen a long way since then, with Shoaib Malik, a better batsman than Saqlain, usurping the spinner's spot in the ODI line-up and Danish Kaneria becoming the frontline Test spinner. Saqlain did get an opportunity to have a go at the Indians again in the 2003-04 series, but unflattering figures of 1 for 204 at Multan meant that he was quickly consigned to the scrap heap. He was unable to force his way back ahead of Danish Kaneria and he was blighted by injury after a prolific time with Surrey. However, his career was given a lifeline in 2007 when he joined Mushtaq Ahmed at Sussex and there was even talk of him qualifying for England.

All went well at first in South Africa in 1997-98 until he found, like Rameez Raja and Aamir Sohail, that certain senior players did not want things to change. He made a surprise return to the colours for the 2001 tour of England, and got a second shot at the captaincy when Waqar Younis was sacked after Pakistan\'s miserable performance at the 2003 World Cup. There was more controversy to follow, though. He kept up his crusade to clean up the game, writing an open letter to the ICC, warning of the dangers of ""fancy fixing"".

In 2011 he was the leading wicket-taker in Tests, with 50 in eight matches. But the best series of his young career came early in 2012, when he destroyed the batting line-up of the best team in the world, England, taking 24 wickets in just three games at 14.70. In the process, he clearly won the battle of offspinners against the highly rated Graeme Swann. ', "" However, Ajmal first made his mark in international cricket in ODIs. He was called up for the 2008 Asia Cup, and soon after he had the Australians completely bewildered in the ODI series in the UAE; he gave away few runs and his doosra was almost unreadable. The ICC called him for his action, though it was cleared soon after. The pressure didn't get to him and immediately after, he played a crucial role in Pakistan's drive to the 2009 World Twenty20 title, regularly bottling up the middle overs with Shahid Afridi.

While Pakistan were embroiled in several off-field controversies during that period - the spot-fixing scandal in England and Zulqarnain Haider fleeing to the UK happened during those 18 months - the on-field results were pretty good: Pakistan drew a Test series in South Africa, won in New Zealand, and reached the semi-final of the 2011 World Cup.

On a lifeless pitch, he was a master of the percentage game, his caution a useful counterpoint to the risks taken by Sanath Jayasuriya, his opening partner almost throughout his Test career. All his big Test innings - he scored six double-hundreds in his career, a feat bettered only by Don Bradman (12), Wally Hammond and Brian Lara (seven each) - were been slow affairs but the most tortuous episode of his international career was its start: it took him nearly seven years to get established. However, since the 1990s his average climbed upwards. An elegant player to watch, Atapattu's signature shot was his high-elbow cover-drive. \n"", ""For three years he stood as Jayasuriya's understudy before being appointed to lead the one-day side in April 2003. He had been expected to take charge of the Test team as well, but the selection committee appointed Hashan Tillakaratne for that job. Atapattu's career took another bizarre twist later in the year when embroiled in the cash-in-the-bedroom affair in which a match-fixing investigation was initiated after a large sum of cash was discovered in the safe of the hotel room he had occupied during England's tour in 2003. The ICC later cleared Atapattu of any wrongdoing and the likeliest explanation for the mystery remains a crude attempt to blacken his reputation."", ""But by early 2004 the team was drifting downwards under Tillakaratne and the selectors were finally compelled to appoint Atapattu as the Test captain. Within weeks he had halted the team's slide and established himself as a strong leader. On the surface a quiet and reserved character, his captaincy pedigree was not entirely obvious to the outsider, but within the dressing-room he was a straight-talking and positive captain, firm and fair in his dealings with the players and aggressive in his approach to the game. By mid-2004 the fortunes of the team had changed as Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup and whitewashed South Africa. The team fared poorly in the ICC Champions Trophy but perked up against Pakistan in October 2004."", ""But Atapattu's capacity for attracting the unexpected continued when, out of the blue, Ashantha de Mel, the new government-appointed chairman of selectors, launched a scathing attack on the team management on the eve of the Paktel Cup in 2004-05, accusing them of blocking his attempts to blood new players. Atapattu wisely steered clear of a public confrontation, though his relationship with the selectors remained prickly. "", 'His career was put on hold by a back injury early in 2006 which led to Mahela Jayawardene taking on the captaincy. He was slowly reintroduced to the one-day side, but his tussles with the selectors continued. He was a late inclusion on the Australian tour following a ministerial intervention to bring him into the squad, but midway through the series he hit out at the selectors again, calling them ""a set of muppets headed by a joker"". He scored two half-centuries in the series, including 80 in the second innings in Hobart, but announced his retirement from international cricket on the last day of the Test.   ', 'Atapattu then joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League, playing for the Delhi Giants and ICL World XI. A ban on he and four other Sri Lankans was lifted in September 2008, meaning Atapattu was free to play domestic cricket back home.', ""Since retirement from all cricket, Atapattu has forged a reputation as a technically adroit and hard-working batting coach, particularly for his work with the Sri Lanka team. He has been the national side's batting coach since 2011, and was promoted to the position of assistant coach in March 2013.

A Test average of over 50, a triple-hundred, a famous double-hundred against India in India, and a brilliant rearguard partnership to clinch Pakistan's 3-0 Test whitewash over England, leave no doubt about his quality and class. He is also one of the most successful fielders for Pakistan, and can bowl respectable slow-medium. As a captain, Younis has enjoyed success in leading Pakistan to the world Twenty20 title in 2009.\n \nMuch of his persona evokes the idea of the quintessential Pathan warrior - committed, inspired, capable, and bearing the burden of conflict with fortitude and poise. Born in Mardan, a prominent city in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Younis moved at an early age to Karachi, where he caught the eye of Rashid Latif and Saeed Anwar at Malir Gymkhana, one of the city's renowned sports clubs. The relationship with Latif blossomed into a nurturing mentorship, guiding Younis towards entry onto the world stage. After two impressive domestic seasons, he got a Test call-up, and marked it with a century on debut.\n \nStyle and aesthetics are not his strongest points. His technique relies on a good deal of bottom hand, which deprives it of the fluidity and grace that is typical of Asia's best batsmen. Yet when Younis gets going, he produces results in the face of steep odds.\n \nIndeed, the steeper the odds, the more Younis seems to thrive. His match-winning 267 and 84 not out in Bangalore came after a string of low scores prompted a sarcastic comment from the team manager that leaked into the media. His greatest captaincy feat - the world Twenty20 championship in England - was achieved weeks after Pakistan cricket had been devastated by the terror attacks in Lahore. And though his triple-century came at home on a flat track, the innings began under pressure when Younis, eschewing the nightwatchman, stepped out himself in the dying moments of the second day with Pakistan staring at a huge Sri Lankan total. Unsurprisingly for a rearguard specialist, Younis has emerged a master of the fourth innings. Among players with 1000 or more fourth-innings Test runs, his average is among the highest.\n \nAlong with these accomplishments, Younis's career has also seen turmoil. Inability to control infighting within the team and display tact with the PCB led to him losing the captaincy in late 2009, and he effected a moody refusal when circumstances changed and it was offered again. His nature is to be inward-looking and intensely focused, quietly fighting his way through. While this makes for a reclusive personality that shuns the media and runs afoul of officialdom, it has also been the source of Younis's batting strength and his extraordinary resilience as a cricketer."", ' \n']",[],118.0,213,19,10099.0,313,52.05,19375,52.12,34,33,1082,70,139.0,0.0,265.0,255,23,7249.0,144,31.24,9628,75.29,7,48,578,56,135.0,0.0,25.0,23,3,442.0,51,22.10,364,121.42,0,2,31,12,12.0,0.0,229.0,385,42,17116,313,49.90,,,56,64,,,243,0,351.0,331,36,9911,144,33.59,,,12,64,,,196.0,0.0,83.0,78,17,1864,71*,30.55,1589,117.30,0,10,144,37,34,0,118.0,31,804,491,9.0,2/23,4/50,54.55,3.66,89.3,0,0,0,265.0,20,284,288,3.0,1/3,1/3,96.0,6.08,94.6,0,0,0,25.0,1,22,18,3.0,3/18,3/18,6.00,4.9,7.3,0,0,0,229.0,,3620,2120,44,4/52,,48.18,3.51,82.2,,0,0,351.0,,1169,1127,28,3/5,3/5,40.25,5.78,41.7,0,0,0,83.0,7,104,136,6,3/18,3/18,22.66,7.84,17.3,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

The early signs were promising then, but he developed a worrying tendency to waste his starts, making pretty 20s and then throwing it away, often by flailing at wide ones outside off. That saw him lose his place in the team in late 2004. Selectorial inconsistencies didn't help, Hameed being dropped the next match after scoring two fifties in a Test at Syndey.

He loves to make room and thrash the ball through the off side, but the stroke that bears his signature more than any other is the one he developed for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 - the eponymously named ""Dilscoop"" shot over his head, which confounded bowlers and experts alike. \n', 'In fact, 2009 was a watershed year in his career, and a huge factor was his move up the batting order to open the innings in all three forms of the game.

Add his electric fielding, especially at backward point, and his underrated offspin, and Dilshan is a quality package. In 2011 he was named Sri Lanka's captain, after the resignation of Kumar Sangakkara, but his reign lasted less than a year, with Mahela Jayawardene replacing him after Sri Lanka's tour to South Africa in 2011-12.

When Duleep Mendis was injured early on the 1982-83 tour of New Zealand, de Silva was handed the honour of\nleading Sri Lanka in two Tests.

A technically sound batsman with strokes all around the wicket, Chandimal also stands out because of the maturity he shows at the crease and his temperament to build and pace an innings. \n', ""He made his international debut when only 21, and impressed almost immediately, scoring 111 in his second ODI, against India in the 2010 triangular series in Zimbabwe. Four innings later, he made another century, this time against England at Lord's, but his stocks rose significantly in 2012, when he performed superbly in ODIs on successive tours to South Africa and Australia. In conditions he wouldn't have been used to, Chandimal occupied the crucial No.4 slot and revelled in the responsibility, scoring consistently. In 16 ODI innings in those two series, he aggregated 630 runs, including six fifties. He was equally impressive on his Test debut too, scoring fifties in each innings in Durban as Sri Lanka won their first Test in South Africa. "", ""A dip in his limited overs form, especially at home, saw Chandimal dropped from the side during the latter half of 2012, though he remained in the Sri Lanka squad for all three formats. He returned to the Test side at the SCG for the New Year Test, and hit an unbeaten 67, batting alongside the tail. Six weeks later he became Sri Lanka's youngest ever captain, at 23, when he was handed the reins of Sri Lanka's top-ranked Twenty20, and was also named Angelo Mathews' deputy in Tests and ODIs. He celebrated his elevation with back-to-back Test hundreds against Bangladesh at home. "", ""Chandimal's rise to the national team came after consistent performances with bat and gloves at age-level cricket. That included an attacking century against India Under-19s in August 2007 and an unbeaten 112 in the tri-nation series against England U-19s the following year earned him a call-up to the squad for the U-19 World Cup in Malaysia in 2008."", ""Shortly after completing a prolific season for Colombo's Ananda College, Chandimal was invited to join Nondescripts Cricket Club by Kumar Sangakkara. Chandimal was only 19 when scored his maiden first-class century against New Zealand in 2009, representing a Sri Lanka Cricket Development XI in two three-day practice matches against the likes of Chris Martin, Darryl Tuffey, Ian O'Brien, Jacob Oram and Daniel Vettori. He was among the leading run-getters in Sri Lanka's Interprovincial Twenty20 competition, and won a call-up to the national side for the ICC World Twenty20 in 2010. Soon after, the international opportunities followed, and Chandimal has made the most of them."", '\n']",[],53.0,97,7,3768.0,164,41.86,7667,49.14,11,17,401,22,76.0,10.0,146.0,132,21,3599.0,111,32.42,4855,74.12,4,22,245,39,59.0,7.0,54.0,47,4,800.0,58,18.60,766,104.43,0,4,73,16,32.0,5.0,109.0,186,17,7741,244,45.80,13229,58.51,22,36,835,96,163,24,227.0,208,29,6023,119*,33.64,7726,77.95,9,37,436,90,106.0,17.0,120.0,108,14,2687,101*,28.58,2292,117.23,1,16,236,68,68,20,53.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,146.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,54.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,109.0,3,36,18,1,1/13,1/13,18.00,3.00,36.0,0,0,0,227.0,1,6,1,1,1/1,1/1,1.00,1.00,6.0,0,0,0,120.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

His batting gained a new authority and his bowling greater potency, as he topped both the batting and bowling averages in that unofficial Test series. A wonderfully supple fielder, capable of match-turning run-outs and sizzling airbourne catches, he was in and out of both the Test and one-day squads for a number of years before bedding down in the one-day team in mid-2003 after a match-winning innings at Bridgetown. His explosive qualities in the middle order made him an asset in the limited-overs game. But his bowling has also continued to improve, making him a better bet for Tests as well. Murali's withdrawal from the tour to Australia in 2004 put additional responsibility on him, and he responded well. As the year progressed, his legbreaks, traditionally nagging rather than explosive, started to fizz more venomously. More importantly, his line and length tightened up. By the end of the Asia Cup in 2004 he had become an important wicket-taker in the one-day team, but his form fell away and he was dropped late in 2005, making one rather unexpected one-day appearance in July 2007, retiring soon after. Chandana then joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League, playing for the Kolkata Tigers and ICL World XI.

Most of the time during that period, though, his role was to bowl long spells block the runs and build pressure on the batsmen, allowing Murali to work his magic from the other end.', ""Since Murali's retirement, Herath has been Sri Lanka's go-to bowler.

His sheer quality as a batsman was never in doubt even when he just entered the international scene, but for Jayawardene the biggest challenge has been to justify all the early hype. With over 10,000 runs in both Tests and ODIs - and a captaincy stint that included a World Cup final appearance - it can safely be said that he has met that challenge more than adequately. \n', 'Blessed with excellent hand-eye coordination and a fine technique, Jayawardene scores his runs all around the wicket. Among his favourite strokes are the languid cover-drive - often with minimal footwork but precise placement and timing - and the wristy flick off his legs, but there are several others he plays with equal felicity. The most memorable are the cuts and dabs he plays behind the stumps, mostly off spinners, but also against quick bowling, when bat makes contact with ball delightfully late. Apart from his artistry, what stands out about his batting is his hunger for big scores, most apparent in his record 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara, but also in the regularity with which he notches up Test double-hundreds. And his century against Zimbabwe in the World Twenty20 in 2010 was a shining example of traditional methods succeeding in a new format.', 'Jayawardene is easily one of the most elegant batsmen of his generation, but the major drawback in his career is his relative lack of success in overseas conditions. His averages in Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are all less than 35, but at home he averages more than 60.', ""In the second half of his career, Jayawardene grew into an astute captain who read the game well and wasn't afraid to take risks. Under him, Sri Lanka shed their diffident approach, winning Tests in England and New Zealand, and - in what was Jayawardene's greatest achievement as captain - reached the final of the 2007 World Cup. He quit captaincy in February 2009, but agreed to a second stint, taking over from Tillakaratne Dilshan after the tour to South Africa in 2011-12, but resigned again after a year, handing the reins to Angelo Mathews. "", 'His limited overs batting has improved with age, and an increasing stroke repertoire has seen Jayawardene become almost as impressive an innovator at the crease, as he is a technician.

You recall a man who could score equally briskly in every form of the game, who slashed and burned his way through bowling attacks. As with anyone who relied so much on extraordinary hand-eye coordination, there were troughs and lean times, but just as the obit writers got busy, he would produce another innings of supreme power. The bowling, always canny and relying more on variations in pace than sharp turn, became the supporting act, though 440 international wickets should tell you that he was pretty adept at what he did. \n"", ""Following Mark Greatbatch's success at the 1992 World Cup, most teams were rethinking the way they approached the one-day game and Jayasuriya, who had trawled the lower reaches of the middle order till then, had his first stint as opener during the Hero Cup in India in 1993. It was only during a home series against Pakistan the following year that he established himself in the role and by the time the World Cup rolled around 18 months later, he had already chalked up his first century in whites, a frenetic stroke-filled effort in Adelaide.

People remember Aravinda de Silva's magical innings from the semi-final and final of  the 1996 World Cup but it was Jayasuriya's withering assaults that deflated India in Delhi and England in the last eight. Soon after, he began to exact as heavy a toll on Test attacks, scoring at such a pace that Muttiah Muralitharan and friends had ample time to work their way through opposition batsmen."", ""After Arjuna Ranatunga's ouster, there was a four-year stint as captain that ended with a semi-final appearance at the 2003 World Cup, and just as the whispers grew about diminishing returns with the bat, he had one of his most successful years in 2004.

For the believers, he's among the greatest to ever spin a ball. For the doubters, he's a charlatan undeserving of the game's greatest records, responsible for changes in the laws that they think have legitimised throwing. What was undeniable was his ability to turn the ball sharply on just about any surface, and bowl the sort of marathon spells that would have seen a lesser man retire after five seasons rather than 18. Whether Sri Lanka played at home, on pitches where he was often unplayable, or overseas, Murali was the go-to man for half a dozen captains. He seldom disappointed. \n"", ""Scion of a family with confectionery interests in Kandy, he first came to prominence during a tour game against Australia in 1992-93, when no less a batsman than Allan Border failed to pick him. From the outset, his action was an object of wonder or ridicule, depending on which side of the fence you stood. A deformed elbow was only part of the story. Murali had exceptionally supple wrists and a shoulder that rotated as rapidly as a fast bowler's at the time of delivery. A combination of all these factors combined to enable him to turn the ball far more than most orthodox finger-spinners, but it was only with his mastering the doosra, the one that went the other way or held its line, that he became Shane Warne's rival in the wicket-taking and greatness stakes. "", 'The controversies always kept him company, yet Murali seldom lost his wide-eyed smile, or the ability to run through batting sides. Darrell Hair called him for throwing on Boxing Day in 1995, and Ross Emerson followed suit three years later. In 2004, he was asked to refrain from bowling his doosra, after it was found to exceed the 15-degree tolerance limit that had been agreed on after extensive analysis of his and other actions. While the sceptics continued to denigrate his achievements, Murali even bowled on television in a special cast, going through his entire repertoire to try and convince the doubters.', ""Part of the World Cup-winning side in 1996, he was instrumental in the run to the final 11 years later, and he played his part in some of the country's greatest sporting moments. It was his 16 wickets that helped rout England at The Oval in 1998, back in the days when Sri Lanka were deemed worthy of only one Test. He averaged less than 30 with the ball in every country except India and Australia, and he finished a remarkable Test career with more than 100 wickets against India, England and South Africa. "", 'Backed to the hilt by Arjuna Ranatunga, he blossomed in the late 1990s, and there was a period when the opposition routinely budgeted for 20 Murali wickets or more in a three-Test series.

That yorker, a deceptive slower ball, and an excellent bouncer formed the body of Malinga's menace, while the action made his deliveries hard to pick up. All that ability was also set off by street smarts; Malinga was rarely shy to switch up plans, and reshuffle fields. Even when batsmen thought they knew what was about to come, Malinga retained the capacity to surprise. \n"", 'Found in his teens playing soft-ball cricket on the beaches of Rathgama, just north of Galle, Malinga became one of the poster boys for the informal Sri Lankan coaching system and its philosophy of equipping unconventional bowlers, rather than remaking them. Malinga has repeatedly credited Champaka Ramanayake for his success. It was Ramanayake who initially took interest in him, and with whom he developed the yorker that became the foundation of his career. The coach would glue a pair of shoes near the popping crease. Malinga would spend hours bowling at them. ', 'Initially picked for his pace, Malinga toured Australia with the Sri Lanka team in 2004, where he claimed 6 for 90 in a tour match and went on to make his Test debut - he dismissed Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in the same over, in Darwin. During an impressive tour of New Zealand the following year, his low-slung action resulted in the New Zealand batsmen asking the umpire to change the colour of their trousers as the ball was getting lost.', ""But it was in the shorter formats that destiny beckoned Malinga. He became the first - and, so far, only - bowler to claim four wickets in four balls, when he took Sri Lanka to the brink of victory against South Africa, in the 2007 World Cup. He has two more ODI hat-tricks - against Australia and Kenya - and he quickly established himself as Sri Lanka's limited-overs spearhead. Though Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan also played important roles, Malinga was arguably the single-most important player in Sri Lanka's excellent run in global tournaments from 2007-2014."", 'It is felt Malinga never realised his full potential in Tests, though perhaps through no fault of his own. He was only the third player to reach 100 Test wickets for Sri Lanka but a knee injury in 2008 laid him low for two years. He was picked again for Muttiah Muralitharan\'s farewell series, but again found himself injured for a period of some months. In April 2011, at the age of 27, Malinga announced his Test retirement, citing the desire to manage his ""chronic knee injury"" and extend his limited-overs career. It is thought his unique bowling action places a substantial load on the joints in his hips and legs. However, the fact that he announced his retirement while playing for Mumbai Indians in the IPL rankled at home. Through the forthcoming years, Malinga would go on to have a complicated relationship with Sri Lankan fans and media. In that time, he also became one of the IPL\'s iconic figures, representing Mumbai throughout.', ""Malinga's finest moment came during the 2014 World T20, in which he nominally captained the side through the knockouts but, more importantly, delivered a clinical final spell to muzzle the India middle order. Sri Lanka would go on to win that title but, before long, Malinga's career became threatened by fitness issues - both involuntary and self-inflicted. In late 2014, a long-standing ankle complaint deteriorated to the extent that it required surgery. Malinga was a diminished force through the 2015 World Cup and became significantly slower in his later years, in which he also put on weight. "", ""He stepped down as T20 captain ahead of Sri Lanka's 2016 World T20 campaign, again owing to a chronic knee injury, this time in his left leg. He has at times suggested that his career hangs in the balance as a result of these injuries. At others he has said he wishes to play on for another few years.

As his career developed so did his batting, such was his ability he was asked to open the batting at test level and did so with success. Perhaps his greatest attribute was his tenacity and resolve, always willing to compete in a side that was usually less than competitive. Scripted into the side as a 21 year old, Ratnayeke was originally selected as a specialist bowler. On the unresponsive wickets in Pakistan he toiled in relative obscurity earning four expensive wickets and batting as low as No. 10. Wickets and runs were difficult to come by at first, but the selectors persevered and against New Zealand at the SSC he had a breakthrough when he took 5 for 42. The back-to-back series against Pakistan enabled Ratnayeke cement his position in the side with impressive displays with the ball and his ever improving batting provided valuable runs in the lower order. At Sialkot he produced a devastating display wrecking the Pakistan innings with figures of 8 for 83, the figures remaining the benchmark for all Sri Lankan bowlers until recent times. Pushed into the opening position on the tour of India in 1985-86, Ratnayeke responded to the added responsibility.

He topped the 2013-14 first-class season's wicket-takers' list, with 54 scalps at an average of 19.14. For those efforts, Sandakan earned a place in Sri Lanka's ODI squad to play England at home in late 2014, though he never played a game."", ""In the following season, Sandakan was again impressive, with 45 wickets at 24.28. When he went on to top the wicket-taker's list for the second time in three seasons, in the 2015-16 Premier League Tournament, the national selectors rewarded him with a place in the A team squad to England. Sandakan took 5 for 40 in a List A match against Derbyshire on that tour, and was given a second call-up to the national squad almost immediately, thanks in part to injuries to several frontline Sri Lanka players.

In his second avatar he has added more strokes to make his batting more well-rounded, but what Samaraweera does best is wear bowlers down through patient and relentless accumulation. His batting is built around reserves of resilience, determination and sheer toughness, and he had to draw into them all to overcome the trauma of cricket's darkest hours - the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore. \n"", ' \nSamaraweera will forever be remembered for not letting a bullet injury end his international career. He was in his best form, having scored two consecutive double-centuries in Pakistan, when his team bus came under fire in March 2009 and a bullet penetrated 12 inches into his left thigh. He needed surgery and spent three months dealing with the physical and mental wounds of his ordeal.

The retirements of Aravinda de Silva and Hashan Tillakaratne gave Samaraweera a run in the middle order but indifferent form in 2006 led to him being dropped. He returned 18 months later, a more aggressive, prolific batsman and yet remained as solid as he was before, reigniting his career with a century against India in July 2008. It was the beginning of a purple patch which continued even after his run-in with gunmen.', ""Despite all the runs Samaraweera scored, question-marks remained due to his relative lack of success outside the subcontinent. Worse was to follow when he went through a wretched run of form against Australia at home, in 2011. He was subsequently dropped for the Tests against Pakistan in UAE, but defeat in that series forced the selectors to recall him for the South Africa tour. Samaraweera responded in style with two centuries when some of his more illustrious team-mates struggled to put bat to ball. Samaraweera's finest hour came when his century in Durban delivered Sri Lanka their first win in South Africa. "", ""Though he had a moderately successful year in 2012, Samaraweera was the most notable batting failure in Sri Lanka's year-end tour of Australia. Despite scoring plenty of runs in the domestic season thereafter, he didn't find a place in Sri Lanka's squad for the home Test series against Bangladesh.

A late developer, Vandort played only one first-class match for St Joseph's First XI, but he quickly made an impression. He was then picked for a Board XI side against India in August 2001 and booked himself a berth in Sri Lanka's 16-man Test squad on the back of an impressive century. He sat on the sidelines throughout the series, but was finally given a chance against Bangladesh in 2001 when the selectors rested senior players. However, despite scoring a century in the second Test, he then waited three-and-half-years before reclaiming a place in the national squad. Opportunities were restricted due to the established Jayasuriya-Atapattu opening combination, but many argue he has nonetheless been unfairly ignored by the selectors.  An injury to Sanath Jayasuriya paved the way for his ODI debut against Australia at Melbourne in February 2006. He top scored with a gritty but slow 48 but was then dropped for the rest of his series. He played two Tests in the Bangladesh series that followed, again showing an impressive adhesiveness and is particularly strong off the front foot, through the off-side and leg-side.

He swings and seams the ball with skill, his trademark delivery being the late indipper. However, he also bowls a carefully disguised offcutter, and has recently added reverse-swing to his armoury, a skill that has made him a consistent wicket-taker even on bland subcontinental pitches. He outbowled New Zealand's seamers in green conditions at Napier to give Sri Lanka their first win in an overseas Test, in 1994-95. In 2001-02 he made a quantum leap, taking 26 wickets in the 3-0 rout of West Indies, becoming only the second fast bowler, after Imran Khan, to take 14 wickets in a match in the subcontinent. He then went on to take the first-ever ODI eight-for, against Zimbabwe, which included a hat-trick. He also claimed a hat-trick with the first three balls of the match against Bangladesh in the 2003 World Cup. Vaas reached the 300-wicket milestone in Tests against India in 2005-06, having passed the mark in ODIs on the tour to Zimbabwe. In 2004 he also gained overdue recognition for his talent when he was selected for the World XI at the inaugural ICC Awards. Vaas is easily Sri Lanka's second-most successful bowler - after Muttiah Muralitharan - in both forms of the game. His approach to his batting is equally sincere and in recent years he has gradually gained recognition as a useful allrounder.

He finished the three-match tournament with an aggregate of 421 runs, at 105.25, which included two successive undefeated centuries at Eden Gardens.

His first strides into Test cricket - during the home series against Bangladesh in 2007 - were hardly auspicious, as he was dismissed off his first ball.

His stronger suit is his pace bowling, and he returned the best figures by a Zimbabwean on Test debut - 5 for 73 in the first Test against Bangladesh at Bulawayo in April 2001. He also managed a first-ball duck in his maiden Test innings, although as a strokeplaying left-hander, he has a terrific eye for the ball and is also a fine fielder. After growing disenchanted with the game he sat out the 2001-02 season, amid reports of disputes with administrators and fellow players. He pursued a number of lines of employment including, briefly, male modelling. But in August 2002 he announced that he was returning, and in his first game back he took 5 for 79 against Pakistan. He then cemented his place back in the team and put in steady performances during the 2003 World Cup and in England later in the same year.   \n', ""But he was one of the 15 rebel players who was involved in the stand-off with the Zimbabwe board and was ultimately sacked by them. In June 2004 he joined the growing exodus from Zimbabwe by signing for Tasmania, and also had a brief stint with Durham during the English summer.  But Tasmania released him from his contract early - his spell was dogged by injury - and in February 2005 he returned 'unconditionally' to Zimbabwe.  He was part of the strike against the board later in the year, and spent 2005-06 playing for the Lions in South Africa. He was for a time touted as successor to Tatenda Taibu as captain, but refused to play until he was paid substantial monies owed to him by the board.

He claimed six wickets in the two Tests but his next experience, against South Africa, was a much sterner challenge and he was viciously dealt with by Graeme Smith, AB de Villers and Jacques Kallis. He was on a hiding to nothing but such was the ferocity of the assault one felt for his state of mind, although to his credit he eventually dismissed all three.\n \nZimbabwe's involvement in Test cricket was suspended soon afterward, and Cremer had to wait four years for another chance in the national side, eventually making his one-day debut against Kenya at Mombasa in January 2009.

Chigumbura acquitted himself admirably in the first match at Bangalore, dominating his 67-run partnership with Shaun Pollock with a combative 40. He also played a vital role in Zimbabwe's victory over Australia at the World Twenty20 in South Africa, removing both openers and rotating the strike well as Zimbabwe squeaked home in the final over.

He tormented the Kenyan bowlers, smashing consecutive scores of 79, 68, 43 and 36 at a strike rate well above a-run-a-ball, and picking up seven wickets for good measure.  He followed that up with a starring allround performance in the first match of the ODI series in Bangladesh, taking three cheap wickets and guiding Zimbabwe home with an unbeaten 60, but could not replicate his form in the remaining games of the series.

Selected for the 1992 World Cup at only 19, he struggled against world-class bowling, but the experience was invaluable. He soon became a fixture in the national side, and greatly impressed on the 1993-94 Pakistan tour, playing some excellent innings against one of the strongest bowling attacks in the world. His aggressive style has proved effective in one-day internationals, but his wish to dominate the bowling has led to difficulties in building big innings in Test matches. After being stuck on a Test-best of 99 for five years, he finally scored his first century, against India at Nagpur in 2000-01, and followed that up with 103 the following summer against West Indies. Campbell plays a wide range of shots, generating power without apparent effort. He occasionally bowls right-arm offspin, and is a magnificent fielder in any position. On taking over the captaincy in 1996, he led Zimbabwe to some notable successes including their remarkable series victory in Pakistan in 1998-99, and their qualification to the Super Sixes in the 1999 World Cup. However, he stood down from the captaincy in November 1999, citing personal reasons. He abruptly announced his retirement from international cricket under a cloud after he was originally overlooked for the 2003 World Cup, but was later brought back in to replace the injured Mark Vermeulen, and then when the selectors hinted that he wasn't needed for the England tour later that year.  He quit soon after for a time ran Lilfordia Junior School in Harare with his father, Iain, a prominent junior coach who has groomed a number of Zimbabwe's cricketers. Amid the re-vamping of Zimbabwe's domestic structure in 2009-10, which involved the return of a handful of former cricketers to administrative roles, Campbell was appointed chairman of selectors by the ZC board. \n"", ' \n']",[],60.0,109,4,2858.0,103,27.21,6843,41.76,2,18,355,4,60.0,0.0,188.0,184,14,5185.0,131*,30.5,7834,66.18,7,30,,,76.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,129.0,223,25,6701,196,33.84,,,11,38,,,133.0,0.0,248.0,240,26,7098,131*,33.16,,,9,43,,,95.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,60.0,6,66,28,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.54,-,0,0,0,188.0,30,509,434,12.0,2/20,2/20,36.16,5.11,42.4,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,129.0,,1737,1004,22,4/82,,45.63,3.46,78.9,,0,0,248.0,,842,716,24,3/19,3/19,29.83,5.10,35.0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshire's middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion.\n \nBut it is somewhat surprising that Ervine is playing cricket at all, as a freak accident in his early teens - he slipped and fell on a broken glass in his family's living room - required a three-hour reconstructive operation to his right hand. The injury had been so severe that amputation was considered an option in the initial diagnosis. Ervine's recovery from the injury focused his ambitions, and mid-way through his A level studies at Lomagundi College on the outskirts of Chinhoyi he won a place at the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy. Ervine soon found his way into the Midlands, and Zimbabwe Under-19 and A sides before heading to England to expand his horizons and improve his game.\n \nAfter spells with English clubs Bexhill and Lordhood, and a stint with Irish club Lisburn in Belfast, Ervine returned to Zimbabwe and took up a contract with Masvingo-based franchise Southern Rocks. Ervine was their leading run-scorer in the 2009-10 Logan Cup and topped their one-day averages as well. His returns in the domestic Twenty20 competition were more modest, but a call-up to Zimbabwe's squad for the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean followed. \n \nErvine's returns from Zimbabwe's trip to the Caribbean in early 2013 suggested a career heading in the right direction. He averaged 60.50 in the ODIs against West Indies, and was the leading run-scorer across all three formats on the tour. When Zimbabwe returned home, however, Ervine refused a paltry winter contract offer from ZC and instead left the country to play club cricket for Lisburn and Grade Cricket for Morley in Western Australia. It appeared another bright talent had been lost to Zimbabwean cricket, but after an 18-month break Ervine once again made himself available for Zimbabwe ahead of the 2014-15 season. The 2015 World Cup was surely a motivation for his move, and Ervine was included in Zimbabwe's squad for that tournament."", ' \n']",[],15.0,30,2,941.0,160,33.6,1925,48.88,2,3,113,6,15.0,0.0,84.0,81,11,2176.0,130*,31.08,2943,73.93,2,12,186,28,39.0,0.0,16.0,15,0,229.0,42,15.26,287,79.79,0,0,21,2,8.0,0.0,70.0,125,6,4813,215,40.44,,,10,25,,,63.0,0.0,159.0,150,28,4639,168*,38.02,,,8,25,,,67.0,0.0,56.0,50,9,1054,96,25.70,893,118.02,0,6,95,31,26.0,0.0,15.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,84.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,16.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,70.0,,210,143,3,2/44,,47.66,4.08,70.0,0,0,0,159.0,,158,125,1,1/25,1/25,125.00,4.74,158.0,0,0,0,56.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

But his international career hit the buffers when he joined the rebel strike in support of Heath Streak, and although all the players returned to work, Gripper was not among those reselected.

He won a one-day cap in England in 2004 - although there wasn't actually any play in the match, it counted as the toss was made - and was called up late to the Champions Trophy squad in September 2004 after Jermaine Lawson pulled out with a stress-fractured back. In July 2006, he was named as St Lucia's captain for West Indies' first-ever Twenty20 tournament and was recalled for the tour of England in 2007. After missing the first two Tests, Sammy was drafted into the side for his debut at Old Trafford, and celebrated with 7 for 66 in the second innings - a performance that included three wickets in a single over. St Lucian fans had their first opportunity to see Sammy in an ODI in his home country when he played at Gros Islet against Sri Lanka in 2008. "", ""In the next two years, Sammy struggled to hold down a place in the Test side while remaining a fairly permanent fixture in the one-day team. Playing for a weakened team against Bangladesh in 2009, he ended the two-Test series with 12 wickets. Further success with the ball came on Zimbabwe's tour of the Caribbean in 2010, as he became the first West Indian to take five wickets in a Twenty20 international. West Indies went on to lose that game, but Sammy's bowling in the one-day series which followed - he took eight wickets at 12.50 and an economy rate of just 2.85 - was a major factor in the home side's win. He was also one of the bright spots in West Indies' whitewashing by the South Africans later that year, although this time it was his batting that grabbed the attention: he scored his runs at a strike-rate of 145.31, and registered the fastest ever half-century by a West Indian in the second ODI at North Sound, very nearly snatching an unlikely win. "", ""After Chris Gayle did not sign a central contract in 2010, Sammy was named captain of the Test and one-day teams. He did lead West Indies to their first Test win in two years, taking seven wickets against Pakistan in Providence in 2011, but overall the results were disappointing. Though West Indies won six in a row - against New Zealand (at home), Bangladesh and Zimbabwe - they then lost heavily against India and New Zealand (away).

After retiring as a player he moved into coaching, taking charge of Sri Lanka in 2003. His appointment came as a surprise, given that he had little coaching experience at higher levels. However, the players warmed to his style, and in 2004 the team arrested a downward slide. His stint lasted nearly two years, before Tom Moody took over. In 2007, Dyson was interested in the India and Bangladesh vacancies, and he eventually edged out his fellow Australian Dav Whatmore for the post of West Indies coach. His tenure, as those before him will attest to, combined sporadic success with humiliating defeat, while the board continued to fight with and against the players' association.

Buttler has helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, whilst also reigniting his Test career after a surprise recall by new national selector Ed Smith. \n"", 'Softly-spoken and unassuming, with supple hands and a great eye, Buttler kills opposing attacks with kindness, with a graceful flip shot for six over long-on and the occasional resort to a nerveless ramp shot over the wicketkeeper among his most eye-catching shots in an inventive repertoire. Like his captain, Eoin Morgan, his unflustered response to even the most daunting run chase is one of his greatest assets, his steely resolve hidden beneath a benign exterior. Such was his impact for Mumbai Indians in his first appearance in IPL in 2016, capable of mayhem late in the innings, that for a young cricket follower in India with only Twenty20 in their heart, it was possible to imagine that England had rarely, if ever, produced a player of such star quality. ', ""Buttler was in the crowd at Taunton as a young spectator during the 1999 World Cup when India's Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid thrashed what was then the highest partnership in ODI cricket. He was hooked. Somerset gained special permission from the ECB to add him to their Academy at 12, two years early, and he came to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somerset's title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somerset's run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somerset's defeat to Surrey."", ""He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of England's T20 side. A first ODI appearance came against Pakistan in the UAE during the winter, though he had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper. When Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Craig Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India. With Kieswetter still preferred as Somerset's gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future."", ""England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's as he led a failed run chase virtually single-handed. When Matt Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble - what proved to be a career-ending injury - the selectors gambled by throwing Buttler into the Test team. He scored five half-centuries in his first eight Tests, including 85 on debut against India at the Ageas Bowl, but his form faltered and he lost the gloves to Jonny Bairstow on England's tour of the UAE in 2015-16, during a period where his keeping started to make necessary improvements but his batting slip away."", ""There were no such doubts about his place in the white-ball teams. His seniority was recognised when he was named Morgan's vice-captain for the 2015 World Cup and, although that tournament was an unhappy one for England, Buttler was a key member of the side that reached the final of the World T20 a year later. His dynamic batting was emblematic of England's one-day reinvention under Morgan, though he also began to demonstrate increased range to his game - when he led England to an extraordinary one-wicket win over Australia at Old Trafford in 2018, his unbeaten 110 from 122 balls was by far the slowest hundred of his career."", ""Amid increasing demand on the T20 circuit, which included spells in the Bangladesh Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, Buttler's Test star seemed to be waning. He was briefly recalled in India in 2016-17 but then spent more than a year on the fringes, and was even overlooked as Bairstow's back-up during the following winter's Ashes tour. However, his stellar form for Rajashtan Royals in the 2018 IPL - he equalled the league record for consecutive fifties - prompted Smith to pick up the phone. Impressive contributions against Pakistan followed, and then, at long last, a maiden Test hundred, recorded in defeat to India at Trent Bridge.

He broke into the England side in 1997 as a combative opener with a punchy cover-drive, a sure sense of his off stump, and a glaring weakness against spin. Given an extended run, he repaid the selectors with vital centuries in 1998 against the world's two best teams - South Africa at Headingley and Australia at Brisbane. In 1999, he even captained England in a Test against New Zealand. But the runs dried up in South Africa, his Surrey form crumbled, and so did his marriage, to\nAlec Stewart's sister Judy. Butcher lost his appetite for the game, and his Test place to Marcus Trescothick. His father, Alan, a one-Test wonder and respected coach, helped him rebuild his technique and he made an unexpected comeback as a Test No. 3 in 2001. His fighting qualities brought a string of useful scores, and then came nirvana: a blazing, take-no-prisoners 173 not out against Australia at Headingley, turning a stiff run-chase into a breeze. It was the innings of his life. On the flat pitches of 2002, he\nfinally achieved consistency, making 551 runs at 55 and maturely playing David Boon to Trescothick and Vaughan's Taylor and Slater. He also wrote and sang a touching ballad at the memorial service for his team-mate Ben Hollioake, entitled "", "". His old frailties resurfaced in the 2002-03 Ashes - running haplessly between the wickets and getting out when set - and carried over into the following year, when he was in arguably the form of his life. But he mounted a comeback in 2004, as England's highest scorer in their 3-0 Test series routing of West Indies in the Caribbean - where he made 296 runs in four matches, but a series of freak injuries the following summer brought to an end a run of 42 consecutive Test appearances, and left him once again on the periphery of the team. He reached 50 Tests, curiously, without playing in a single one-day international, and was appointed Surrey captain for the 2005 season, but broke his hand and was only able to take up the reins in the middle of August. Surrey were relegated soon afterwards and Butcher's injury problems intensified with a series of knee problems. After struggling to overcome them he retired during the 2009 season to bring an end to the Butcher-era at The Oval.\n"", ' August 2009 \n']",[],71.0,131,7,4288.0,173*,34.58,10005,42.85,8,23,559,3,61.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,280.0,478,39,17870,259,40.70,,,38,95,,,263.0,0.0,191.0,171,31,4460,139,31.85,,,2,28,,,63.0,0.0,13.0,12,0,210,60,17.50,162,129.62,0,2,30,2,4.0,0.0,71.0,30,901,541,15.0,4/42,5/68,36.06,3.60,60.0,2,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,280.0,,7703,4237,125,5/86,,33.89,3.30,61.6,,1,0,191.0,,2527,2210,49,3/23,3/23,45.10,5.24,51.5,0,0,0,13.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

A skiddy fast bowler, she represented Yorkshire at Under-15 and Under-17 level, but took a break from county cricket at the age of 17 because she was overweight and not really enjoying the game. \n"", ""But two years later - spurred on by her sister's dramatic weightloss - Brunt was back, leaner and meaner than ever. She moved up from Yorkshire to Super 4s to England as fast as her weight had dropped off - at lightning pace - and both transformations were down to sheer grit and application.\nSo dramatic was her weightloss after a vigorous dieting and exercise regime that some of her new England colleagues didn't recognise her when, aged 19, she turned up for the drawn Test against New Zealand in 2004."", 'A trip to South Africa for the 2005 World Cup followed, although it ended in disappointment for second-ranked England who were knocked out at the semi-final stage by the eventual winners Australia. But Brunt exacted revenge four months later, taking 14 wickets in the two Tests and scoring her first Test fifty besides as England romped to their first Ashes series win in 42 years.', ""A few months later she toured the subcontinent when England visited Sri Lanka and India at the end of 2005, with mixed success. Brunt's own tour ended early when she broke a finger and had to fly home."", 'In fact her career has been blighted by injuries throughout, in particular a troublesome back, which saw her miss the 2007-08 Ashes to recover from surgery. She reignited the injury out in Australia during the 2013-14 Ashes and seriously considered walking away from cricket altogether, but the ushering in of the professional era in May that year allowed her the time and support to fight her way back to full fitness and recover much of her old pace.', ""The recovery time has always proved worth it. A fully fit Brunt has been one of the most powerful weapons in England's armoury, since 2009 becoming England's leading strike bowler with a pace that - at her quickest - has rivalled the fastest in the women's game.

The improvement in her batting was also apparent in the 2015 Ashes series, when she top-scored with 39 for England in the first innings of the Canterbury Test.

Few visiting captains have been received with so much acclaim by the crowds of Melbourne and Sydney. Although England lost the series by four matches to one, it was soon appreciated that the 40-year-old Brown had almost single-handedly, and against every forecast, done a huge amount to revitalise English cricket, which had been humbled in turn by Australian speed and West Indian spin. What is in many ways a romantic story started when Brown was offered the captaincy of Northamptonshire early in 1949. He called his new charges back for three weeks training before the season began and went on to lead them to sixth place in the Championship--after two years at the bottom of the table. In addition, he was invited to captain England in the last two Tests against New Zealand and, crucially, a year later, the Gentleman at Lord's. A sudden first-innings collapse, the presence of the selectors, and his sense of the occasion put Brown on his mettle. In a wonderful innings of 122, made in 110 minutes, he hit a six and sixteen fours, scoring all but 9 of the runs put on while he was at the wicket. The selectors had no need to look further for the man they wanted in Australia, and he was recalled to lead England at the Oval in the last Test against West Indies. \n"", ""Indifferent form against the states did little to suggest that England would make a fight of it in the Tests; but they defied the critics by bowling out Australia for 228 on the opening day of the First Test at Brisbane. Although torrential overnight rain subsequently turned a losing score into a winning one, it was generally felt that England were superbly led and had played the better cricket. At Melbourne England lost by 28 runs: Brown's 62 in the first innings and four for 26 in Australia's second helped to make him the most popular player of the series. And so to Sydney, two down. Injuries to Bailey and Wright on the second day ruined the match as a contest, but made it memorable by compelling the feat of Bedser, Brown (bowling mostly seamers) and Warr, who sent down 123 eight-ball overs in scorching heat between 3.30 p.m. on the Saturday and lunch on Tuesday. When Brown's innings of 79 is taken into account, his contribution assumes heroic proportions. It is better to draw a veil over Adelaide, apart from Hutton's 156 not out, and go on to Melbourne, with England four down and thoroughly dejected. The captain, however, sounded the rallying call and seized the initiative by taking five of Australia's first-innings wickets after the home team had won the toss on the first morning. After that, victory by eight wickets was left in the capable hands of Hutton and Simpson. The whole picture had changed and spirits were high once more. As a postscript to Brown's main achievement, there was an immediate victory over New Zealand in Wellington, a 3-1 series win against South Africa at home in 1951, and a solitary appearance at Lord's in 1953 against Australia, at the special request of his fellow-selectors. It should also be noted that the youthful Brown had played in five Tests against New Zealand in three separate series before the war and in one against India in 1932 at Lord's."", "" Brown's career fell into two distinct halves. When he took over at Northampton in 1949 he had had virtually no first-class cricket for nine years, but by 1953, when he finally called it a day in county cricket, he had made 4,331 runs for them and taken 391 wickets. Before the war, he played for Surrey from 1931 to 1939, and although available for less than half their matches he delighted Oval regulars with his refreshing energy and enthusiasm. He greatly enjoyed the captaincy and the company of Percy Fender, Errol Holmes and Monty Garland-Wells in those years, and from Fender he learned that there was pace enough in the pre-war Oval pitches to reward top-class leg-spin. He had his best and most spectacular season in 1932, and events at The Oval in early August highlight the damage he was liable to inflict on suffering bowlers. Middlesex, having won the toss, collapsed for 141, and in reply Surrey were 195 for five. At this point Brown, in a glorious display of fearless hitting, made 212 in 200 minutes, hitting seven sixes (two out of the ground) and fifteen fours. Kent and Middlesex (at Lord's in the return match) felt the full force of his explosive power before the season was over, and his double of 1,135 runs and 120 wickets was rewarded with a place on the boat to Australia with Jardine's side. He was one of the Five Cricketers of the Year in the 1933"", '.', "" Freddie Brown was born at Lima, Peru, where his father, no mean cricketer himself, was in business. The boy's left-handedness at everything met with paternal disapproval, and he was forced to change over, fortunately with no damage to his natural co-ordination. At his prep school, St Pirans, he made rapid strides under the tutorage of Aubrey Faulkner, who on the staff, so that when he moved on to The Leys, he had four years of unbroken success, with more than 2,000 runs and nearly 200 wickets for XI. Before his first season at Cambridge, he was advised by Faulkner to concentrate on leg-breaks and googlies as his main weapons in first-class cricket, keeping his medium-pace swingers up his sleeve as a variation. That he was able to carry this out is a tribute to his adaptability. In his two seasons at Cambridge, 1930 and 1931, he exceeded 1,000 runs in 25 matches and took exactly 100 wickets. In his first University Match he played two useful innings, and in 1931, when the Nawab of Pataudi made his record 238 not out for Oxford, he sustained and accurate and probing attack with five for 153 in 43.5 overs."", 'In an appendix to his book, ', ', published in 1954, no fewer than 27 instances of fast scoring involving brown are cited, and it is estimated that he scored at 64 runs per hour in his longer innings, usually with shirt billowing and with a white kerchief ever present. In a career stretching from 1930 to 1961, he made 13,325 runs at 27.36, including 22 hundreds, took 1,221 wickets at 26.21 apiece, and held 212 catches. He performed the double again in 1949, and in 1952 he missed a third by a single wicket. He passed 1,000 runs four times. His best bowling figures were eight for 34 against Somerset at Weston-super-Mare in 1939. In his 22 Tests, 15 as captain, Brown made 734 runs for an average of 25.31 and took 45 wickets at 31.06. He was chairman of selectors in 1953, and later in the decade he managed the MCC sides in South Africa and Australia. He was President of MCC in 1971-72 and also of the NCA and ESCA.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1933'],22.0,30,1,734.0,79,25.31,,,0,5,,5,22.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,335.0,536,49,13325,212,27.36,,,22,56,,,212.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22.0,31,3260,1398,45.0,5/49,6/81,31.06,2.57,72.4,3,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,335.0,,65967,32007,1221,8/34,,26.21,2.91,54.0,,62,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

His new-ball partnership with James Anderson has sustained England's Test attack for years, his own aggression and ability to flog bounce from all but the most benign surface dovetailing nicely with Anderson's technical excellence. And as Anderson continued to set new landmarks, Broad followed ably in his slipstream, emulating his friend when becoming only the second Englishman to take 400 Test wickets. \n"", ""Broad has been blessed with one remarkable career performance. However long he plays, surely nothing will come close to the first session of the Ashes Test of 2015, on his home ground of Trent Bridge, when he took 8 for 15 as Australia were bowled out before lunch, in only 18.3 overs, for 60. This was Australia's ultimate humiliation - a beating as raw and ridiculed as the 5-0 larruping from 18 months earlier that England were on their way avenging. Broad's incredulous hands-to-mouth expression as Ben Stokes plucked a catch at fifth slip became the picture of the summer."", 'Broad has always been a bowler capable of a hot streak. On the occasion of his 100th Test in November 2016, he had taken five wickets in a single spell seven times. On such occasions, he runs in hard and his menace visibly grows. His combative fast bowling and volatile temperament (comparisons have been made with Draco Malfoy, a Harry Potter baddie) has been one of his great strengths as well as periodically bringing criticism about his behaviour, but the respect in which he is held was amplified when England recognised his desire to succeed and ability to think on his feet by appointing him as Twenty20 captain. He led the side on 27 occasions between 2011-15 before England, with an eye to the preservation of a vital player, utilised him increasingly as a Test specialist.', 'Despite being carted for six sixes in an over by Yuvraj Singh at the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007, his stock continued to rise on tour with England in Sri Lanka when his 11 cheap wickets helped them to a 3-2 one-day series victory. He was then called up for the subsequent Test series, making his debut on a slab of Colombo concrete and toiling for 36 sweaty overs. The subsequent tour of New Zealand proved to be his real chance, however. With Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison both lacking form, he was selected for the Wellington Test. The decision taken by his coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan was soon vindicated.  ', 'Broad was already shaping up as the Next Big Thing of English cricket when he pushed his career into overdrive in a sensational spell of bowling in the fifth and decisive Ashes Test at The Oval in 2009. With the series in the balance, Broad claimed figures of 5 for 37 in 12 overs, including 4 for 8 in 21 balls, and after that there was no coming back for Australia.', 'He was struck by injury for the first time in the 2010-11 winter, ruled out of the last three Ashes Tests before breaking down again during the World Cup. However, his significance in England\'s future was confirmed when he was named Twenty20 captain. A slump in form almost cost him his Test place for the visit of India - a period when he was misguidedly imagined in the ""enforcer"" role - but, having survived the cut, he responded with a Man-of-the-Series display, including the first Test match hat-trick to be recorded at Trent Bridge, in a spell of 5 for 5: another trademark burst.', ""Broad's form with the ball was one of the few positives as England suffered a 3-0 whitewash against Pakistan in February 2012 and he began the domestic Test season in splendid form, against West Indies at Lord's, taking 7 for 72 in the first innings, which made him only the eighth player to earn the distinction of being on two honours boards at the home of cricket. His four in the second innings made him the first England bowler to take 10 wickets or more in a match there since Ian Botham in 1978."", 'His subsequent form was less impressive, however. Concerns that he was dropping in pace were alleviated by eight wickets against South Africa at Headingley, but he lost his place on the tour of India, after struggling with a heel injury and failing to take a wicket in either of the first two Tests. But after being fitted with specially designed boots, he showed signs of improvement.', ""That recovery was confirmed against New Zealand at Lord's, as he ripped out 7 for 44 - his best Test figures - and he then almost single-handedly won the Durham Test against Australia with another 11-wicket haul (six in one inspired spell), as England secured their third Ashes series in a row. There was a six-for in the first innings at Brisbane, as England began the return tour in 2013-14 well enough - only to end up being whitewashed for the third time in Ashes history."", 'Broad\'s growing maturity was never more evident. He went to Australia as a marked man, after his butter-wouldn\'t-melt failure to walk at Trent Bridge the previous summer, his nick against Ashton Agar looking all the worse because the ball cannoned off the gloves of wicketkeeper Brad Haddin to first slip. Broad had to withstand a self-righteous debate about ""walking"", a practice which had largely died out for half a century, and he was roundly booed by Australian crowds throughout the winter, but he softened their hostility by good-naturedly soaking up all they threw at him, as well as producing some of England\'s best spells, and emerging as their leading wicket-taker, on a forgettable tour.', ""He was too hostile for India again at Old Trafford in 2014, returned his Ashes eight-for the following year, then treated South Africa to a concerted assault in Johannesburg in 2015-16. Broad's latest five-wicket spell was his first overseas and brought a decisive end to South Africa's proud stint as the world No.1 Test side. When he claimed his 400th Test wicket in Auckland in 2018, he was the youngest man to reach the mark."", ""His batting has flattered to deceive. In 2008, no less a technical purist than Geoffrey Boycott likened his tall elegant batting style to Sir Garfield Sobers, but predictions that he would develop into a fully-fledged allrounder did not come to pass. Nevertheless, he has a remarkable Test hundred against his name, his stand-and-deliver assault on the Pakistan attack at Lord's in 2010, from 102 for 7, bringing him 169 - the highest score by an England No. 9. The Test was later sullied by revelations that Pakistan had bowled deliberate no-balls, bringing lengthy bans for three of their players."", 'In his early cricketing career, Broad played as an opening batsman, following the example of his father, Chris, until he suddenly shot up.

His occasional gracelessness was the flip-side of his impressive determination, and in 1983 he left his home-town club Gloucestershire for Nottinghamshire, whingeing that their unambitiousness had held him back. England rewarded this theoretically  frowned-on move by picking him at once. This paid off spectacularly  against the weak Australian team of 1986-87 when Broad equalled Jack  Hobbs and Wally Hammond by scoring centuries in three successive  Tests of an Ashes series.  He scored a further 139 in the dreary Sydney bicentenary Test a year  later but smashed the stumps down after being bowled. And when he  was seen mouthing off after being given lbw at Lord's, he was dropped -  ostensibly for loss of form, but the England management was getting  increasingly tough-minded after the free-for-all of the Ian Botham era,  and petulance was out of fashion: Broad only ever played two more  Tests. Later, he became more serene but less effective, returning in peace to Gloucestershire and then joining the BBC TV commentary team before it was disbanded. His commentary was as well-honed as his batting, though his flair for it was less obvious.

The last reports as to the condition of Briggs's health had been so discouraging that the news of his death did not cause much surprise. Though he rallied so wonderfully from his seizure at Leeds, during the Test match in 1899, as to bowl with nearly all his old skill and success throughout the season of 1900, it was known that his ailment -- a form of epilepsy -- admitted of no permanent cure, and was liable to recur at any time. He had another attack sooner than had been expected; was compelled to go back to Cheadle Asylum; and took no part in the cricket of 1901. Five or six weeks before his death it was announced that he had again rallied after a serious relapse, but this time the improvement was of very brief duration. Briggs had a long career, but at the time of his death he was only a little over thirty-nine. Like so many other famous professional cricketers, he was a  Nottingham man, being born at Sutton-in-Ashfield, on October 3rd, 1862. While still a child, however, he went to live in Lancashire, and all his cricket was learnt in the county for which, during more than twenty years, he did such brilliant work. He must have shown great promise while very young, as he was given a trial in the Lancashire eleven before he was seventeen. He played in five matches for the county in 1879, and though he met with little success his aptitude for the game was so obvious that no doubt was felt as to his future. In those early days he was played chiefly for his fielding, his quickness and energy making him from the first a special favourite with the crowds at Old Trafford. The popularity that he thus gained as a lad remained with him to the end, and wherever he went the public took the keenest interest in his doings. For two or three seasons he was not much more than a splendid field, but from 1883 his batting rapidly improved, and a little later, without much warning, he blossomed out as one of the great slow bowlers of his day. In 1885 he headed the bowling averages for Lancashire, with seventy-nine wickets for 10½ runs each, but, though this was a very fine record, his fame as a bowler really dated from the England and  Australia match, at Lord's, in 1886 -- the memorable game in which Shrewsbury played his innings of 164. The opening day's cricket was interfered with by rain, and the England eleven, who had won the toss, did not finish their innings till the second day, their total being 353. When the  Australians went in against this formidable number, Jones and Scott scored so freely that an even match seemed in prospect. Suddenly, however, the character of the cricket underwent a complete change. Mr. A. G. Steel, who captained England, put Briggs on as first change, and the Australians, though their score stood at 45 when the first wicket went down, were all out all for 121, Briggs bowling 34 overs, 22 maidens, for 29 runs and 5 wickets. His success caused great surprise, as he had played for  England a fortnight before at Manchester without being called upon to bowl at all. When the Australians followed on, he took six wickets for 45 runs, and England won the match in a single innings. Thenceforward, Briggs's reputation as a left-handed slow bowler was firmly established and, as everyone knows, he remained in the front rank, with, of course, the fluctuations of fortune to which all cricketers are subject, till his unhappy seizure at Leeds in 1899."", ""He jumped to the top of the tree at a very opportune moment in 1886 -- Peate being then almost done with -- and for many seasons his only rival in his own particular style was Peel. There is no need to go into details of his work year by year, but it is interesting to note that, according to the figures given in Bat v. Ball, he took in first-class matches, from 1885 to 1899 inclusive, 2034 wickets for less than 16 runs each. He had a bad season in 1898, but in 1900, after his first illness, he came out again in such form that 127 wickets fell to him for something over 17½ runs each. During all his years of success Briggs was much more than a mere bowler. He was always a dangerous bat, likely at any time to get his fifty runs, and in the field he retained all the energy and nearly all the speed of his young days. Though the greater part of this work was done for Lancashire, he was in the truest sense of the word a representative cricketer, being picked over and over again for England and the Players, and being nearly as well known on Australian grounds as in this country. He paid six visits to the Colonies, going out with Shaw and Shrewbury's teams in 1884-85, 1886-87, and 1887-88; with Lord Sheffield's team in 1891-92, and with Mr.  Stoddart's elevens in  1894-95, and 1897-98. As it happened, he went once too often, proving a sad failure for Stoddart's second team. In the other trips, however, he did himself full justice. Among all his Australian experiences the most remarkable was the famous 10 runs win at Sydney, in December, 1894, when Australia suffered defeat after playing a first innings of 586. The Australians only had to get 177 in the last innings, and at the close of the fifth day they had scored 113, with two men out. After drenching rain in the night, however, Peel and Briggs secured the eight outstanding wickets for 53 runs, gaining for  Stoddart's side perhaps the most sensational victory in the history of cricket. Briggs, as a slow bowler, had nearly every good quality. His beautifully easy action enabled him to stand any amount of work; he had plenty of spin, and no one was more skilful in tempting batsmen to hit on the off-side. For a few seasons he bowled a particularly good fast ball, but in this respect he fell off in later years.""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1889'],33.0,50,5,815.0,121,18.11,,,1,2,,0,12.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,535.0,826,55,14092,186,18.27,,,10,58,,,258.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33.0,49,5332,2095,118.0,8/11,15/28,17.75,2.35,45.1,4,9,4,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,535.0,,100144,35430,2221,10/55,,15.95,2.12,45.0,,200,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Strong-willed, independent and with an understated sense of humour, he perfectly captured the stereotype of the self-made Yorkshire sportsman. ""A doer more than a thinker"" he once said about himself, but he was sharp-witted on and off the field, had an impressive hold on reality and a healthy suspicion of fads and fancies \n', ""A powerfully built allrounder, Bresnan had been tipped for higher honours since he became the youngest player in 20 years to represent Yorkshire when he debuted in 2001. It was nearly a decade later that he really announced his arrival in the big-time, however, with a phenomenal performance in the fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne in December 2010. Called into the side as a replacement for Steven Finn, and with a remit to keep the runs down, he starred with a performance of skill, pace and unrelenting accuracy. First, he played a key role in bowling Australia out for 98 in the first innings, then he sealed England's successful defence of the Ashes with 4 for 50 in the second innings."", ""Such was his understated value to the side that England won the first 13 Tests he played in - a record bettered only by Adam Glichrist. At that point, having taken eight wickets against West Indies at Trent Bridge, Bresnan averaged 40 with the bat and 25 with the ball but the lingering effects of an elbow injury that required surgery in late 2011 were about to take their toll. He claimed only five wickets in his next five Tests - and two in four against South Africa and India - before undergoing another operation at the start of 2013. He returned to the ODI team for their run to the Champions Trophy final and then picked up four wickets in England's crushing Ashes win at Lord's but his utility had been diminished and he became a victim of England's subsequent Ashes whitewash in Australia, his career limited after that to limited-overs formats."", ""Bresnan began his international career in the England Under-19 set-up and was part of the team in 2002 and 2003 - playing in two World Cups - the same years that he won the NBC Denis Compton Award for most promising Yorkshire player. All the potential took a few years to develop, but 2005 was an important year for him as he was given more responsibility in a transitional Yorkshire team. He was surprisingly overlooked for the England Academy, but started 2006 with a string of impressive performances with bat and ball, leading to a call-up to England's new-look one-day squad to face Sri Lanka. However, he fell victim to the flashing blades of Jayasuriya and co., then suffered injury in the second half of the season as he lost his place for the series against Pakistan."", ""A better all-round summer in 2008 helped him catch the selectors' eyes again, however, and he was called up late in the season for the one-day squad. But after a winter without any honours it appeared he would have to bide his time again before he was surprisingly named in the Test squad to face West Indies. He duly played in both matches, but such was England's dominance it wasn't until the final day of the series that he finally made his mark. He claimed his maiden Test wicket in the second innings and eventual figures of 3 for 45, as West Indies slumped to an innings defeat."", ""While he hovered around the fringes of the Test side thereafter injuries during England's tour to Bangladesh in 2010 opened the door and he impressed, showing good discipline and stamina in trying conditions. He then played an important role in delivering England the 2010 World Twenty20, showing skill and an unfailing ability to hit his straps early to give England control with the new ball, before returning at the end of the innings with steely death-bowling. "", ""Injuries than began to hamper him. A second operation on a troublesome right elbow caused him to miss the 2013 tour to New Zealand. He returned to England's colours adamant that his pace, which he admitted had been reduced because of the injury, had been restored, but it was hard to accept the claim as he struggled like many of his colleagues during England's 5-0 whitewash in Australia in 2013/14. He did not represent England in Tests the following summer. His zip had gone, however, later evidenced by a third elbow operation after the 2016 season. But he committed himself instead to back-to-back Yorkshire Championship wins were his down-to-earth approach, on and off the field, remained highly prized. "", ""An unbeaten hundred against Somerset was his first since 2007 and an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 366 with Jonny Bairstow against Durham at Chester-le-Street - both batsmen making career-best scores - emphasised Yorkshire's might. It was a record stand against Durham, the third-highest seventh-wicket stand in the history of first-class cricket and it is the fifth-highest for Yorkshire, the other four all being opening partnerships. But it was his redoubtable efforts in 2016 that won Yorkshire hearts as much as ever before: Yorkshire conceded the chance of a hat-trick of Championship titles on the final evening of the season, at Lord's, against the side that took their crown, Middlesex, but Bresnan's defiant, unbeaten 142 ensured they did not concede it without a fight in an innings that would enter Yorkshire folklore. "", 'His career-best figures in any format came on an extraordinary, wet night at Headingley when he returned 6 for 19 before a sold-out Roses T20 crowd. Four wickets came in his last over, three to Bresnan plus a run-out that he made off his own bowling, enough to tempt him into a knee slide across the outfield in the pouring rain.

His bowling successes included ten Yorkshire wickets at Taunton, eleven Kent wickets at Catford -- five for 23 runs in the first innings -- and seven Gloucestershire wickets for 70 in the second innings at Bristol. In a memorable match at Leeds, 222 of 238 arrears were hit off by L. C. H. Palairet and Braund before a wicket fell and the Somerset total reached 630.  Palairet made 173, Braund 107 and F. A. Phillips 122. Then  Yorkshire, set to make 393, failed so completely that they were all out for 113, suffering by 279 runs their only Championship defeat of the summer. Sharing the bowling honours with B. Cranfield, Braund took four wickets for 41.', "" Braund played for Somerset until 1920, six times registering over 1,000 runs in a season and four times taking more than 100 wickets. On three occasions, from 1901 to 1903, he achieved the cricketers' double. His bowling record in 1902 was 172 wickets for less than 20 runs each and in the following year 134 for just over 21 runs apiece, and each season he exceeded 1,400 runs. Altogether during his career he made 17,801 runs, average 25.61, took 1,101 wickets, average 27.45, and held no fewer than 508 catches."", ""His slip-catching was phenomenal. In the  1901 Gentlemen v. Players match at Lord's he dismissed C. B. Fry with the catch of the season and in the 1902 Test match at Birmingham he disposed of Clem Hill with a long talked-about effort which helped Rhodes and George Hirst dispose of Australia for 36 -- the smallest total for which they have been dismissed in a Test. Anticipating a leg-glance by the left-handed Hill off Hirst, the fast left-arm bowler, Braund darted across from slip to the leg-side and held an amazing catch. Braund played in all that series of five Test matches. At Manchester he joined F. S. Jackson when five wickets were down for 44 and shared in a partnership of 141, of which his share was 65. Wonderful bowling by W. H. Lockwood subsequently left England on the second evening with victory in sight, but following a heavy fall of rain during the night Australia snatched a win by three runs. Had F. W. Tate caught J. Darling, whose 37 was top score in a  second innings total of 86, off Braund, the result must have been different, for four wickets would have been down for 16. By holding two catches at slip off  S. F. Barnes, Braund was responsible for Darling getting a pair in the Test at Sheffield."", ""With the teams led by A. C. MacLaren in 1901-02, P. F. Warner in 1903-04 and A. O. Jones in 1907-08, Braund went to Australia three times and on his first visit, when he made 103 not out at  Adelaide, his batting average for the Test matches was 36 and he took twenty-one wickets. During the next tour he scored 102 at Sydney when R. E. Foster, with 287, created a record, but on his third trip he fared moderately. Against the famous South African attack of 1907, Braund hit 104 at  Lord's, this being one of the two centuries obtained in Test matches against the bowling combination which included Aubrey Faulkner, R. O. Schwarz, A. E. Vogler and Gordon White."", ""After giving up active cricket, Braund became a first-class umpire, discharging his duties with marked ability until the end of the 1938 season. In 1943 it became necessary for his right leg to be amputated and three years later he lost the other, but his cheerfulness and his enthusiasm for cricket remained undiminished and for some years he watched cricket at Lord's seated in a bath chair. He was one of the twenty-six retired professional cricketers who in 1949 were given honorary membership of  M.C.C."", 'C. B. Fry, the former England captain, said of Braund: He was one of the greatest all-round cricketers -- and to think that Surrey let him go! The thing about Len Braund was that he was a big-match player. I have never seen a better slip fieldsman. He had such a delicate hand. He would push it out and the ball would stick. Archie MacLaren would never take the field without him. He was a most valuable member of the England team and as cool as a cucumber.', 'C. T. Bennett, captain of the 1925 Cambridge University team described by Sydney H. Pardon, then Editor of ', "", as probably the best sent up to Lord's by either University since the war, said:   Braund was the greatest gentleman in cricket, either amateur or professional, I ever met. His coaching made the 1925 side, four of whom played for the Gentlemen at Lord's that year, and K. S. Duleepsinhji would be the first to admit that he owed him a lot.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1902'],23.0,41,3,987.0,104,25.97,,,3,2,,2,39.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,432.0,752,57,17801,257*,25.61,,,25,75,,,546.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.0,38,3805,1810,47.0,8/81,9/87,38.51,2.85,80.9,1,3,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,432.0,,53709,30398,1114,9/41,,27.28,3.39,48.2,,80,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

The features of his forward stroke were the distance he thrust forward behind a big left pad, how low his head was as he searched for signs of movement from the ball, and its balance and compactness. Add a sharp-edged thigh-pad protecting the top of his leg and there wasn't a chink of daylight to be seen. If he hadn't made himself unavailable for 30 Tests in his prime - because, it was thought he felt that he, rather than Mike Denness, should have succeeded Ray Illingworth as captain - he would surely have become the first Englishman to make 10,000 Test runs. He returned triumphantly in 1977, scoring a century in his comeback Test and another - his 100th in first-class cricket - in front of his adoring home crowd at Headingley. As opener he saw his first task as scoring heavily enough to protect his teams against defeat, and in Test cricket and the County Championship - the matches that counted in the first-class averages - he was as sparing with the attacking strokes as, in retirement, he is strident in his opinions on the game. How valuable he was to England is shown by the fact that only 20 of his 108 Tests ended in defeat, mainly when he failed. His most productive strokes, off the back foot through the covers (his speciality) and the on-drive, were majestic in their power and placement. But he was not the man to press home an advantage. A loner, and an insatiable net-player, he was short of friends inside the game; indeed there were many who heartily disliked him because of his self-centredness. But he had charm, and responded warmly to those who offered friendship. After his retirement he became a trenchant commentator.

6 ft 3 in ",,,Right-hand bat,"Right-arm fast-medium, Right-arm medium",,,,"['\n', '\nWilliam Eric ""Bill"" Bowes, who died in hospital on September 5, 1987, aged 79, was one of the great bowlers of his day. He is often, for convenience, loosely classed as fast, but Robertson-Glasgow, writing in the early days of the war, described him, correctly, as the most difficult fast-medium bowler in England. It was, no doubt, partly because he never tried to acquire the extra yard or two of pace which would have put him indisputably in the ranks of the fast that he was such a fine bowler. And like most of the great, he came off the pitch faster than the batsman expected. \n', ""No man has ever worked harder at his art. He was constantly practising, constantly experimenting, but throughout he remained content with the ten yards to which that great coach, Walter Brearley, had cut his run when he first went to Lord's. He concentrated on control of length and direction and on moving the ball. He could always bowl a late in-swinger, but Brearley told him that he would never reach the top class unless he could make the ball run away as well. This it would occasionally do by a fluke, as at the Scarborough Festival in 1929, for example. George Hirst was persuaded to play and Bowes bowled him with one that pitched on the leg stump and took the off bail. Hirst, typically, said: Well bowled. That would have been too good for me when I was good. Yet by the middle of 1931, after three years of trying, Bowes was no nearer to discovering how to produce this ball. Meanwhile he was already on the fringe of the England side. Most men in this position would have been satisfied, and concluded that away-swingers were not for them. Not so Bowes; he went on trying and finally found the required hint in an obscure coaching manual, which told him it was all in the position of the feet at the moment of delivery. Within a week or two he was bowling away-swingers as easily as in-swingers, with a barely perceptible change of action. Thenceforward the batsman who had successfully cut two or three in-swingers, and tried to repeat the stroke, was liable to find that he had picked the wrong ball and to chop it into his stumps. That season his wickets cost him 4 runs apiece fewer than in 1930."", "" Yorkshire had in those days no nursery; players were picked from the nets and graduated through the Second XI. Bowes, wanting a secure tenure, applied with typical enterprise, and with the approval of the county authorities, for a place on the groundstaff at Lord's. He was taken on for 1928, and in his first first-class match for MCC he took five for 69 against Wales; in his second, against Cambridge, he did the hat-trick. Naturally Yorkshire became interested, and after some complex negotiations it was agreed that, while his contract with MCC should stand, he should be released to play for Yorkshire unless MCC required him for a first-class match. As a result he played a few times for the county in 1929 and did enough to show his possibilities, his figures for all first-class matches being 65 wickets at 19 each. In 1930, after several successful matches for Yorkshire, culminating in eight for 69 against Middlesex at Sheffield, he received his county cap. From then on, though his contract with MCC did not end till 1937, they claimed his services only on special occasions and he was a regular member of the county side."", ""There can be no doubt that his engagement at Lord's had been an advantage to him. Not only had he received much admirable advice and coaching, but he had been carefully nursed and saved from the grind of bowling six days a week in county cricket before he was strong enough, something which has ruined so many promising bowlers. Now that he was a recognised member of the Yorkshire side, he was taken in hand by the senior professionals and taught his trade with a thoroughness which does much to explain why for so many years the county was by and large the most formidable in the Championship. Night after night he and Verity, who started at the same time, were taken up to a hotel bedroom and the day's cricket was discussed, the field set out on the bed with toothbrushes, shaving tackle and the like, and praise and blame administered impartially as required. At one of the first of these sessions Verity, who had accomplished his biggest performance to date, seven for 26 against Hampshire, was greeted with, Seven for 26 and it ought to have been seven for 22! I never saw such bowling. Whatever wast thou doing to give A. K. Judd that four? There is precedent for this attitude. In 1918 Eton dismissed Charterhouse for 13. That great man, C. M. Wells, for many years in charge of Eton cricket, entered the dressing-room with the words, Should have been 9. But however outspoken the Yorkshire professionals were about anything of which they disapproved, there was no lack of praise either. Who could fail to learn in such an atmosphere? There can never have been a greater cricket school than the Yorkshire sides between the wars or two apter pupils than Bowes and Verity. And strong though Yorkshire were in every department, it was the bowling of these two more than anything else that won them their Championships in the 1930s."", ""There has probably never been a great cricketer who looked less like one than Bowes. Standing 6ft 4in, he was clumsily built and a poor mover. Wearing strong spectacles, he looked far more like a university professor, and indeed batted and fielded like one. However, no side has been so closely welded as Yorkshire in the 1920s and 1930s: every man knew just what he was expected to do and did it without being told. When Bowes suggested that it might be a good thing if he were taught the rudiments of batting, he was told firmly that his job was to take wickets; he was not to waste his valuable strength on making runs. If he ever showed signs of forgetting this, his partners were expected to run him out. Similarly in the field. He was stationed at mid-on and, if the ball came to him, he was to catch it or stop it as the case might be. But if it passed him, he was not to move; it was someone else's duty to chase it and throw it in. This was fully understood on the Yorkshire side. After all, Bowes was their great opener and they had no alternative to him."", 'But England had Larwood (and later Farnes), Voce and Allen, all faster than Bowes and all but Farnes far better bats and fields. Besides them there was always Hammond, a much better bowler than was generally realised, to open if required. In those days three quick bowlers were usually regarded as ample; a place had to be kept for a slow left-arm bowler and a leg-spinner, if a good enough one could be found. So it is not surprising that selectors often passed Bowes over. Tests against Australia then stood on a footing of their own. Between 1932 and 1939, England played twenty Tests against Australia and Bowes was picked for six only; but as in these he took, in an era of mammoth scoring, 30 wickets at 24.70, it was clear that he was in no way out of his class. Yet even for the 1932-33 tour of Australia, his one tour abroad, he received his invitation only three days before the team sailed, having forced himself into the side by some superb bowling in the last weeks of the season.', 'One wicket on that tour in particular is remembered and deserves description. At Melbourne in the Second Test, Bradman, who had missed the First Test, came in to such tumultuous applause that Bowes had to stop in the middle of his run for it to subside, and to fill in time he moved mid-on to silly mid-on. Again he started, again he had to stop, and this time he moved his deep fine leg. He noticed that Bradman followed these moves with grave attention, and he felt sure that he expected a bouncer. So he ran up with his most threatening expression, but instead of digging the ball in he deliberately bowled one little more than stump high. Bradman, already halfway in position to hook, had suddenly to alter his stroke and in so doing pulled the ball into his wicket. In other words, a great piece of bowling. In fact, although with his height Bowes naturally had a steeper rise than most bowlers, and was always prepared to bowl a bouncer, he did not rely on it as a regular form of attack and, as he gained in experience, used it less and less. His use of the bouncer has probably been exaggerated by a famous incident at The Oval is 1932, a month or so before the start of this tour, when he bounced some at Hobbs. On that occasion, as far as the two protagonists were concerned there was no lasting ill feeling, though Hobbs never approved of the bodyline tactics.', ""Getting a commission in the war, Bowes was captured at Tobruk in 1942 and spent three years as a prisoner. By the time he returned home, he had lost four and a half stone and was not really fit to stand the rigours of first-class cricket. Moreover, at 38 he had reached an age which a bowler of his type is sure to have lost some of his fire. His troubles were compounded by a severe strain to the muscles of his side and back. None the less, bowling at a reduced pace, he struggled bravely through two seasons, still taking wickets cheaply for the county and even playing against India at Lord's. In 1947 his benefit brought him £8,000, at that time a record, and he decided to retire, though Yorkshire were anxious to retain him even if he could bowl only off-spinners. Fortunately he had still 40 years of service to cricket in front of him. To the day of his death he wrote regularly on cricket for the papers, and with his profound knowledge of the game every word he wrote was worth reading. His autobiography, "", "", published in 1949, is probably the best book on cricket ever written by a professional; certainly the best since Albert Knight's "", ' eighty years ago.', 'In his first-class career of 372 games, Bowes took 1,639 wickets at 16.76: as he made only 1,530 runs, his wickets outnumber his runs.

A fortnight later at the World Cup in the Caribbean, he showed impressive resolve and class in his maiden one-day fifty against Sri Lanka, albeit in a losing cause. He was one of only a handful of England players to emerge from that tournament with their reputation enhanced, but injury prevented him from building on his success at the inaugural World Twenty20.', 'Three consecutive hundreds against West Indies in early 2009 rebalanced his ledger, only for a difficult Ashes experience to again cost him his place, and he remained on the fringes of the Test side. His form in limited-overs cricket, where his medium-pace bowling is also a useful option, has been more consistent, with some of his most mature displays coming under the ODI captaincy of his Essex team-mate Alastair Cook.', ""Another encouraging display for England in their one-day series against Sri Lanka in October 2007 led to his call-up to the Test squad and he was picked to make his debut in the opening match at Kandy ahead of Owais Shah. It was, on reflection, a tour too soon for Bopara, who scratched 42 runs in three Tests, including three ducks in a row, and was axed the following January. But 14 months later, after flitting around the fringes of the ODI team, he seized his opportunity when Andrew Flintoff flew home from the Caribbean with a hip injury. Picked at No. 6 for the Barbados Test, he responded with a classy 104. Though omitted from the subsequent Test in Trinidad, to accommodate an extra bowler, he was recalled at No. 3 in the return series in England two months later and responded with hundreds in each of his next two innings, at Lord's and Chester-le-Street, to emulate the achievement of his mentor, Graham Gooch, in 1990."", ""A decent showing in the subsequent World Twenty20 confirmed Bopara's place for the Ashes series that got underway in July, but not everyone was impressed with his attitude. After mustering 105 runs in seven innings, he was dropped for the series decider at The Oval, where Jonathan Trott exceeded that tally in a single knock. Two years in the Test wilderness followed, as Eoin Morgan moved ahead of him in the selectors' thoughts, before a return as cover for the injured Trott in the third and fourth Tests against India. Bopara looked on from the sidelines in the UAE as England's batting failed disastrously against Pakistan in 2012 but first a side injury, in Sri Lanka, and then a thigh muscle tear ahead of West Indies' visit, barred him from another crack at Test cricket."", ""When it came, in the South Africa series after some impressive ODI innings against Australia, he quickly withdrew from the squad for personal reasons. He returned for World Twenty20 but still did not seem mentally attuned, as England meekly surrendered the title they won in 2010. His contribution in the 2013 Champions Trophy was more noteworthy, though he couldn't see England home in the final against India.

May 30, 1879, Deptford, Kent ","November 8, 1917, on the Forest Hall to Pimmern military railway line near Passchendaele, Belgium (aged 38 years 162 days) ",,"['England,', 'Kent']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Slow left-arm orthodox,,,,"['\nA great slow left-armer, possessing a classical delivery and looping flight. His action was elegant and smooth, a few strides leading into a perfect upright sideways-on delivery. He pitched the ball up to encourage the drive into a strong off-side field, and with sufficient spin to trap any batsman unwise enough to try and hit against it. He varied his pace well, and was deceptive through the air, with more pace than most batsmen realised until too late. \n', 'On the uncovered wickets before World War One, he was almost unplayable after rain, or when the pitch started to crumble. He relished the challenge of bowling to hard-hitting batsman, bringing to his art the virtue of considerable imagination - he seemed always to have something more up his sleeve. He debuted for Kent when 20 years old, and took over 100 wickets in his second season. ', 'He bowled little the following year, due to illness, but from 1902 to his final season in 1914 he took more than 10 wickets every year. His best year was 1909, when he took 215 wickets. In 1907 he took more wickets in a day than anyone else in first-class cricket history, following 10 for 30 (including 7 wickets for 1 run in 36 balls) with 7-18 against Northamptonshire. He toured Australia and South Africa twice, and America once, but in general found bowling overseas less to his taste than in English conditions. He was a fine violinist, and his artistic temperament, as well as his epilepsy did not always react well to the stress of Test matches. He died tragically young, killed in action at Passchendaele, and his memorial stands on the St. Lawrence Ground in Canterbury.\n', ""\nThe news that Blythe had been killed in France was received everywhere with the keenest regret. Inasmuch as Kenneth Hutchings had practically done with the game before joining the Army, the loss is the most serious that cricket has sustained during the war. It is true Blythe had announced his intention of playing no more in first-class matches, but quite possibly this decision was not final. He had certainly no need to think of retiring at the age of 38. That Blythe was a great bowler is beyond question. He had no warmer admirers than the many famous batsmen who had the satisfaction of making big scores against him. So far as I know they were unanimous in paying tribute to his remarkable powers. He was one of five left-handed slow bowlers of the first rank produced by England in the last forty years, the other four being Peate, Peel, Briggs, and Rhodes. To place the five in order of merit is a task I shall not attempt. The best experts, if asked to give an opinion on the point, would vary considerably in their views. For example, W. L. Murdoch thought Peate far ahead of either Peel or Briggs, whereas Arthur Shrewsbury found Peel harder to play than Peate, the fast ball that Peel had at command keeping him always on the alert. Again I have heard Ranjitsinhji say that he considered Blythe a finer bowler than Rhodes, the deceptive flight of the ball making him more difficult to hit. To these views I would only add that judging by the practical test of results a good case could be made out for Rhodes as the best bowler of the five--before he turned his mind to batting. The seasons in which he did such wonderful things for Yorkshire-- 1898 to 1901 inclusive--were seasons of fine weather and huge scoring. Peate's great deeds were done chiefly in summers of rain and bad weather."", ""Blythe had all the good gifts that pertain to the first-rate slow bowler, and a certain imaginative quality that was peculiarly his own. Very rarely did he get to the end of his resources. To see him bowl to a brilliant hitter was a sheer delight. So far from being disturbed by a drive to the ring he would, instead of shortening his length to escape punishment, send up the next ball to be hit, striving of course to put on, if possible, a little extra spin. In this respect he reminded me of David Buchanan in the Gentlemen and Players matches of long ago. Blythe's spin was something quite out of the ordinary. On a sticky wicket or on a dry pitch ever so little crumbled he came off the ground in a way that beat the strongest defence. He had, too, far more pace than most people supposed. The ball that went with his arm often approached the speed of a fast bowler and had of course the advantage of being unsuspected. On this point Fred Huish, the wicket-keeper, can be very illuminating."", ""Blythe was introduced to Kent cricket by Captain McCanlis, one of the best coaches the game has known. He was 20 years of age when he first played for Kent, and in 1900--his second season--he took 114 wickets in county matches alone. Illness during the winter affected his bowling in 1901, but after his visit to Australia with the team captained by A. C. MacLaren in 1901-2 he never looked back. His best season was 1909, when he took in first-class matches 215 wickets, at a cost of 14½ runs each. A list of Blythe's feats with the ball for Kent would fill a column. Against Northamptonshire, at Northampton, in 1907, he obtained seventeen wickets in one day, taking all ten in the first innings for 30 runs, and seven in the second for 18. Test matches, owing to his tendency to epileptic fits, were very trying to him, and after having had a big share in England's victory over Australia at Birmingham in 1909 he was practically forbidden to play at Lord's. Still he was, out by himself, England's best bowler in the three matches with the famous South African team of 1907, taking twenty-six wickets for less than 10½ runs a-piece. Only one of the three matches was finished, England winning at Leeds by 53 runs. Blythe on that occasion bowled himself to a standstill, but he had his reward, clearly winning the game for his country. Blythe's reputation will rest on his doings in England. His two visits to Australia scarcely added to his fame, and when he went to South Africa in 1905-6 and again in 1909-10, he did not find the matting wickets altogether to his liking. In the second of his South African tours he had a fairly good record, but as he was only picked for two of the five Test matches, he could not have been at his best. To sum up his career in a phrase, he will live in cricket history as the greatest Kent bowler of modern days. Nearly all his finest work was done for his county. It is pleasant to know that the Kent Committee have decided to put up a suitable memorial to him.-- S.H.P.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1904'],19.0,31,12,183.0,27,9.63,,,0,0,,0,6.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,439.0,587,137,4443,82*,9.87,,,0,5,,,206.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19.0,37,4546,1863,100.0,8/59,15/99,18.63,2.45,45.4,2,9,4,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,439.0,,103546,42094,2503,10/30,,16.81,2.43,41.3,,218,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He never quite achieved the greatness that some predicted for him as a teenager, but he was a very fine player at international level and English cricket lost a little grace when he played his last Test against Pakistan in Sharjah in November 2015. \n', 'Even after his international days were over, Bell retained that boyish image at the crease for Warwickshire that in the most physically-demanding periods often made him appear a slight and slightly vulnerable figure, but one unfurled cover drive later and his game could flow like few others. ', 'Once described by Dayle Hadlee as the best 16-year-old he had ever seen, Bell had been earmarked for greatness long before he was drafted onto the England tour of New Zealand in 2001-02, as cover for the injured Mark Butcher. He was immediately burdened with similar expectations when he made his England debut. His most fluent early efforts tended to come about when the pressure was off, a trait that belied an average above 40 and a record of a century every five or so Tests.', ""However, on the tour of South Africa in 2009-10, Bell set about changing those perceptions. A perfectly paced century while batting at No. 6 in Durban set England up for an innings victory that ranked, at the time, among their finest overseas performances for a generation, but he surpassed that effort in the very next Test in Cape Town, with a backs-to-the-wall 78 that saved the match and ensured a share of the series. On the subsequent tour of Australia, he continued to save his best for when the chips were down, particularly during England's first-innings struggles at Brisbane and Perth. He finished the tour on a high with his maiden Ashes hundred at Sydney, and a reputation transformed."", 'When in form, Bell was always been adept at leaving the ball outside off stump, and he received glowing reviews from coaches at every stage of his development, not least from Rod Marsh at the England Academy, a man not given to hyperbole. A former England U19 captain, Bell had played just 13 first-class games when called into the England squad, though in 2001 he scored 836 runs for Warwickshire at an average of over 64, including three centuries.', ""He didn't immediately translate that success and talent into runs at the international stage - he was found out by Australia's champions, McGrath and Warne, and mustered just 171 runs in ten innings - but he gradually found his feet and his form at the top level. In 2010 and 2011, he averaged more than 65 in five successive series, including the 2010-11 Ashes. But obviously that run wasn't going to last forever: he was brought back to earth by Pakistan's offspinner Saaed Ajmal in the three-Test series in 2012, managing only 51 runs in six innings."", ""The year was a largely forgettable one in Tests, for Bell and England, though pride was salvaged in India. A first series win in the country since 1984-85 was sealed in Nagpur, where Bell's second-innings hundred made certain of the requisite draw. A reminder of Bell's class came in 50-over cricket, where he made an immaculate transition to opener. That continued into 2013, with his third ODI hundred in lofty Dharamsala, although England were eventually thwarted in their attempts to win global silverware in the Champions Trophy final. He was a casualty of England's grim World Cup campaign in 2015, however, when he seemed unable to translate his talent into the bold stroke-play required and, having been dropped after the tournament, announced his retirement from the format later in the year."", ""His reputation for producing when England needed him in Test cricket, meanwhile, had been all but banished by a series-defining performance in the Ashes of 2013. Bell scored centuries in each of England's three victories, becoming the first man to reach triple figures in three successive Ashes Tests since Chris Broad in 1986 in the process. He was rewarded with the player of the series award and a place on the shortlist for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year."", 'He struggled to maintain his form in the return Ashes series in 2013-14 - he averaged just 26.11 compared to 62.44 in England - and then endured a run where he passed 1 only three times in 10 Test innings and averaged 26.87 in the 2015 Ashes. He was dropped from the ODI side after the 2015 World Cup and from the Test side after the year-end tour to the UAE. He was soon appointed captain of Warwickshire and insisted that he retained further ambitions for a Test career that had already included five Ashes-winning series. ', 'Though England recognition did not come again, Bell enjoyed a fruitful start to his county captaincy, guiding the club to the Royal London One-Day Cup in 2016, before claiming another T20 trophy with Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash. He did not make a Championship century as Warwickshire were relegated in 2017, and he stepped down as skipper towards the end of the season. ', ""Finally came the realisation that he would never play for England again which led to a run-glut in Warwickshire's promotion season the following year - including two hundreds in a match against Glamorgan at Edbaston - and even encouraged a final burst of speculation, as if for old times' sake, that he might be the man to solve England's batting collapses.\n"", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1999, 2000, 2001', 'PCA Young Cricketer of the Year 2004', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005', 'ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2006']",118.0,205,24,7727.0,235,42.69,15622,49.46,22,46,919,39,100.0,0.0,161.0,157,14,5416.0,141,37.87,7019,77.16,4,35,525,32,54.0,0.0,8.0,8,1,188.0,60*,26.85,163,115.33,0,1,23,2,4.0,0.0,307.0,516,55,20256,262*,43.93,,,57,103,,,233.0,0.0,318.0,301,31,11130,158,41.22,,,13,79,,,109.0,0.0,104.0,100,12,2749,131,31.23,2204,124.72,1,18,267,69,36.0,0.0,118.0,6,108,76,1.0,1/33,1/33,76.0,4.22,108.0,0,0,0,161.0,6,88,88,6.0,3/9,3/9,14.66,6.00,14.6,0,0,0,8.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,307.0,,2875,1615,47,4/4,,34.36,3.37,61.1,3,0,0,318.0,,1290,1138,33,5/41,5/41,34.48,5.29,39.0,0,1,0,104.0,10,132,186,3,1/12,1/12,62.00,8.45,44.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

A powerfully-built, naggingly accurate, medium-fast bowler, with a classical action off a short run, Bedser's stock ball was the inswinger, his most dangerous the legcutter which fizzed off the pitch like a fast legbreak.  He played twice for Surrey in 1939 (without taking a wicket)  but the war forced him to wait another seven seasons for his next match. An ever-present in the Surrey side from the beginning of the 1946 season, he was immediately picked by England and made his Test debut at the age of 28 (in what was only his 13th first-class match).  He began with 11 wickets in each of his first two Tests, against India, and until 1954 he largely carried England's attack almost single handed - not that he minded as he loved nothing more than bowling.  In 1953, aged 35, he spearheaded England's Ashes victory with 39 wickets at 17.48, including 14 for 99 at Nottingham. He took 100 wickets in a season 11 times, and was instrumental in Surrey's eight Championship victories between 1950  and 1958. In a long career he left the field of play only once, in a heatwave during a Test at Adelaide. He went to the boundary to vomit, returning to carry on bowling.  As a batsman he was limited but correct, and often filled the role of nightwatchman.  His fielding was safe rather than spectacular. After his retirement in 1960 (he bowed out with 5 for 25 against Glamorgan at his beloved Oval), he continued his association with cricket, serving as an England selector for a record 23 years, and was chairman between 1969 and 1981 as well as managing England on two overseas tours. He was knighted in 1996 and made president of Surrey in 1997. Shortly before his death in April 2010 he had become the oldest-surviving English cricketer.

The revised method cost him his place once, by way of punishment for taking 435 minutes to score 137 against a humdrum New Zealand attack at Edgbaston in 1965, but overall it served him brilliantly. England too - before a heart attack forced premature retirement at 37, Barrington amassed 6806 Test runs at an average (58.67) surpassed for England only by Herbert Sutcliffe. A thickset 5ft 9ins, crinkly haired and strong-featured, in anything but batting gear Barrington was jovial and gregarious, always ready to see the best in everyone and every situation. Famous for mixed metaphors, his best-known quip came in answer to a Surrey fan commiserating over his lack of form after a sequence of four low single-figure scores, two ducks among them. ""How d\'you know I\'m out of form?"" shot back Ken indignantly: ""I\'ve only had nine balls all week!"" It shattered Ian Botham\'s touring team when Barrington, England\'s assistant manager and a much-loved figure everywhere he went, died suddenly in Barbados in 1981 after another heart attack.\n', ' \n', ""\nThere should be no need for reticence in anyone paying tribute to Ken Barrington. He died of a heart attack in his hotel room at the Holiday Inn in Barbados on March 14, 1981, the Saturday night of the Barbados Test, while serving as assistant-manager on the England tour of the West Indies. As a player, as a friend, as a businessman and latterly as a leader of England's cricketers in the field, he was a man who always did what he could and, when the chips were on the table for all to see, one who could be relied upon to give of his best, his uttermost. The world and especially the cricketing world cannot ask for more. That is why Ken Barrington, master of the malaprop, the man who slept not like a log but like a lark, commanded such affection all over the world. His widow, Ann, accompanied him on some of his later trips, and it is good that Ann is still involved in the game through the Lord's Taverners, to whom Ken gave so much."", ""Yet reticence there is, and the hesitation is on his family's account in recalling the circumstances of Ken's tragically premature death at the age of 50. However, "", ' is a book of record, and historians sometimes find that its early pages tell the facts but less than the whole truth.', ""To my mind, the story of Ken's death is as heroic as so many of his innings. It came as a great shock in the spring of 1969 to learn that the chest pains which had led him to withdraw from a double-wicket competition in Melbourne had in fact been a heart attack. After due reflection, taking into account not only his family but the fact that, at 38, batting in Test matches, always Ken's particular forte, was not going to get easier, Ken Barrington retired. Immediately the cares of carrying England's rickety batting through the uncertain and far from satisfying sixties slipped off his shoulders, like some leaden cloak. As he took to the village greens of charity cricket and to the golf courses where his game was good enough to be successfully competitive - and therefore a source of pleasure to a man who hated to be beaten - Ken Barrington's step seemed lighter and his stature in cricket enhanced. His admirers, both far and near, began to realise just how much private effort had gone into coping with chuckers and bouncers, as well as the vagaries of form and the whims of selectors."", 'None the less, a heart attack is a warning, a red light that never joins with amber and turns to green. Although he had managed tours to India, Pakistan and New Zealand, and indeed had had the well-deserved honour of leading the England party at the Melbourne Centenary Test, nothing in his managerial career had tested him quite like this final West Indian ordeal. As a player he had not only plundered bowlers on the great Indian sub-continent but, the son of a soldier who might well in other times have done tours in India of a different nature, he established such a good-humoured relationship there that win or lose, come triumph or disaster, the pressures of touring were easily absorbed. In Australia, where the results mattered more, his role was that of coach, so that the burdens were shared first with Doug Insole and then with Alec Bedser.', ""He was playing that same familiar part in the West Indies. Ironically, he had not been one of the early selections, but as an old player scarred in earlier wars against Hall and Griffith, he knew better than most the perils that a new manager, Alan Smith, and an inexperienced captain, Ian Botham, were flying into as they took on the world champions with their fast bowling quartet in the increasingly stormy Caribbean. In Guyana the heavy and persistent rain meant that the practice sessions which were his charge were suspended. They had been difficult in smaller islands like Antigua and St. Vincent in the early weeks of the tour. And then he had to take the team, badly defeated in the first Test and now with their morale increasingly affected by the start of the Jackman affair, as well as their collective lack of practice and form, to the one-day beating at Berbice, while Alan Smith began to play one of his best innings with the politicians. The events of those few days deeply disturbed Barrington. He was also worried about Ann's imminent arrival if the tour was to be cancelled."", ""But once the party arrived safely in Barbados he seemed to relax. My own last, long and treasured conversation with him was in the happy atmosphere of a Cunarder's bridge, a party in the harbour which he himself had organised. Whatever he felt, he was full of hope for the more distant future, his absolute faith in the ability of Botham and Gatting made more significant by the summer of '81. He knew there were gaps in the England side, but he was old enough in the ways of cricket to know that they are not easily filled."", 'It was a little thing, at least in the context of that global conversation, that piled all the pressure back on to this caring man. At fielding practice it was Barrington who hit the ball that split Gooch\'s hand. Gooch was due to bat that day, and in fact played better than anyone - as he told me, without too much discomfort. However, Ken took it badly, as he was bound to do, but it was the way in which he said to Bernard Thomas, ""I didn\'t mean to hurt him,"" that in retrospect gave the party\'s medical superintendent the first indication that events were getting out of proportion, upsetting the nervous balance. It was that night, with the Barringtons ready for bed, that the attack struck Ken down. Ann Barrington summoned Bernard Thomas, who was next door, and he knew at once that the attack had been instantaneously fatal. Next morning, when the team stood in Ken\'s memory, there were many tears.', ""My own first encounter with Ken Barrington was in 1948 when I was a boy at Harrow. Tom Barling, the new school coach, brought over from The Oval, where he had not long ceased to play for Surrey, a young leg-spinner from Reading with a West Country burr in his voice. The intention was not only to give us practice against a type of bowling that Harrow were likely to meet in the match against Eton at Lord's but also to show us what a "", ' cricketer in the making looked like. We were both seventeen. From then on his career in cricket progressed with its ration of setbacks until he became a record-breaking Test batsman, proudest of all in his unique achievement of scoring a century on every Test ground in England and in every Test-playing country.', 'As ', "" is a chronicle and as this was a man who rated only the best, it is not inappropriate that the essay on him as one of the Five Cricketers of the Year in the 1960 edition should have been written by Norman Preston and the piece on his retirement by John Woodcock, Preston's successor as Editor, in the 1970 edition. It is appropriate, too, to add to those assessments of his playing ability his ever-maturing skill as a leg-spinner. No-one ever bowled more enthusiastically in the nets on tour than Barrington, and whether they realised it or not the England players who faced him were getting practice against a player who might have done the double in the 1930s, a decade less demanding at Test level than the 1960s."", 'It is with his career in cricket during the last ten years of his life that this eulogy is chiefly concerned. It was at Adelaide during the difficult Australian tour of 1974-75 that Barrington first began to believe that he had a contribution to make as a coach at the highest level. He was brought up in a generation which believed as an act of faith that once a cricketer had played at Test level he knew it all. How else could he have been selected? Furthermore, and this is still a more prevalent attitude than Barrington liked, a player who makes as much of a fetish about practising as Boycott is regarded as a freak. As one who had to work out his technique, to subordinate under a layer of discipline the stroke-making ability he had acquired in his early days, Barrington by the time he retired was a batsman who, if he never knew it all, was a scholar (as well as a gentleman) compared to the players he now saw trying to cope with Lillee and Thomson at their devastating best. More than once Barrington himself had had to change his approach both in style and mind, and so he was ideally suited to the task of developing younger talent and skills.', ""Not every captain appreciates the need for such a rôle; or knows how to put such available experience to its best use. Ironically, it was on his last tour that Barrington really came to fulfil himself in this the last, and to my mind, most difficult of his cricketing lives. By that time he had mastered the art of subordinating self and position without losing respect or the power to contribute. He would get me a cup of tea, suggest something which I'd reject probably because I was tired, but then I'd do it and usually it worked. This was Ian Botham during his apprentice days as captain. To the generation that is coming to full maturity Ken Barrington had become as important as the maypole; something solid. He was the Colonel around whom a team of cricketers could revolve while playing no part in the dance himself."", ""Like the maypole he was, too, a source of great happiness, with that rare gift of turning events into comic sketches as they happened. The rat hunt in the Ritz at Hyderabad is now part of cricketing legend. Some wretched rodent, unaware of niceties of protocol, had eaten the shoulder out of the manager's England blazer in its search for nesting materials. By the time the Colonel's army was assembled, the entire staff of the hotel and all its brushes and brooms were ready to go into action. The villain was struck but not apprehended, and after such a warning honour was seen to have been satisfied on all sides."", 'Now that he is gone, it is possible that the rôle he created and played may be forgotten through want of a successor. But Ken gave so much to cricket in the 1970s that he had left a few campaigners for the cause for the remainder of the 1980s. Even now as Gooch starts or finishes a drive or Gatting hooks, a memory of Barrington the batsman is stirred. For a coach there is no finer memorial than that. It is the man, though, that his contemporaries will miss; and for this one, at least, the hole that he began to dig on the Sixth Form Ground at Harrow more than thirty years ago is never going to be filled.\n']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1960', 'Walter Lawrence Trophy 1966']",82.0,131,15,6806.0,256,58.67,,,20,35,,27,58.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,533.0,831,136,31714,256,45.63,,,76,170,,,514.0,0.0,14.0,14,2,399,70*,33.25,,,0,3,,,5.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82.0,50,2715,1300,29.0,3/4,5/111,44.82,2.87,93.6,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,533.0,,17301,8905,273,7/40,,32.61,3.08,63.3,,8,0,14.0,,108,132,4,3/41,3/41,33.00,7.33,27.0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He was a punishing right-hander who opened, for Gloucestershire once he became established and played in 20 Tests for England before and after the war. He came from a well-known Gloucestershire cricketing family - his father (C. S.) and two uncles all played for the county, as amateurs - and after going to Wycliffe College he began as an amateur (against Cambridge in 1927, when he was 16). Although he turned professional in 1929, Barnett retained a certain amateur hauteur in his cricket and his life; the supporters knew him as Charlie, but he always regarded himself as Charles. In the dressing-room he became known as The Guv'nor. \n"", 'In the early days Barnett made a lot of runs in the middle order, often at great speed. But for several years there was more talk of his promise than his achievements. However, when the solid opener A. E. Dipper retired in 1932, Barnett was promoted in his place. It was the making of him - it was in his nature to get on with the business. But he also acquired more defence. In May 1933 he scored his first century in county cricket; in August he made 111 and 93 against Somerset with an assurance and dash he had not quite previously approached. A week later he was playing for England against West Indies at The Oval. He made 52 even though he had to bat No. 8. By the end of the season he had scored 2,280 runs.', "" Barnett's attacking style was based on driving and a scorching square cut if given room; it was his ability to drive on the up on the sandy Bristol wickets which particularly astonished his team-mates. He was not a consistent player but between 1933 and 1948 he hit 48 centuries, averaged over 36, passed the 2,000 mark four times, and only twice scored less than 1,500 runs in an English season. A feature of Barnett's career was that he lacked a regular opening partner for either Gloucestershire or England. On the first of his two tours, to India in 1933-34, he was obliged to bat down the order; in Australia in 1936-37, when he was the leading run-scorer, he opened with Worthington, Fagg and Verity; in 1938 it looked as though Barnett and Hutton might become the successors to Hobbs and Sutcliffe, but he was dropped before The Oval, missed out on the tour to South Africa and did not play a Test match for nine years."", ""Yet in the First Test at Trent Bridge he came nearer than anyone had done to scoring a first-morning hundred before lunch; he got there the first ball he received afterwards, with a four past extra cover. And by tea-time he had a telegram from his mother in Cirencester: Heartiest congratulations, it said, everyone round about it delighted. It was the second and last of his Test centuries; the first, at Adelaide in a losing cause in 1936-37, was described by Neville Cardus as involving severe discipline for him. Yet there were several near-misses. Robertson-Glasgow said Barnett was a player who made colossal blunders. He cuts the ball in the first over of a Test match, and the ball flies past the head of an outraged gully, who was dreaming of stalemates and composing himself to eternity. Or it doesn't fly past, but sticks in some hand... genius has turned to folly."", 'But in his mature years the genius often had the upper hand, with huge and dominating scores in county cricket: he hit 11 sixes in his 194 against Somerset in 1934 that same year he simply flogged the bowling for 170 against Worcestershire at Dudley. As the years went by, he also became an ever more effective bowler with a stock in-swinger above medium pace varied with a leg-cutter. In 1947 he was ninth in the bowling averages, with 50 wickets. In his career, he took 394 wickets at 30.98 to go with the 25,389 runs at 32.71, an average that suggests his style rather than his greatness.', 'He failed to make runs in his four Tests after the war, though he continued making big scores in county cricket. In 1948, he retired abruptly to play League cricket for Rochdale, to the chagrin of Gloucestershire supporters, who had recently lost Hammond as well. Though his batting was cheerful, he was a serious minded man. On the SS Orion to Australia, Barnett shared a cabin with Verity and they read ', ' to each other. In retirement, he ran a business in Cirencester. A journalist called him a fishmonger. He wrote an indignant letter, saying he supplied high-class poultry and game, not least to the Duke of Beaufort. He maintained his amateur mien: he lived like a squire and hunted with the Beaufort and the Berkeley Vale, always, so it is said, with the uncomplicated verve he displayed at the crease.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1937'],20.0,35,4,1098.0,129,35.41,,,2,5,,5,14.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,498.0,821,45,25388,259,32.71,,,48,113,,,320.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20.0,8,256,93,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.17,-,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,498.0,,28233,12207,394,6/17,,30.98,2.59,71.6,,12,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Died at Chadsmoor, Staffordshire, December 26, 1967. Sydney Francis Barnes was the second son of five children of Richard Barnes who spent nearly all his life in Staffordshire and worked for a Birmingham firm for 63 years. The father played only a little cricket and Sydney Barnes averred that he never had more than three hours' coaching, but he practised assiduously to perfect the leg-break after learning the off-break from the Smethwick professional, Billy Ward of Warwickshire. \n"", 'Most cricketers and students of the game belonging to the period in which S.F. Barnes played were agreed that he was the bowler of the century. Australians as well as English voted him unanimously the greatest. Clem Hill, the famous  Australian left-handed batsman, who in successive Test innings scored 99, 98, 97, v. A.C. MacLaren\'s England team of 1901-02, told me that on a perfect wicket Barnes could swing the new ball in and out ""very late"", could spin from the ground, pitch on the leg stump and miss the off. At  Melbourne, in December 1911, Barnes in five overs overwhelmed Kelleway, Bardsley, Hill and Armstrong for a single.', 'Hill was clean bowled by him. ""The ball pitched outside my leg-stump, safe to the push off my pads, I thought. Before I could `pick up\' my bat, my off-stump was knocked silly.""', 'Barnes was creative, one of the first bowlers really to use the seam of a new ball and combine swing so subtly with spin that few batsmen could distinguish one from the other.', ""He made a name before a new ball was available to an attack every so many runs or overs. He entered first-class cricket at a time when one ball had to suffice for the whole duration of the batting side's innings."", 'He was professional in the Lancashire League when A.C. MacLaren, hearing of his skill, invited him to the nets at Old Trafford. ""He thumped me on the left thigh. He hit my gloves from a length. He actually said, `Sorry, sir!\' and I said, `Don\'t be sorry, Barnes. You\'re coming to Australia with me.\'""', 'MacLaren on the strength of a net practice with Barnes chose him for his  England team in Australia of 1901-02. In the first Test of that rubber, Barnes took five for 65 in 35.1 overs, and one for 74 in 16 overs. In the second Test he took six for 42 and seven for 121 and he bowled 80 six-ball overs in this game.', 'He broke down, leg strain, in the third Test and could bowl no more for MacLaren, who winning the first Test, lost the next four of the rubber.', 'Barnes bowled regularly for Lancashire in 1902, taking more than a hundred wickets in the season, averaging around 20. ', ' actually found fault with his attack this year, stating that he needed to cultivate an ""off-break"". In the late nineties he had appeared almost anonymously in the Warwickshire XI.', 'Throughout his career he remained mysteriously aloof, appearing in the full sky of first-class cricket like a meteor -- declaring the death of the most princely of batsmen! He preferred the reward and comparative indolence of Saturday league matches to the daily toil of the county tourney.', ""Here is one of the reasons of his absence from the England XI between 1902 and 1907. He didn't go to Australia as one of P.F. Warner's team of 1903-04 and took no part of the 1905 England v.  Australia rubber. The future historian of cricket may well gape and wonder why, in the crucial Test of 1902, Barnes didn't play for England at Manchester, where the rubber went to Australia by three runs only."", ""Barnes had bowled for England at Sheffield in the third and previous Test, taking six for 49 and one for 50. It is as likely as conjecture about cricket ever can be likely that had  Barnes taken part in the famous Manchester Test of 1902 England wouldn't have lost the rubber by a hair's breadth."", ""He was in those days not an easy man to handle on the field of play. There was a Mephistophelian aspect about him. He didn't play cricket out of any green field starry-eyed idealism. He rightly considered that his talents were worth estimating in cash values. In his old age he mellowed, yet remained humorously cynical."", 'Sir Donald Bradman argued that W.J. O\'Reilly must have been a greater bowler than Barnes because he commanded every ball developed in Barnes\'s day -- plus the googly. I told Barnes of Bradman\'s remark. ""It\'s quite true,"" he said, ""I never bowled the `googly.\'"" Then with a glint in his eye, he added, ""I never needed it.""', ""Against Australia he took 106 wickets, average 21.58. Only Trumble and Peel have improved on these figures in Tests between England and  Australia (I won't count Turner's 101 wickets at 16.53 because he bowled in conditions not known to  Barnes and  Trumble)."", 'Barnes had no opportunities to pick up easy victims. He played only against Australia and South Africa and, in all Test matches, his haul was 189 at 16.43 each. ', ""On matting in South Africa when South Africa's batsmanship, at its greatest, was represented by H.W. Taylor, A.D. Nourse, L.J. Tancred, J.W. Zulch, in 1913-14, he was unplayable, with 49 wickets in four Tests at 10.93 each. It was said he refused to play in the fifth match because he contended the South Africans had not carried out their promise of special reward if he took part in the tour."", 'In the second Test at Johannesburg, Barnes took 17 wickets for 159, a record which stood until 1956 when  Laker laid low Australia at Old Trafford with his unique figures of 19 for 90.', ""Yet against Barnes's fantastically swinging, bouncing, late-turning attack on that 1913-14 tour, Herbie Taylor scored 508 runs, average 50.80, perhaps the most skilful of all Test performances by a batsman."", 'Barnes was a man of character. At Sydney on the 1911-12 tour, J.W.H.T. Douglas opened the England attack using the new ball with Frank Foster. Barnes was furious. He sulked as he sent down 35 overs for three wickets and 107 runs (in the match he took only four for 179). England lost by 146 runs.', 'At Melbourne, Australia batted first and Barnes this time had the new ball. We all know with what results. Australia suffered defeat -- and also in the ensuing three games. The destruction wreaked by Barnes, and on all his great days, was mostly done by the ball which, bowled from a splendid height, seemed to swing in to the leg stump then spin away from the pitch, threatening the off-stump. Barnes assured me that he actually turned the ball by finger twist.', 'The wonder of his career is that he took 77 of his 106 Australian Test wickets on the wickets of Australia when they were flawless and the scourge of all ordinarily good bowlers. He clean bowled Victor Trumper for 0 at Sydney in the 1907-08 rubber; then Fielder and J.N. Crawford in the following Test dismissed Trumper for a  pair, so Trumper was out for 0 in three successive Test innings.', 'Barnes remained a deadly bowler long after he went out of first-class cricket. So shrewdly did he conserve his energy that in 1928 when he was in his mid-fifties, the West Indies team of that year faced him in a club match and unanimously agreed he was the best they had encountered in the season.', 'For Staffordshire, in his fifty-sixth year, he took 76 wickets at 8.21 each. Round about this period a young player, later to become famous in international company, was one of the Lancashire Second XI playing against Staffordshire.', 'His captain won the toss and two Lancashire lads went forth to open the innings against Barnes. As this colt was number six in the batting order he put on his blazer and was about to leave the pavilion to watch Barnes from behind. But his captain told him to go back to the dressing room and get on his pads. ""But,"" said the colt, ""I\'m not in until number six and I\'d like to look at Barnes."" His captain insisted. The young colt returned to the dressing room. And there, he said ""there were four of us all padded up waiting. And we were all out in the middle and back again in half an hour.""', 'Barnes had a splendid upright action, right arm straight over. He ran on easy strides, not a penn\'orth of energy wasted. He fingered a cricket ball sensitively, like a violinist his fiddle. He always attacked. ""Why do these bowlers today send down so many balls the batsman needn\'t play?"" he asked while watching a Test match many years ago. ""I didn\'t. I never gave\'em any rest.""', ""His hatchet face and his suggestion of physical and mental leanness and keenness were part of Barnes's cricket and outlook on the game. He was relentless, a chill wind of antagonism blew from him on the sunniest day. As I say, he mellowed in full age and retirement."", ""He came to  Lord's and other grounds for Test matches, even in his ninety-fifth year, leading blind Wilfred Rhodes about. And to the end of his life he worked for his living, drawing up legal and other documents for Staffordshire County Council in the most beautiful copperplate writing he learned as a boy."", 'As we think of the unsmiling destroyer of all the batsmen that came his way, let us also remember Barnes immortalised in that lovely verse of Alan Ross: ', 'Other tributes to Barnes included: ', ', President of  M.C.C.: He will be mourned by cricketers the world over. He was the finest bowler there ever was and a magnificent personality after his playing days.', ', Secretary of  M.C.C.: The extraordinary thing about him was that all his contemporaries considered him the greatest bowler. There was never any doubts in their minds. This must have been unique.', "", who celebrated his 90th birthday in October, 1967, one of the greatest of cricket's all-rounders, and one of the few remaining contemporaries of Barnes in the  England side: Barnes was a very fine medium-paced bowler, the best I ever played with. He had a lovely run-up to the wicket, carrying the ball in his left hand until he was only two paces from the crease and then transferring it to his right. He kept a perfect length and direction and, if you wanted to field close to the wicket say, at short leg, you could stand up to the batsman without any fear. He was quite a decent bat, far better than he was made out to be and too good for a number eleven. He was also a very good fielder."", ', the old Surrey and England wicketkeeper (now 88): He was the greatest bowler I ever kept wicket to, for he sent down something different each ball of the over. He could turn it either way in remarkable fashion and I shall never forget keeping to him for the first time in a Gentlemen v. Players match at The Oval. His opening delivery pitched outside the leg stump and flew over the top of the off stump. I said to a team-mate: ""What sort of bowler have we here?"" I soon found out. Sydney could do almost anything with the ball. On matting wickets in South Africa where I toured with him, he was practically unplayable.', 'Barnes took 14 wickets for 13 runs, less than one run apiece, playing for Staffordshire against Cheshire in 1909.', 'Against Northumberland he took 16 for 93 in one day.

As an offspinner, he gives the ball less flight than he used to, but still possesses a deceptive arm ball. With the bat, he collects most of his runs with front-foot drives, but his back-foot play has improved since the Aussies roughed him up in 1997. Croft has fallen in and out with the selectors, and when he was dropped in 2000, he huffily declared he'd had enough anyway. He was a fixture in England's one-day side from the end of 1996 until the World Cup in 1999, and bowled with real guile during the Tests in New Zealand in 1996-97. But his confidence took a battering in 1997, and his career waned: the flight and turn virtually vanished, and his best moment came as a batsman, when he held South Africa at bay for more than three hours to save the Old Trafford Test in 1998.  \n"", ""Croft tried to reinvent himself in 2000, but his new variations proved to be no more than gimmicks. He did nonetheless play a part in England's success in Sri Lanka, replacing Ian Salisbury and forming an effective partnership with Ashley Giles. But his career was effectively ended when he pulled out of England's tour to India in November 2001 because of concerns over safety. Although he was picked to tour Sri Lanka in 2003-04, he sat out all three Tests and, shortly after returning home, he announced his retirement from international cricket, to enable him to concentrate full-time on the captaincy of his beloved Glamorgan. "", 'In that job, he excelled: under his leadership, Glamorgan won the one-day league in 2004 and in the same year they returned to Division One of the Championship. Croft has led by example on and off the pitch and his appointment as captain did not diminish his consistent form with both bat and ball. However, he stepped down as captain towards the end of the 2006 season, handing the reins to David Hemp. ', ""In 2007 he signed a contract extension, admitting that he was in the twilight of his career but setting himself the goal of reaching 1,000 first-class wickets. His performances barely dimmed, and in July 2010 - the year he turned 40 - he became the first Glamorgan player to achieve the 1,000-wicket, 10,000-run double in county cricket on the second day of their County Championship clash against Leicestershire at Swansea. He also became the ninth player in the post-war era to reach the landmark in county cricket, joining Trevor Bailey, Tony Brown, Tom Cartwright, Ray Illingworth, Derek Morgan, John Mortimore, Peter Sainsbury and Fred Titmus.

In no time, Ballance's nuggety left-handed batting style was providing the backbone of England's line-up. There was nothing overly stylish about his approach, but his discipline and shrewdness was apparent and he could step up the tempo when necessary. Ballance, in the coach's parlance was a batman who Found A Way. \n"", ""Ballance's reputation began to blossom during a run-rich 2013 season for Yorkshire after which he was selected for England's tour of Australia. He made his Test debut in Sydney at the end of England's 5-0 whitewash and followed up an ODI debut in Dublin the previous summer with further limited-overs forays against Australia."", ""But it was 2014, as England sought comfort after the loss of Trott, where England found a batsman to sustain them. A maiden Test hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's was followed by two in successive Tests against India, at Lord's again and Southampton.  Only Trott and Andrew Strauss had previously made hundreds in their first two Tests at Lord's; 1,019 runs at 67.93 in his first 10 Tests ranked alongside the finest starts to an England career.  There was some low-key drunken notoriety as well as he stripped topless in a Nottingham night club to celebrate victory over India at Trent Bridge. "", 'That sense of chubby, red-faced permanence ran aground in 2015 as firstly he lost his ODI place and then New Zealand and Australia, in turn, exposed a shuffling back-foot technique and, amid heavy criticism, he was dropped for the third Ashes Test with his team-mate Jonny Bairstow preferred. Few batsmen played so strikingly deep in the crease, but he insisted that he would remain true to the method that had brought him such success. Such faith did not bring immediate rewards: a return against Pakistan the following summer brought limited rewards before four single-figure scores in Bangladesh consigned him to inactivity on the subsequent five-Test tour of India.', ""Such was the pessimism around his England chances that Yorkshire made him captain in the Championship and he responded with an early-season avalanche of runs, becoming only the second Yorkshire batsman (Younis Khan was the other) to hit a double century and century in the same match, to save the game against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl. With England's top-order failings evident, he gained a reprieve for two Tests against South Africa, that once gilded average now well below 40, and found himself in the Ashes squad for the 2017/18 tour."", ""Ballance's roots are Zimbabwean. Aged just 16, he appeared for Zimbabwe at the 2006 Under-19 World Cup, taking three wickets and top-scoring with the bat in a win over England, the country he had already settled on moving to in order to pursue a career. He took up a sports scholarship at Harrow the same year and his relationship to Dave Houghton (who is married to the cousin of Ballance's father), facilitated several appearances for Derbyshire as a schoolboy, including an innings of 73 in a Pro40 game while still aged 16."", ""At the end of 2007, Ballance signed an academy contract with Yorkshire, allowing him to begin a university course at Leeds Metropolitan University - although he dropped out after a year. He made his Yorkshire debut in 2008, sharing digs for a time with his soon-to-be England colleague Joe Root, but only featured sporadically at first. In 2011, he was one of Yorkshire's better players as they were relegated in the Championship. He added 717 runs at 42.17 in the Championship and 331 runs at 55.16 in the Clydesdale Bank 40, and was rewarded with a two-year contract extension."", 'During the winter off-seasons, he plied his trade for Mid West Rhinos in Zimbabwe and cracked the first double-hundred of his career for them in 2011-12. He passed 1000 first-class runs in only 14 innings during the season and captained Rhinos to the final of the 50-over Coca-Cola Cup competition.', 'As Yorkshire regained their Division One status at the first attempt in 2012, Ballance was again a key figure. His 613 Championship runs included an unbeaten 121 as Yorkshire completed the second-biggest successful run chase in their history against Gloucestershire at Bristol in May, when they knocked off a target of 400 in 110 overs; Ballance clinched victory with a four followed by consecutive sixes. ', ""Such performances led to his selection for the England Lions squad for a limited-overs tour of Australia in February 2013, where Ballance made three half-centuries despite the team losing every game. Centuries for the Lions against Australia and Bangladesh A during the 2013 season pressed his case further and led to an ODI debut against Ireland. He made a two-ball duck but 1251 Championship runs, including five hundreds, were enough to win him a place in England's Ashes squad to tour Australia."", 'Despite growing up on a tobacco farm in Harare, Ballance does have British roots through his grandparents, one of whom flew for the RAF during World War II. He is also distantly related to John Timms, who played for Northamptonshire between 1925 and 1949.\n', '\n']","['ICC Emerging Cricketer of the Year 2014', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2015']",23.0,42,2,1498.0,156,37.45,3176,47.16,4,7,195,8,22.0,0.0,16.0,15,1,297.0,79,21.21,443,67.04,0,2,21,1,8.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,145.0,238,22,10268,210,47.53,19732,52.03,35,48,1310,64,116.0,0.0,103.0,96,14,4066,152*,49.58,4569,88.99,7,25,352,72,41.0,0.0,85.0,76,9,1624,79,24.23,1318,123.21,0,6,117,67,43.0,0.0,23.0,2,12,5,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.50,-,0,0,0,16.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,145.0,9,162,154,0,-,-,-,5.70,-,0,0,0,103.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,85.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

She scored a total of 1,078 runs, including four centuries and seven 50s in her Test career which spanned 11 years. Bakewell scored a fifty in both innings four times, a century and 50 in the same Test twice and is one of only two players to have scored back-to-back Test centuries - Jan Brittin is the other. And the records just keep coming. She twice amassed more than 300 runs in a three-Test series, hitting 412 in five innings against New Zealand in 1968 and 309 in six innings against the West Indies in 1979. She scored a ton and took five wickets in three Tests, a feat achieved by only two other players. And, in 1979 against the West Indies she became the first English player, male or female, to score a ton and take 10 wickets in the same Test, which was also her last appearance.

She scored 118 in England's World Cup final defeat of Australia in 1973 - and her one-day career was something to write home about, too.

After a mid-season dispute with Surrey in 1909 he settled in Australia, playing with distinction for South Australia and paying a visit to New Zealand with an Australian XI, in 1914. In the course of this tour he played an extraordinary innings in a two-day fixture with a South Canterbury XV at Temuka.

The passing of talent between the generations could not have been more satisfactorily captured."", 'Many suspected that, long term, Bairstow would become a specialist batsman and his debut innings in one-day internationals backed up that theory as he hit an unbeaten 41 off 21 balls against India at Cardiff before a tough tour of India showed the realities of international cricket. However, further development followed with a match-winning T20 innings against Pakistan in the UAE and after a strong start to the 2012 season he was handed a call-up to the Test squad to face West Indies.', ""It was not a happy series for Bairstow, whose problems against some hostile short bowling from Kemar Roach gained much media attention, and after a modest return of 38 runs at 12.66 he was left out of the opening Test of the South Africa series as England went with Ravi Bopara. Confirmation that he had slipped back in the selectors' thinking came when Bopara withdrew from the second Test for personal reasons and James Taylor was preferred."", ""But after Kevin Pietersen was dropped in extraordinary circumstances for the third Test at Lord's, another opportunity arose for Bairstow to which he responded magnificently. Confidence bolstered by a century for England Lions against Australia A, he led an England fightback from 54 for 4 in their first innings on day two with a brilliant 95, emerging from a peppering with short deliveries to play some fluent attacking shots in an innings former England captain Michael Vaughan said would have been the finest maiden Test century he had witnessed had his fellow Yorkshireman not been bowled by Morne Morkel."", 'His increasing international involvement restricted his appearances for Yorkshire, although he did find time to hit 182 - his second biggest first-class score - to set up a crushing win over Leicestershire at Scarborough in the Championship and a match-winning 68 not out against Sussex in the semi-finals of the FLt20.', ""Bairstow retained his place for England's winter schedule, beginning with the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. He was unable to make a significant contribution and his participation in the India Test series was also limited before he was granted leave to return home because of a family illness, missing the subsequent ODI series."", ""Thereafter his bit-part status congealed - he lost his spot in the T20 team following the New Zealand tour and, after returning to the Test team during the Ashes as England dropped Nick Compton and moved Joe Root up the order, he was abruptly left out at The Oval. He spent much of the summer running 12th man errands at a crucial stage in his development. A squad member for the return tour of Australia, he played in the last two Tests, replacing the out-of-form Matt Prior, but did not unearth the performances to promote his worth as Prior's long-term successor and had to buckle down to the county circuit the following summer."", ""That 2015 season promised to be the making of him as he struck 1108 first-class runs at 92.33, allowed by Yorkshire to play as he saw fit. Nothing was more emphatic than his 366-run alliance with Tim Bresnan at Chester-le-Street, both players making carer-bests, Yorkshire's fifth highest stand of all time. England were receptive. A combative 83 not out at Chester-le-Street after a late summons settled a weather-hit ODI against New Zealand in England's favour and the faltering form of Buttler brought a Test recall against Australia."", ""It was Cape Town, though, where Bairstow really broke through, as the summer of 2016 testified. Bairstow's second Test ton was reserved for his home crowd against Sri Lanka: 140, batting at No. 7, out of 298. On a challenging surface, he played with a certainty not given to others. England's top order was repeatedly found wanting in Test cricket, but the belligerence of Bairstow and co down the order constantly dug them out of a hole, and another hundred at Lord's followed."", 'His desire was relentless and his growing impact in ODIs was enough for him to replace the out-of-form Jason Roy at the top of the order in the Champions Trophy semi-final - a defeat against Pakistan in Cardiff. The West Indies felt his frustration at that at the end of the summer in the form of his first two ODI hundreds.\n', '\n', '\n']","['Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year 2007', ""Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year 2011"", 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2009, 2011']",63.0,109,6,3806.0,167*,36.95,6839,55.65,6,20,447,24,160.0,11.0,59.0,54,8,2118.0,141*,46.04,2017,105.00,6,8,232,46,24.0,2.0,30.0,25,6,513.0,68,27.00,394,130.2,0,3,48,19,28.0,0.0,174.0,285,32,11352,246,44.86,,,24,61,,,446.0,22.0,127.0,116,14,4040,174,39.60,3901,103.56,9,18,390,105,75.0,8.0,99.0,87,17,1766,102*,25.22,1383,127.69,1,7,131,68,61.0,10.0,63.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,59.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,30.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,174.0,1,6,1,0,-,-,-,1.00,-,0,0,0,127.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,99.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

December 24, 1932, Bangalore, India ","December 4, 2000, Angmering Park, Littlehampton, Sussex (aged 67 years 346 days) ",,"['England,', 'Gentlemen,', 'Kent,', 'Marylebone Cricket Club,', 'Oxford University']",Tonbridge; Oxford University,,,,Right-hand bat,Legbreak,,"['Father - ', ',', 'Son - ', ',', 'Son - ', ',', 'Grandson - ']",,"['\n', ' ', '\nBaron Cowdrey of Tonbridge, died on December 4, 2000, aged 67, after suffering a stroke earlier in the year. Michael Colin Cowdrey was successively known to the world as Michael Cowdrey - when ', ' reported on him as a 13-year-old schoolboy prodigy - Colin Cowdrey, Sir Colin and finally Lord Cowdrey, when he became the first English cricketer to be given a peerage. In an era of outstanding English batsmen, he was the most durable, with a Test career spanning more than two decades. On his journey from teenage phenomenon to sporting statesmen, he was at the heart of the game for half a century: Cowdrey was the first man to play 100 Tests, captained England 27 times and scored almost 43,000 first-class runs - 7,624 of them in Tests. In later years, he played a major role behind the scenes in marrying the traditions of international cricket with modern demands. Yet it was still possible, and only mildly unkind, for one of his contemporaries, Fred Trueman, to describe Cowdrey on his death as ""a terrific talent who never fulfilled his potential"". Amid the triumphs there was often a vague sense of unease: of unexpected failures, opportunities not taken. Despite everything, Cowdrey never achieved the greatest accolade English cricket can offer: he toured Australia six times, which equalled a world record held by Johnny Briggs, but never once was he selected as captain; every time a more forceful figure shoved him out of the way when it mattered. \n', ""His entire early career, and most of the rest of it, was the stuff of male fantasy. His father, Ernest, a tea planter in India, was a first-class cricketer too, scoring 48 for the Europeans against MCC at Madras. Colin's parents met at a cricket club and, when he was born on Christmas Eve 1932, he was - famously - given the initials MCC, just in case anyone doubted his destiny. On the plantation Colin would play with an Indian boy eight years his senior, with occasional supervision from his father who initiated a rule, to encourage correct technique, that all leg-side shots would be given out. Colin was sent to a sporty prep school, Homefield, and apparently reached a century in his first proper match, only to give his wicket away and then discover that he had only 93. A modern thinker might be more conscious of the traumas rather than the triumphs. An only child - and not an insensitive one either - in the stern English schools of the 1940s, Colin did not see his parents for seven years owing to the twin tyrannies of distance and war. If, as countless spectators and writers later theorised, he had psychological flaws as a cricketer, who could be surprised? But skill at games is a great consolation to a boy, and Cowdrey was a natural: at golf, rackets and squash, as well as cricket. Within weeks of arriving at Tonbridge, he was in the First Eleven, though more for his leg-spin than his batting,  and in the annual match against Clifton, then still played at Lord's, he scored 75 and 44, and took eight for 117. At 13, he was thought to be the youngest player ever at Lord's."", 'His leg-spin did not develop: Cowdrey later theorised that he could not grip a larger, adult, ball so well with his small hands, and that he lacked the necessary ""bottle"". But his batting began to flower gloriously: it was said that Maurice Tate, the last of his coaches at Tonbridge, would forget to signal while umpiring because he was so engrossed in Colin\'s strokeplay. As a 16-year-old he made an unbeaten 181 against the Buccaneers and was picked for Kent Second Eleven; at 17, he averaged 79 at school and, in August 1950, was eased into the county first team. At 18, just before he was due to go to Oxford, he scored 90 against Hampshire and 71 against the South Africans, became the youngest Kent player to be capped, and was picked for the Gentlemen at Scarborough against a Players side captained by Len Hutton. Cowdrey hit 106. At Oxford, his batting was impressive rather than earth-shattering. But he scored a century in the 1953 University Match, which prompted E.W. Swanton, in the Daily Telegraph, to compare him to Walter Hammond, the same thought that had struck Hutton two years earlier. He went close to 2,000 runs for Oxford and Kent that year but fell back in 1954 - he was astonished (more embarrassed than elated, according to one account) when he was chosen for the tour of Australia. He was 21. His parents saw him off at Tilbury; three weeks later, his father, aged 54, died of heart disease.', 'Only a few weeks after that, Cowdrey went out and attained cricketing manhood. Before he had even scored a Championship century, he made two hundreds in the match against a mighty New South Wales team. ""He played throughout his two innings without a shadow of uncertainty,"" wrote Alan Ross, ""the margin for error as negligible as in Hutton\'s own technique."" The only question now was where, not whether, Cowdrey would bat in the Test match. In the end, England shied away from making him open - this time. He began with a crisp 40 in the defeat at Brisbane; at Sydney, in the Second Test, his partnership with Peter May turned the game; on New Year\'s Eve at Melbourne, he scored 102 out of 191 against Lindwall and Miller at their most incisive on a bad pitch: ""a blend of leisurely driving and secure back play, of power and propriety,"" according to Ross. England won the game and , after he had made another 79 at Adelaide, the Ashes. A star was born.', 'But even in that glad, confident morning there were the first tiny clouds of criticism that would never go away. During his wonderful maiden century Cowdrey was becalmed on 56 for 40 minutes and, though it was now commonplace to compare him to Hammond, Hutton noted drily: ""Wally was hungrier."" When he came home, Cowdrey was conscripted into the RAF, then discharged after failing the medical because of damaged feet: he was attacked for this by MPs and anonymous letter-writers alike. An injured hand kept him out of all but one of the 1955 Tests. In the 1956 Ashes series he was obliged to open, which he never enjoyed, and South Africa that winter was a struggle. But by now Colin was married - to Penny, daughter of a Kent committee man (soon to be chairman), Stuart Chiesman, who ran a small chain of department stores in Kent. The son-in-law also rises and, though he was not a success in the drapery department at Lewisham, Cowdrey soon became a director of Chiesman\'s company. He was thus instantly freed from the cricket-or-business dilemma that had forced generations of amateurs out of the game prematurely, and which still haunted contemporaries such as May and Ted Dexter.', 'In 1957, he also became captain of Kent, a job he would hold for 15 seasons. But when West Indies toured that year, Cowdrey was not a certain selection for England. And when he went out to join May at 113 for three in the second innings of the opening Test at Edgbaston, England were still in thrall to Sonny Ramadhin and facing an innings defeat. It became one of the most famous Test match stands: 411 in eight hours 20 minutes. Not merely did they save the game, they transformed the relationship between the sides: Ramadhin was never a match-winner again. While May counter-attacked, Cowdrey stayed in his crease and played this most mysterious of bowlers as if he were an off-spinner, pushing forward and letting the leg-break go by. ""Once Colin had committed himself to a policy of complete defence,"" said May later, ""his technique was so good that he made no mistake in execution."" Three weeks later, the other Cowdrey reasserted himself and he smashed 152 at Lord\'s, followed by 55, 68 and two. England were now so dominant that he never needed to bat twice in any of the last four Tests. So, at last, his cricketing personality was starting to emerge fully. He would still be compared to Hammond, especially when he launched into his cover drive or pouched slip catches with absolute certainty. But there was still something of Hobbs: the lightness of touch both technically and spiritually - with a sense that he sympathised with a bowler a shade too much for the sternest tastes. And there was also something all his own: an introspection that, as at Edgbaston, could help him think through cricketing problems like a master detective, but at other times could exasperate even his closest admirers.', ""Cowdrey did not, between Tests, impose himself on county cricket: as with Hobbs, a hundred was enough, and he also found slow, constricting seamers rather tiresome (he would later name Barry Wood, the Lancashire dobber, as the bowler he hated facing most). He was arguably more impressive when the England ship sank in Australia in 1958-59 than against weak New Zealand the previous summer, and his century at Sydney saved England from a 5-0 whitewash. Soon, however, he was forced both to revert to opening and to take over as captain because May was ill. Ostensibly, both moves were successful: he continued to score steadily and England were unbeaten in his first ten Tests in charge, until Lord's 1961. For this game May was back in the side, and after it the selectors restored him to the captaincy for the rest of the Ashes  series. Their friendship was solid - May's seniority was unquestioned and he was steadily fading out of the game - so Cowdrey still had every reason to assume he would return to the captaincy with the same certainty that characterised his rise to it."", ""But he chose not to go to India and Pakistan in 1961-62 (not an unusual decision at the time); Dexter took over, did well, and so began the saga that dominated English cricket throughout the 1960s. Should Cowdrey be captain? Or A.N. Other? With Walter Robins as chairman of selectors, the debate was widened before the 1962-63 Ashes tour to include the Rev. David Sheppard, who was encouraged away from his pastoral work in the East End by the possibility of captaincy. Dexter won the contest and Cowdrey was again No. 2, though he was the senior partner in the moment of glory, when he made 113 and 58 not out to secure victory at Melbourne. By now the politics were submerging the cricket, Dexter stayed as captain in 1963. This provided the single most compelling image of Cowdrey's career: the moment he walked out to bat at Lord's with a broken arm. In the event, he had to do nothing, but the injury initially kept him out of contention for the 1963-64 subcontinental tour when Dexter opted out. So M.J.K. Smith, an Oxonian protégé of Cowdrey, took over. For the next three years the captaincy switched between Dexter and Smith, and, for the third time, Cowdrey went to Australia as faithful Achates, this time to Smith. He was now nearing his mid-thirties, and might have been edging towards retirement, as Dexter was, but when Smith was axed after England were hammered by West Indies at the start of the 1966 series, there seemed to be no one else."", ""The next three Tests also went badly, however, and, after a disaster at Headingley, Cowdrey was dropped from the side completely. With Brian Close as captain, England won at The Oval by an innings, and next year Close led England to five wins out of six against India and Pakistan. Cowdrey spent most of summer 1967 leading Kent to both the Gillette Cup and their most spirited challenge for the Championship since the 1920s, but he was brought back by England at a moment that ensured he missed Kent's crucial match against Yorkshire, which they lost. Close's reputation was sky-high, and every schoolboy (it was after all the 1960s) could assert that a tough-minded professional, raised in the hard northern tradition, was a better leader than an effete southerner like Cowdrey. The argument only intensified when Close was sacked after a time-wasting incident and a row with a spectator in county cricket. He was vetoed as captain for the West Indies tour, and Cowdrey was back, but very clearly as second choice."", 'Again he returned in triumph, having cashed in on Garry Sobers\'s much-reviled declaration in Port-of-Spain by scoring 71 himself (""Never has Cowdrey been more superb,"" said the Guardian). And though England yet again failed to win the Ashes in 1968, no one blamed him and there was much rejoicing when he made a hundred in his 100th Test. At the start of 1969, he was more firmly in the saddle than ever. Then an Achilles tendon snapped. His replacement, Ray Illingworth, was neither a regular Test player nor an experienced captain, but he proved a success and the following summer, before the Ashes tour, the selectors had to choose again. When he gave Cowdrey the news, Alec Bedser, the chairman, was most apologetic.', ""Cowdrey's fifth Ashes tour, his fourth as vice-captain, was a miserable one, even though the Ashes were won. He was ill for much of the following summer, and his career might have been drawing peacefully to its close. In 1970, he had led Kent to the Championship; having inherited a very weak side, he bequeathed Mike Denness a mighty one. But he did not let go, even after reaching his 100th hundred in 1973. Though he was sometimes left out of the Kent side, especially in one-day cricket, he was called up for his sixth Ashes tour in 1974-75 when an optimistic but ill-prepared England party suddenly ran into the hurricane-force of Lillee and Thomson."", 'England asked Cowdrey, then well into his 42nd year, if he would consider helping out. ""I\'d love to,"" he replied. Australian bewilderment was redoubled when, in the Second Test of that most virile of series, this rotund figure ambled towards the crease and introduced himself to Thomson: ""I don\'t believe we\'ve met. My name\'s Cowdrey"". But he played him as well as anyone else. He retired the following summer, but not before scoring 151 to lead Kent to a stunning win against the Australians at Canterbury. A few days later he played his last game against the Aussies, for MCC at Lord\'s - and made a pair. ""It was a vivid summarisation of his career,"" wrote Ivo Tennant, ""of the way cricket took him to the very heights and back again."" Though he played once in 1976, Colin was never able to take the field for Kent with his eldest son, Christopher, who was just about to break into the team, and later captained England once himself.', 'No one ever doubted Colin Cowdrey\'s cricketing ability. Fred Titmus has talked with awe about how, in dead county games, he would let John Murray behind the stumps nominate in advance the shot he would play: ""Amazing talent, done without showing off."" But there was always that enigmatic quality. Trevor Bailey said that he was too nice to demolish an attack truly, and that he worried too much. He certainly did worry. After his triumph at Melbourne in 1962-63, John Woodcock congratulated him and said he must be relieved it was all over, only to be told: ""Yes, but now there\'s the next one to worry about."" His character also caused some debate. Every cricket fan knew that Cowdrey walked when he thought he was out, and every prep school master thought this made him a hero. Professionals muttered darkly that he behaved differently on soft days in county cricket than at moments of crisis, banking on his reputation with umpires to get him through. ""He was not generally liked by cricketers,"" said Illingworth. This has to be balanced against the thousands of people - high and low - who were charmed by his kindness and thoughtfulness. The unanimous judgment, though, was that he was indecisive, a captain incapable of inspiring his players and so much a ditherer that he even had to be persuaded to go for the runs at Port-of-Spain on that great day in 1967-68.', ""His later life shed unexpected light on all these speculations. In 1978, he left his wife and went to live with Lady Herries, a daughter of the Duke of Norfolk, causing temporary rifts with his children. They later married and she became famous in her own right as a racehorse trainer. In 1986, after some years pottering inconsequentially doing PR for Barclays, Cowdrey became president of MCC for the bicentenary year. He turned this Buggins' turn sinecure into an improbable platform for dynamic change. He forced out the long-serving secretary, Jack Bailey, to end an institutionalised feud with the Test and County Cricket Board, and meanwhile made the first moves to sever the umbilical cord between the MCC and ICC, remaining as ICC chairman after giving up the presidency. It was possible to have differing views of Cowdrey's actions - pro-Bailey members voted down the committee report and accounts - but dithery they were not. In the midst of it all, he was forced to have a heart by-pass operation and missed the bicentenary match and banquet. He remained ICC chairman until 1993, seeing through the change that made it a serious international body rather than an imperial relic, and continued active - given his new life in the Norfolk family - in helping run Arundel cricket and at Kent, where Christopher and his brother, Graham, ensured there was a Cowdrey on the books until 1998: a 48-year span."", 'In retirement, his involvement was thus more successful than that of all the men preferred to him for on-field leadership: May, Dexter, and Illingworth all failed as chairman of selectors, and Smith was an absurdly invisible tour manager. Cowdrey\'s reputation as a kindly elder statesman grew and grew: he was knighted in 1992 and in 1997 became a life peer, the second cricketer after Learie Constantine to be elevated to the House of Lords. He enjoyed himself there but never quite bestrode the Lords in the way he bestrode Lord\'s: there turned out not to be time, and perhaps his non-cricketing destiny should have been as an ambassador rather than any kind of politician. His last great service was to initiate ""The Spirit Of Cricket"", the Preamble to the 2000 Code of Laws. Through his last years, he would often travel hundreds of miles to make beautifully crafted speeches to cricketing gatherings, expecting no money at all. ""He loved to be loved,"" said a friend, and perhaps a man, however great, needs reassurance forever when he spends seven years of childhood apart from his parents. He was loved. And the memory of him in later years - portly, a fraction stooped, his fey voice ever-solicitous about all-comers - will remain, almost as indelibly as the memory of him in his pomp: fairly portly even then, caressing the best bowlers\' finest efforts past cover as though it were the simplest trick in the world.

He responded with 6 for 77 in the second innings of England's thrilling, three-run victory at Melbourne, but he never reached those heights again, and his Test career was, perhaps surprisingly, over before he turned 25.

The bigger the stage, the better he has performed - provided the stage is in England, for he has had little success abroad except in South Africa in 1995-96. Since then he has lost the sting in his outswinger and become a seam-and-swing bowler for English conditions, bowling wicket to wicket, and launching into well-choreographed appeals for LBW. On the biggest stage in England, at Lord's, Cork took his best Test bowling figures of 7 for 43 in 1995, and played his most famous innings, in 2000, on both occasions against West Indies. His strength was his ability to move the ball late, although he suffered when he tried to bowl too fast, while his batting always promised more than it delivered.  \n"", 'The great promise he showed in those two series against West Indies was undermined by injury and off-the-field personal problems which prevented him ever becoming a fixture in the side. There were also accusations that he didn\'t always try as hard as he might - Geoff Boycott described him as a ""show pony"" during the 1996-97 tour of New Zealand. He was handed the captaincy of Derbyshire in 1999, and while he initially responded to a far from easy task with enthusiasm, reports of disharmony began to emerge and Cork appeared increasingly at odds with the management  It culminated in Cork buying his way out of his contract at the end of the 2003 season, and he subsequently joined Lancashire. ', ""Although he tried hard, he failed to really hit the heights expected of him during his first season at his new county, but played a vital role in Lancashire's promotion back to division one in 2005 with 43 wickets and 540 runs. He was never far away from the action during Lancashire's push for trophies and was involved in two near misses. The first came against Sussex in the 2006 C&G final and he was last-man out as Lancashire nearly pulled off an extraordinary run chase at the end of the 2007 Championship campaign. Despite being a regular in the four-day team he was released before the end of the season and found a new home at Hampshire."", ""It was another action-packed era of Cork's career during which he was elevated to captain and led Hampshire to a dramatic Twenty20 title in 2010 when they beat Somerset by losing few wickets on their home ground. The following summer the team reached Finals Day again and Cork was at the centre of more drama as he conceded just three from his final over against Somerset to secure a Super Over.

He wasn't especially eloquent, either. And his career encompassed its fair share of downs as well as ups. There were moments - such as in the latter stages of his time captaining England's ODI side or during the interminable fall-out of the Kevin Pietersen saga - when it seemed his love affair with his side's supporters could sour. "", 'In the end, though, his determination, his longevity, his decency and, yes, his sheer number of runs, shone through. And as The Oval crowd stood to give him ovation after ovation - the one that greeted his second-innings century lasted several minutes and held up play - the respect and popularity for him was abundantly clear. A knighthood - the first for an England cricketer since Sir Ian Botham in 2007 - followed a few months later. He continued to represent Essex.', ""In truth, Cook had been in decline as a batsman for some time. While still young - he was 33 when he played his final Test - there were many miles on the clock. He had already become his nation's highest run-scorer and century maker in Test cricket, he had also taken the most catches (as a non-keeper) and set a world record for the most Test caps in succession: an eye-watering 159."", 'Perhaps more pertinently, he appeared to never fully recover his spark after the Pietersen affair and the disappointment of losing the ODI captaincy on the eve of the 2015 World Cup. He had, he admitted, lost a ""bit of edge"" in the months before his retirement. While the occasional vast score - he made a double-century in his penultimate Ashes Test at Melbourne in 2017-18 - partially masked the decline, he reached 50 only twice in the 15 Tests before that Oval farewell. ', ""His career had, by then, encompassed some outrageous highs. The Ashes of 2010-11, for example, saw him amass 766 runs in seven innings to anchor England's first series win in Australia for 24 years. In so doing, he went past 5,000 Test runs, having turned 26 on Christmas Day - the second youngest batsman to reach the landmark after Sachin Tendulkar - and won the ICC's Test batsman of the year. Two years later and further records had been broken as he became England's leading Test century-maker - hitting No. 23 against India in Kolkata, his third in three matches - and the youngest player to pass 7,000 runs."", ""His finest captaincy moment may well have come near the start of his reign. The series victory in India in 2012-13 - England's first for 28 years - was testament not just to his outstanding batting, but also his willingness, at that point, to reintegrate Pietersen to the team despite considerable opposition. Two modest Australian teams were defeated in favourable English conditions in 2013 and 2015 - victory did not always silence grumbles about England's safety-first, regimented approach - and, in his final year in the job, South Africa fell too."", 'But there were significant disappointments, too. He led the side that was whitewashed in the 2013-14 Ashes and which subsequently descended into a power struggle over Pietersen. The coach, Andy Flower, resigned, Pietersen was banished, but Cook (who had been party to the decision over Pietersen) stayed on, only to be beaten by Sri Lanka in England the following summer when he almost resigned, such was the ferocity of the criticism on social media. Heartfelt applause at the Ageas Bowl for his painstaking 95 against India to end a desperately lean run was something he treasured.', ""His stubbornness was sometimes to his detriment. The apparently unquenchable self-belief, that helped turn a relatively limited player into England's record Test run-scorer, also convinced him that he was the man to revive England's ODI fortunes. As a result he lingered too long as captain of an outmoded side and was stung by the consequent criticism. While he led the team within an ace of that elusive global ODI title (the Champions Trophy of 2013), he was omitted from the 2015 World Cup squad, ending his limited-overs career around his 30th birthday. The change came too late to spare England a humiliating failure, but their improvement in the format thereafter was telling."", 'Cook\'s leadership was, in many ways, like his batting: unyielding, determined and deliberate, but lacking the spark of tactical genius. But his rock-like commitment to the cause, and high personal standards, were cause for considerable respect and gratitude. When he resigned as Test captain in the aftermath of a 4-0 trouncing by India in 2016, he was still only 32. His team, Pietersen apart, gave him great loyalty. Andrew Strauss, his predecessor as England captain and by then England\'s managing director, generously said he ""deserves to be looked upon as one of England\'s great captains.""', 'Twelve of his hundreds came as England captain (10 after he had won the job on a permanent basis), although he made only five in his last 48 Tests in charge, more symptomatic perhaps of the burdens he had to withstand rather than worsening technical deficiencies. His 24 Test wins in 59 Tests made him the joint second-most successful captain for England in terms of Test wins, behind Michael Vaughan, who had 26. His 22 defeats were also a record.', 'Those in the know were saying that the young Cook was destined for great things from early on. Cook was thrown in at the deep end by Essex the year after he left Bedford School with a fistful of batting records. He captained England in the Under-19 World Cup early in 2004, scored his maiden first-class hundred later that year, and added a double-century for Essex against the Australian tourists in 2005.', 'The following spring he was called up by the full England side when injuries struck in India. He had been in the Caribbean with the A team when the SOS came but, unfazed, stroked 60 and a magnificent century to complete a memorable debut in Nagpur. His ability to play long, attritional innings without showing signs of fatigue - it became a cliché that he did not sweat - was evident from the outset.', ""Bowlers began to exploit that penchant for hanging on the front foot, but Cook still made his share of runs. By the time of his 25th birthday on Christmas Day 2009 he had scored far more runs (3,536 to David Gower's 2,548) and centuries (nine to Ian Botham's six) than any other Englishman of a comparable age. He hit three more Test hundreds in 2009 - but none of them were in the Ashes series, in which 95 at Lord's was his only score above 32 as the Aussies probed that front-pad problem."", ""The Pakistan attack of 2010 caused ever more problems and probably took him as close to being dropped as at any time. But a century at The Oval, a gritty, gutsy innings, ensured he would open in the Ashes series in which he proved so decisive. It's probably a fair microcosm of his career: he never claimed to be the most talented, but somehow he found a way. And in taking on the fast bowlers and the new ball for a decade and more, without shrinking or shirking, he earned the respect in which he came to be held."", '\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006', 'Young Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in June 2011', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2012', 'Knighted in 2018']",161.0,291,16,12472.0,294,45.35,26562,46.95,33,57,1442,11,175.0,0.0,92.0,92,4,3204.0,137,36.4,4154,77.13,5,19,363,10,36.0,0.0,4.0,4,0,61.0,26,15.25,54,112.96,0,0,10,0,1.0,0.0,289.0,513,36,22604,294,47.38,44429,50.87,63,107,,,306.0,0.0,160.0,158,11,5851,137,39.80,7332,79.80,12,34,,,66.0,0.0,32.0,30,2,892,100*,31.85,699,127.61,1,5,95,15,13.0,0.0,161.0,2,18,7,1.0,1/6,1/6,7.0,2.33,18.0,0,0,0,92.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,4.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,289.0,,282,211,7,3/13,,30.14,4.48,40.2,0,0,0,160.0,,18,10,0,-,-,-,3.33,-,0,0,0,32.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

He might not share his relation's ability to entertain with the bat - few ever have - but he made his own career as a strong-willed top-order batsman with a correct technique that was highly enough regarded to win England Test caps. As introspective as his grandfather appeared relaxed, he alternated between obsessive commitment and disillusionment when his England career faltered before entering what had become a predictable retirement at the end of 2018. \n"", ""Selected to open the batting for England after a prolific domestic season in 2012, he didn't do too much wrong in nine Tests but England concluded Compton was not the man for the national side. His England career began in India in 2012. While his performances in a four-Test series in which England prevailed 2-1 were not a complete success, Compton's steady starts in spinning conditions left a feeling that he had potential to succeed. Just one half-century meant more was needed to cement his place in the side but he was kept on for the New Zealand tour and in the opening match in Dunedin made a second-innings century, a knock of immense determination. Another hundred in Wellington seemingly penned Compton into England's first-choice Test XI. But after a nervous time in the return series against the Black Caps, with much attention being placed on a strokeless innings at Headingley, Compton was dropped for the Ashes in part, at least, to accommodate Joe Root in an ill-fated experiment at the top of the order."", 'The attention placed on his supposedly inhibited approach made his return after two-and-a-half years, at 32, somewhat surprising and after a crisp and determined 85 in Durban in his comeback innings in the 2015 Christmas Test against South Africa, he failed to reach 50 in his other 12 knocks. The inevitability that he would be dropped once more after a dismal home Test series against Sri Lanka demotivated him and caused him to ask his county, Middlesex, for a leave of absence from the game. Middlesex spoke of a ""challenging start to the 2016 season, both physically and mentally"". There was talk of possible retirement, but he returned later in the season, although he played only a bit-part role in Middlesex\'s first Championship for 23 years.', 'Compton was raised in South Africa and honed an aptitude for sport, earning representative honours at tennis, football and hockey for Natal and holding down a single-figure golf handicap. He arrived in the UK as a teenager, attending Harrow School. ', 'He played for England Under-19s in 2001-02 but took some time to break through into the Middlesex side. Three Championship matches in 2004 brought little return but when his chance finally came again at the start of 2006 he made the most of it. He kicked off with a maiden hundred in the first game against Oxford University - sharing a 192 opening stand with another famous grandson, Ben Hutton - and then hit a hundred against Kent in the first Championship match of the summer.', ""But he grew increasingly frustrated with what he perceived as a lack of opportunities and moved to Somerset ahead of the 2010 season. It was a productive decision and he became a consistent scorer in a strong top order but it was in 2012 that he really caught the attention, when he came within a whisker of scoring 1,000 runs before the end of May. He was denied by the weather at New Road but in a season ruined by rain he finished with 1,494 at 99.60. It was enough to earn him a call-up for England's tour to India, replacing the retired Andrew Strauss as opener despite batting at No. 3 for Somerset. "", 'But most of 2013 and 2014 were also spent with Somerset. He carried on where he left off with 1,260 first-class runs at 45.00 and 1,034 at 43.08 respectively. Unfortunately for Compton, it seems the England selectors were no longer interested; a suspicion that was underlined when he was omitted from the Lions tour to South Africa that winter.', 'Struggling for equilibrium in the aftermath of the rejection, was allowed to leave Somerset with two years remaining of his contract in November 2014 and announced he would take a break from cricket to reassess his options and his future.

In the years after the war, when the British were still finding the joys of victory elusive, the exuberance of Compton's batting and personality became a symbol of national renewal. Almost single-handed (though his pal Bill Edrich helped), he ensured that cricket returned to its pre-war place in the nation's affections. Only Ian Botham has ever come remotely close to matching this achievement."", ' Compton was a remarkable batsman: loose-limbed with broad shoulders and powerful forearms. He could play all the strokes, though he rarely straight-drove. What made him special was his audacity: he would take risks, standing outside the crease even to quickish bowlers, challenging them to bowl anything other than the length he wanted. He took 622 wickets, mostly with his chinamen, and any other player might have turned this skill into a career; Compton regarded them as a bit of a party trick. His running between the wickets was never good, but it seemed to get worse after he retired and became the source of a thousand after-dinner jokes. In reality, it was never a disastrous weakness.', ""Denis Compton was born in Hendon, on May 23, 1918, and described his childhood as both  poorish and  happy. His father was a self-employed decorator who became a lorry driver when his business foundered. He was also a keen cricketer, as was Leslie, Denis's elder brother. They played against the lamp-posts in Alexandra Road and at Bell Lane Elementary School, and Compton's talent was obvious at once. At 12, he was playing for his father's team, and North London Schools against South London Schools at  Lord's. He made 88. Two years later, watched by Sir Pelham Warner, he made 114 at  Lord's for the Elementary Schools against C. F. Tufnell's XI and led his team to a crushing victory. He joined the Lord's staff in 1933, and three years later got a game for the county, as an 18-year-old against  Sussex in the Whitsun match.  Compton batted at No. 11: he scored 14 in an important last-wicket stand with Gubby Allen that gave  Middlesex first-innings points; the umpire Bill Bestwick supposedly said later that he only gave Compton lbw because he was desperate for a pee."", ""Next match he was No. 8 and facing  Larwood with confidence. Then he was No. 7, scoring 87 against  Northamptonshire. In one game, the captain Walter Robins came down the pitch after he had driven a fast bowler for two consecutive fours.  You know what to look out for now, don't you? No, skipper. Well, he'll bounce one at you. If he does, I shall hook him. And he did - into the Mound Stand. Before June was out he scored a hundred, in an hour and three-quarters, at Northampton. By the time the season was over and he had passed a thousand runs, Warner, then chairman of the Test selectors, called him  the best young batsman who has come out since Walter Hammond was a boy.  "", 'But Compton had no time to relax. In September he made his Football League debut for Arsenal on the left wing against Derby County, scored the opening goal in a 2-2 draw, and was called  the success of the afternoon by the ', "". Soon he was being marked out as a future England footballer as well as cricketer, despite criticism, which Compton always accepted, that he was inclined to prefer pretty ball-play to anything else. In cricket, the golden youth's progress turned out to be stoppable only by the Germans. In  1937 he scored 1,980 runs and was picked by  England against  New Zealand at  the Oval. He scored 65 and was  run out, flukily, while backing up. That year, as Pasty Hendren retired, Bill Edrich qualified for Middlesex. Len Hutton also made his Test debut. Thus started both the great partnership and the great rivalry that were to dominate post-war cricket. The contrast between the serious-minded  Hutton and the insouciant  Compton would be the great divide in English cricket for years, and small boys of all ages invariably inclined to one or the other."", ""Next time  Compton batted for  England, against  Australia at  Trent Bridge in  1938, he made 102; then came a match-saving yet exuberant 76 not out at  Lord's. But he contributed just a single when Hutton scored his 364 at  The Oval.  Compton preferred to play football rather than tour  South Africa- the 10-day Test at  Durban would not have suited him - but in  1939 was back to top cricketing form, scoring 2,468 runs, including 120 against  West Indies at  Lord's, when he put on 248 with  Hutton in two hours 20 minutes. There is no telling what this generation of batsmen might have achieved had they not been so rudely interrupted. Possibly, in the absence of equally compelling bowlers, they might have got bored. They never had the chance to find out. Soon Compton was a special constable and then a member of the Royal Artillery, posted first to East Grinstead which still allowed the chance of weekend football. (He won 12 wartime and Victory match football caps for England, which did not officially count, but many contemporaries agreed that he was now the best outside-left in the country.) In 1944 he was sent to India as a sergeant-major supposedly in charge of getting men fit to defeat Japan; his lenient approach to this task enhanced his popularity with the men, and the Allies still won the war. He was able to fit in 17 first-class matches in  India as well. His performances included a century for  East Zone against the  Australian Services, which was interrupted by rioters for several minutes when he was in the nineties. The line  Mr. Compton, you very good player but the game must stop became one of the catch-phrases of his friendship with Keith Miller, which ended only with Compton's death. Compton also appeared, in the casual manner of that era, in the extraordinary Ranji Trophy final of  1944-45, then the highest-scoring match ever, between  Holkar and  Bombay."", ' Compton struggled at first in 1946, and his first 12 months of post-war cricket are sometimes thought of as a failure. He was still the leading scorer with 2,403 runs in  1946, and made a hundred in each innings at the  Adelaide Test the following February.', ""Because Compton had been touring, he missed that icy, fuel-rationed winter which for many people in Britain was tougher than anything produced by the war. Thus the stage was set for the greatest cricket season any individual has ever had. Compton did not really hit form until the season was a month old, and did not emerge into his full glory until the sun came out, and the series against South Africa began. He scored 753 of his 3,816 runs that summer in the Tests. But somehow, in the mind's eye of a generation, he was always batting at Lord's in a county match: hair tousled, the ball racing past cover point or backward of square. An exile in Australia complained:  I hardly expected him to score 18 hundreds in a season. I thought him too good a player for that sort of thing. He was assured that Compton had just played his natural game and the centuries - like his aggregate, a record for any season - had been almost incidental. Even more incidentally,  Compton and  Edrich took  Middlesex to the Championship. The only cloud in that perfect summer came in the very last county match at  Lord's:  Compton had to retire to the pavilion because of knee trouble. He came out to make a  second-innings\ncentury, another against the  South Africans, and a further 246 - the knee strapped - for  Middlesex against  The Rest at  The Oval."", ""But from then on the words Compton and knee were to go together almost as easily as Compton and Edrich. Apparently, it was first damaged in a collision with Charlton goalkeeper Sid Hobbins in 1938, but it now became increasingly troublesome to him, and a constant source of worry for the public too. There were still many great innings - two big Test hundreds in  1948 against Bradman's invincible  Australians, an astounding 300 in three hours against an admittedly weak  North-Eastern Transvaal team a few months later - but they came less certainly. As a cricketer his zenith had been so high that the only possible way was down. He was, however, now much more than a cricketer. On the  1948-49 tour of  South Africa, he approached the journalist Reg Hayter with a suitcase full of unopened letters. Hayter started to go through them and found one from the "", "" offering £2,000 a year for a weekly column. Then he found another, written a few months later, withdrawing the offer because there had been no reply. Hayter introduced Compton to Bagenal Harvey, who became the first sportsman's agent, and did the famous deal in which Compton slicked down his hair and became forever identified with Brylcreem."", ""In the spring of 1950 he was still able to come out of footballing semi-retirement, get into the Arsenal team during their FA Cup run and get a winner's medal at Wembley, where they beat Liverpool 2-0. But in the Whitsun game against Sussex, his knee gave way and he missed much of that summer. He failed horribly in the Tests in Australia in the winter. In May  1951, after being appointed joint captain of  Middlesex with  Edrich, he scored 909 runs, more than in May  1947, but  Compton's knee was by now entering national folklore, his appearances were becoming curtailed, and his ambition less intense. The runs still kept coming: he made the hit that won the Ashes in  1953, and in  1954, against  Pakistan, there came both his highest Test score, 278 at  Trent Bridge, and the innings he was inclined to regard as his best, 53 on a wet pitch at  The Oval. He scored 492 in the  1955 Tests against  South Africa. That November he had his right kneecap removed; his surgeon kept it as a souvenir, before giving it to  MCC as part of the  Lord's archive.  Compton's biographer, Tim Heald, examined it and reported that it was like  a medium-sized mushroom, honey-coloured and honey-combed."", 'The operation enabled him to carry on playing for another two seasons, and to tour  South Africa in  1956-57. He left county cricket as triumphantly as he entered it, hitting 143 in three hours in his final match as a professional for  Middlesex in  1957. Thereafter he made occasional appearances as an amateur, scored his 123rd first-class hundred for the Cavaliers on a sociable trip to  Jamaica in January  1964, and finally bowed out with a fifty for  MCC against  Lancashire later that year.', 'By then, he had become a thoroughly successful ex-cricketer, commentating for the BBC, writing pieces for the ', "" that were usually absurdly optimistic about the talents of iffy young cricketers, and using his natural readiness to have a drink and a chat with anyone to win accounts (successfully) for advertising agencies, first Royds then McCanns. He remained a bit of a roisterer into old age and maintained the friendships of his playing days until death. Edrich and Miller were at the top of this list; but it extended to all the South Africans he had found such chivalrous opponents and generous hosts. This led him to take the pro-white South Africa side in the disputes that followed his retirement and to be used on occasion - such as the 1983 debate over sending an MCC team to South Africa - by those with dubious motives. He never lost the slightly chaotic ingenuousness that was responsible for the suitcase of letters: he was always unpunctual and would arrive, as Michael Parkinson put it, in a cloud of dust even when he was walking with a stick. His home life was successful only serially, but his third and last wife provided two daughters to add to his earlier families, which helped keep him young. He was always young at heart, even towards the end when the pain from his hip merged with the pain from his knee. He died in hospital at Windsor on St. George's Day, following complications from his third hip operation. His memorial service at Westminster Abbey created more applications for tickets than any in 30 years. Cricket was hugely fortunate that such a gifted sportsman graced the game with his presence. It was doubly blessed that he was a man of modesty, charm and good nature.""]","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1939', 'Played professional football for Arsenal (FA Cup winner 1950) and represented England in wartime internationals']",78.0,131,15,5807.0,278,50.06,,,17,28,,3,49.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,515.0,839,88,38942,300,51.85,,,123,183,,,416.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78.0,66,2710,1410,25.0,5/70,5/77,56.4,3.12,108.4,0,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,515.0,,36640,20074,622,7/36,,32.27,3.28,58.9,,19,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

5 ft 11 in ",,Allrounder,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"['\nPaul Collingwood was never the most gifted cricketer to play for England, but there was so much to admire for all that. That he was a cricketer of substance was undeniable. As his county career came to an end in 2018, at the age of 42, he symbolised how much could be achieved by pluck, good sense and a deal of athleticism.  \n', 'A natural athlete with a happy-go-lucky temperament, Collingwood became the first England captain to ever deliver a global tournament when England beat Australia to win the 2010 World Twenty20. It was reward for nine years of uncomplaining professionalism, in which time he fought his way through a melee of seemingly more talented opponents to make himself indispensable in all forms of the game.', ""It took a long time to prise out Collingwood from the middle. More than seven years after the end of his England career, he retired with quite a record: he represented Durham in 23 of their 26 years in professional cricket and amassed 304 first-class appearances, 16,844 runs and 164 wickets.\nIn common with Marcus Trescothick at Somerset, he grew into one of the grand old stagers of the county circuit, communicating that England's professional circuit remained a place where international stars who had known the best could still find satisfaction. A phlegmatic, hard-working, get-the-job-done cricketer, he squeezed value from himself to the very last drop.\nHe called time on his England Test career at the end of the 2010-11 Ashes series, finishing on a high by becoming a three-times Ashes winner, and by the time he ended his ODI career two months later, he was England's leading ODI run scorer and most capped player. But his contribution was far from spent: he went on to lead Durham to the Championship in 2013 and his growing reputation as one of England's old sages was amplified when he accepted a part-time coaching role with Scotland and guided them to the World Cup finals. An opportunity working as England's fielding coach under Ashley Giles began his gradual shift in the later stages of his career from player to coach."", ""Collingwood's greatest asset was his ability to contribute to the team in several aspects. As a batsman, he stands still at the crease, plays the ball straight and has a tantalising range of strokes up his sleeve. His bowling verged towards the dibbly-dobbly, but given the right conditions he could be irresistible, as he proved with a matchwinning display of swing bowling in the third one-day game against New Zealand in 2001-02. As a fielder, he was one of the finest in the world, capable of breathtaking moments in the covers and backward point. The final tick in his column was his determination, which made him go to Melbourne in the winter of 2000-01 to play grade cricket when he realised he was treading water."", ""For the first few years in his international career he seemed destined to be a fill-in player. But at Lahore in the winter of 2005, he stuck 96 and 80 before hitting a brilliant maiden century at Nagpur with England in the middle of an injury crisis. He kicked on to become the rock of England's batting on the subsequent Ashes tour. His brilliant double-century at Adelaide ought to have been the defining moment of his career. Instead it was the preamble to one of the most devastating defeats in English Test history. But after an understandable period of introspection, Collingwood bounced back with consecutive one-day centuries to secure the CB Series. It was England's first overseas one-day trophy for nine years, and his subsequent appointment to the captaincy in June 2007 was met with unanimous approval. He cemented the role with memorable victories over India at home and Sri Lanka away."", ""A slump in form in 2008 led to his omission from the Test team and his resignation as ODI captain, but he took back the reins for the World Twenty20 in 2009, a decision that didn't look too prudent when England were embarrassed by the Netherlands in the opening match of the tournament. But less than a year later England had developed into a ruthless power-packed Twenty20 side. Led by Collingwood, their blend of fearless hitting with dynamite fielding and thoughtful bowling brushed aside all challenges as England won the tournament. They got there in style - beating Australia in the final - with Collingwood finishing the job with the winning runs."", ""A difficult summer followed, where Collingwood struggled to come to terms with the seam and swing of Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif. His batting form failed to improve during England's historic Ashes success the winter after but his fielding remained exemplary - setting the benchmark for England's high standards. In the final Ashes Test in Sydney he dismissed Michael Hussey in the first innings, sparking wild celebrations. And with England on the verge of a 3-1 triumph, he chose to retire from Test cricket, calling time on a successful Test career which many thought would never happen. He had hoped to keep playing limited-overs cricket for England but a poor World Cup followed the Ashes and he was subsequently dropped from both England's teams and replaced as Twenty20 captain by Stuart Broad."", 'After considering retirement from all cricket, he decided to continue with Durham and succeeded Phil Mustard as captain in 2012, winning an impressive seven of his first 10 matches at the helm as steering Durham from bottom of the table to safety. A Championship title duly followed in 2013 as he reinvigorated Durham in a manner few seriously expected. When some bad investments made life harder in 2014 he still led Durham to the Royal London One-Day Cup and picked up the Player of the Year award for good measure. He had become a wonderful ambassador for county cricket, but Durham were stricken by financial problems and when the ECB was forced to bail them out, as a last resort, at the end of 2016 they did so with stringent penalties - relegation from Division One of the Championship included - intended to give a warning message to others. Collingwood termed it ""a kick in the nuts"", but Durham could also learn from his ability to squeeze maximum benefit from the toughest situations.', ""That relegation brought a rush of departures, but while Collingwood was still standing there was still hope. He made 1,000 Championship runs in 2017 and became the oldest player to make a T20 hundred and Durham's first century-maker in that format, against Worcestershire at New Road.  Aged 41 years & 65 days, Collingwood beat ex-Worcestershire player Graeme Hick (41y 37d) who struck 110 against Northamptonshire in 2007. A rush of Durham awards followed. A season later, with the county showing signs of recovery, he felt able to call time."", '\n']",['Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005'],68.0,115,10,4259.0,206,40.56,9170,46.44,10,20,470,24,96.0,0.0,197.0,181,37,5092.0,120*,35.36,6614,76.98,5,26,365,74,108.0,0.0,36.0,33,2,583.0,79,18.80,459,127.01,0,3,37,24,15.0,0.0,306.0,527,52,16938,206,35.65,,,35,85,,,352.0,0.0,428.0,401,73,11240,132,34.26,,,10,65,,,207.0,0.0,148.0,131,16,2478,108*,21.54,2040,121.47,1,9,167,86,49.0,0.0,68.0,59,1905,1018,17.0,3/23,3/35,59.88,3.20,112.0,0,0,0,197.0,151,5186,4294,111.0,6/31,6/31,38.68,4.96,46.7,3,1,0,36.0,20,234,347,16.0,4/22,4/22,21.68,8.89,14.6,1,0,0,306.0,,12706,6396,166,5/52,,38.53,3.02,76.5,,2,0,428.0,,11482,9228,273,6/31,6/31,33.80,4.82,42.0,5,1,0,148.0,108,1852,2245,99,5/6,5/6,22.67,7.27,18.7,4,2,0,False,True,False,True

Close\'s courage, batting against the fastest bowling or fielding at short leg, was legendary. Seemingly impervious to pain himself, he used to say to anyone who flinched, or rubbed a bruise: ""How can the ball hurt you? It\'s only on you for a second."" On the one known occasion when he was hit by such force that he was knocked off his feet - by a short-arm pull by Hampshire\'s Danny Livingstone at Portsmouth - Close, sprang up and dismissed the slips and wicketkeeper (who were running towards him in concern) with an angry wave. Because he always tried to play the type of innings he considered the position of the match required, Close\'s record did scant justice to his talent, which was huge. He was a notably unselfish cricketer, a factor in the respect he won as Yorkshire, Somerset, and briefly, England captain, and the success his teams enjoyed. He was as stubborn as he was unselfish, however, and invariably found a pretext for a dismissal through some outlandish stroke. One from which the Yorkshire dressing-room derived most pleasure came when he was caught off a snow-gathering top-edge as he tried to pull John Price, the Middlesex fast bowler, into the Warner Stand at Lord\'s: ""I had it covered for everything but uneven bounce,"" was Close\'s indignant explanation.', ' \n', ""\nOf legendary toughness, Brian Close still holds the record for the youngest player to represent England, when, after a superb allround first season with Yorkshire, he was picked to play against New Zealand in 1949 at the age of 18. He never fully realised the promise of that first season, in and out of the England side over the next 27 years. Batting left, and bowling right-handed, he completed the double in 1949, the youngest player to do so. As a batsman he could defend with great obduracy, but could attack thrillingly, although not always wisely. He bowled medium-pace and offspin, with more consistency than his batting. He lost favour with the England selectors after trying to hit Benaud out of the attack in the 1961 Old Trafford Test, but returned to take England to the brink of victory in the 1963 Lord's Test against the West Indies. In this innings, his highest in Tests, he used unconventional tactics, coming up the wicket to the West Indies pace bowlers. He captained Yorkshire and England with success, but lost the England position after using delaying tactics in a county game. Later internal politics saw him move from Yorkshire to Somerset for the final years of his career. He was famous for his fearless fielding at short leg, where he would rarely duck or move to avoid a hard hit ball.  He was also known for his courage against fast bowling, memorably so in 1976, when he was recalled at the age of 45 to face the fearsome West Indies pace trio of Holding, Roberts and Daniel. Subjected to a barrage of short-pitched bowling on the Saturday of the Old Trafford Test in less than favourable light, Close never flinched,\nand, as always, refused to rub the bruises when hit.  In later years he played in the Lancashire League then returned to Yorkshire, and much controversy as chair of the cricket committee.

He had been in ill-health for some years. An adventurous batsman, superlative fielder and brilliant captain, he was the embodiment of the debonair amateur who became\nthe idol of cricket crowds, nonchalantly aggressive on the field and warmly convivial off it. \n', ""He was born at Reading on September 3, 1900, and was educated at Oakham and Uppingham, where his talents as an outstanding schoolboy cricketer soon brought him to the fore. He was in the Uppingham XI for four years (1916-19), in the last two years captaining the side and playing in the representative matches at\nLord's. At the age of only 16 he played an innings of 206 not out for his school and averaged 111.33 for the season, and in 1919 also headed the Uppingham bowling averages, so that by the time he went up to Pembroke, Cambridge, he was already a player of some experience as well as distinction."", ""Despite the strength of Cambridge cricket in 1920, Chapman at once became a member of the XI and began his first-class career with a chanceless 118 against, Essex at Fenner's, gaining his blue as a Freshman and appearing for the Gentlemen at both Lord's and Scarborough: in the latter match he made a brilliant 101. In 1922 he scored a dazzling 102 not out against Oxford, and\nfollowed it a few days later with 160 for the Gentlemen against Players at Lord's: he completed a brilliant triology when he made 121 in the Lord's Test against Australia in 1930, thus becoming the first and only player to score a century at Lord's for his University, the Gentlemen, and for England. Whilst at Cambridge he played for his native Berkshire in the Minor Counties\nchampionship and, on qualifying for Kent, made his Championship debut for them in 1925."", ""Chapman brought his own sparkling brand of cricket to the first-class game. His left-handed batting was daring and aggressive, always bold with attacking strokes, and able to turn many a match with 4 whirlwind burst of hitting. Whilst he often took risks; he could also play classically: his drive through the covers was as graceful as it was powerful. He was a huge, robust figure, standing 6 feet 3 inches, with a tremendous vitality for the game. His capacious hands made him a brilliant close-to-the-wicket fielder, and some of his catches were miraculous: he caught Bradman in both innings of the Test match at Lord's in 1930 with catches that are still spoken of. He had made his Test debut in 1924 against South Africa, but his greatest moment came in 1926 when, as a surprise choice, he was made captain against Australia in the vital last Test at the Oval, on which depended the Ashes. He was confident of victory, and\nled England to a resounding triumph amid great rejoicing. He captained England in 17 Tests, of which only two were lost, and led England on the successful\ntour of Australia in 1928-29: he had previously toured down-under with A. E. R. Gilligan's side four years earlier, and had been to Australasia under A. C.\nMacLaren in 1922-23. He ended his Test career by captaining England in South Africa in 1930-31. Altogether in his 26 Tests he scored 925 runs at an average of 28.90 and took 32 catches. He also visited Jamaica with Lord Tennyson's side early in 1932."", ""To Kent cricket he brought much glory between the wars. He captained the side from 1931 to 1936, and he formed with Frank Woolley and Leslie Ames a trio that\nbrought large crowds to watch Kent play. The highest of his 27 first-class centuries was scored against Lancashire at Maidstone in 1927 - a wonderful innings of 260 scored in just over three hours against the County Champion's bowling, when he hit five 6s and thirty-three 4s and hit his last 60 in a quarter of an hour. On that occasion he and G. B. Legge, after five Kent wickets had fallen for 70, added 284 in 2J hours, still the record for Kent's sixth wicket and the highest partnership ever recorded on the Mote ground.

May 21, 1893, Mickleham, Surrey ","February 7, 1963, West Witton, Yorkshire (aged 69 years 262 days) ",,"['England,', 'Nottinghamshire']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"[""\nArthur Carr, who died at Leyburn, Yorkshire, on February 7, personified the South countryman's idea of a Northern cricket captain. This, however, was a matter of character rather than heredity, for he was the son of a London stockbroker, was born in Surrey and went to school at Sherborne. Tall, wide-shouldered, with a high forehead, eyes constantly narrowed - as if in appraisal - strong mouth and firm jaw, he took his cricket grimly, as though it satisfied some hugely combative streak in him. Unwavering once he had taken a decision, he was never one to suffer fools gladly, nor a believer in the soft answer to turn away wrath. He went out of first-class cricket rather than change his opinion. Arthur Carr was one of the three finest batsmen ever produced by Sherborne: oddly enough, he was captain of every game there except cricket;\nbut he was good enough batsman to be given a match for Nottinghamshire in 1910, a year before he left school. He scored his first county century in 1913, but his effective first-class cricketing career began when he became captain of Nottinghamshire in 1919. His captaincy had the firm foundation of playing ability. He was a fierce straight driver, at his most spectacular\nagainst pace bowling. He would step down the wicket to hit men as fast as\nJ. M. Gregory and Maurice Tate back over their heads: indeed, Maurice\nTate once said that Arthur Carr hit him consistently harder than any\nother batsman he ever met. But, unlike many who excel against pace,\nCarr was sound against flight and spin, and regularly made good scores\nagainst the best spin attacks of his day. He had, moreover, a sound defence,\nfor he played very straight and used his feet well. In a career spread over\ntwenty-five years, he scored 21,100 runs with 45 centuries, made a thousand\nruns in each of eleven seasons and averaged, overall, 31.58. Fielding with\nhostile concentration near the wicket - slip, gully or short-leg - he took 316\ncatches. But it is as a captain that Arthur Carr is most memorable. Decisive,\nrelentless, compelling respect from his own players and from his opponents.\nDuring the sixteen years of his captaincy, Nottinghamshire won the Championship for only the second time since 1886, were nine times in the first four\nand never held a double-figure position. They have not approached that standard\nsince Carr went. Wisden once referred to his Notts team as `Mr. Carr and the professionals who support him so well'. For years the only amateur in the side, he had either to remain aloof, in the manner of Lord Hawke, or, cutting across\nthe etiquette of the time, mix in completely with his professionals. Carr\ntook the latter course, proved as hard, and as hard a drinker, as any of them, but never lost a scrap of his authority. He was an aggressive captain. He\nwas fortunate that, throughout his career, he had invariably had three\nfast bowlers - of Matthews, Barratt, Larwood, Voce, Butler and Flint -\nin the side. He used them in short spells, flat out, to attacking fields,\nwith immense effect. Carr played for England throughout the series in South Africa, 1922-23 and, in 1926, captained England in the first four Tests against Australia. At Leeds, where the selectors - not Carr - left out Charles Parker on a wet wicket, he won the toss and put Australia in to bat. Bardsley was\ncaught at slip, off Tate, from the first ball of the match: off the fifth\nball of the same over, Carr dropped Macartney, or Australia would have\nbeen 2 for 2 wickets. In the event, Macartney scored a century before lunch and the second wicket put on 235. During the fourth - Old Trafford - Test, Carr became ill with tonsilitis: although he had recovered in time for the final Test - in which England recovered The Ashes - the captaincy was given to Percy\nChapman.  Carr was bitterly disappointed at being deposed and, although he was\nmade a Test selector in 1928 and captained England in two Tests with\nSouth Africa in 1929, he threw his main energies into driving Nottinghamshire up the Championship table.  Neither Douglas Jardine nor Arthur Carr are alive to relate precisely the genesis of the tactic variously described as `fast leg-theory', `direct attack' or, as it is now remembered, 'bodyline'. But certainly it was a product of a discussion between those two, for, under Arthur Carr's direction, Voce and Larwood employed - and perfected -  the method in English county cricket during 1932, before the controversial tour which effectively ended the career of more than one of the participants. In 1934, a section of the crowd at Trent Bridge demonstrated against the Australians, on behalf of their two local bowlers, whom they believed to have been ill-treated. Arthur Carr stood, uncompromisingly, with Larwood, Voce and their supporters.\nBitter dissention within the club led to the captaincy being taken from\nhim. He accepted membership of the committee and declared himself available for the county in 1935: but he never played for Nottinghamshire again.  Instead, he moved to Yorkshire and turned to his other major interest, horse-racing: for some years he had horses in training at Middleham. Arthur Carr virtually cut himself off from the cricket world until recent years, when the old bitterness had grown less sharp, and he would turn up at Trent Bridge, as a welcome\nguest, at Test Match time. There is little doubt that he enjoyed himself,\nbut he maintained a public front of tight-lipped and cold-eyed withdrawal:\nhe never believed in showing sentiment.\n"", ' \n', 'Arthur William Carr, who collapsed and died after shovelling snow at his home at West Witton, Yorkshire, on February 7, aged 69, was a celebrated Nottinghamshire and England captain. Born at Mickleham, Surrey, he was educated at Sherborne where he was captain of every game except cricket. Nevertheless he earned an early reputation as a cricketer. He headed the School averages in 1910 with 638 runs at 45.47 per innings and took with fast bowling 32 wickets for 15.06 runs each; the following year, with the aid of an innings of 224, he averaged 62. While still at school he made a few appearances for Nottinghamshire and in 1913, at the age of 18, he gave a display of that strong-driving, attacking play which always characterised his cricket when he hit 169 against Leicestershire at Trent Bridge. He and G. M. Lee (200 not out) shared in a stand of 333 in just over three hours.', ""Not till he took over the captaincy in 1919--a position he occupied till 1934, when he gave up, following a heart attack--did he occupy a regular place in the county eleven. Then, with improved judgement allied to his forcing methods, he became a highly valuable batsman. In each of eleven seasons he exceeded 1,000 runs, his most successful being that of 1925 when, with the help of seven centuries, including his highest--206 against Leicestershire at Leicester--he aggregated 2,338 runs with an average of 51.95. That summer he hit no fewer than forty-eight 6's. During his first-class career he made 21,884 runs, average 31.12, took 28 wickets at 38.17 apiece and, an exceptionally alert fieldsman anywhere near the wicket, held 361 catches."", ' Carr played for England on eleven occasions. He toured South Africa under F. T. Mann in 1922-23, taking part in all five Test matches; he led his country in four games against Australia in 1926 till he was superseded by A. P. F. Chapman at the Oval--a decision which aroused much controversy--and in 1929 he was recalled to the leadership for the last two matches with South Africa, replacing J. C. White, captain in the first three. In thirteen Test innings he hit 237 runs, with a top score of 63 at Johannesburg, average 19.75. He made a number of appearances for Gentlemen against Players between 1919 and 1929.', 'Of somewhat stern appearance, but kind and generous at heart and a lover of cricket, Carr was a man of forthright views. He was specially outspoken in defence of H. Larwood and W. Voce, his team-mates who were principals in the body-line tour of Australia in 1932-33. During his long reign as captain he led Nottinghamshire to first place among the counties in 1929--the last time they headed the Championship.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1923'],11.0,13.0,1.0,237.0,63,19.75,,,0.0,1.0,,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,468.0,709,42,21051,206,31.56,,,45,98,,,395.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,468.0,,1816,1150,31,3/14,,37.09,3.79,58.5,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

But under Nasser Hussain and Duncan Fletcher, Caddick flourished, and formed a strong partnership with Darren Gough that lasted 25 Tests, faltered only during the 2001 Ashes drubbing, and was finally broken when both men decided not to go to India in November 2001. Caddick left his decision until the last  minute.  Although in the international wilderness, he continued to plug away for Somerset with good results.

Ill-health limited his first-class career to eight seasons, but in that time he scored 15,485 runs, including 50 centuries, at an average of 49.95. A remarkably good slip fieldsman, he brought off 256 catches. ""Duleep"" or ""Mr. Smith,"" as he was affectionately known in cricketing circles, was in the Cheltenham XI from 1921 to 1923, and when captain in the last year headed the batting figures with an average of 52.36, his highest innings being 162. He also met with considerable success as a leg-break bowler, and in 1922 was top of the averages with 50 wickets at 13.66 runs each, but he rarely bowled after leaving school. During this time HS  Altham, the present President of MCC, wrote of him in ', ': ""In natural gifts of eye, wrist and footwork he is certainly blest far above the ordinary measure... there is no doubt about the judgment and certainty with which he takes toll of straight balls of anything but the most immaculate length. His late cutting is quite beautiful and there is a certain ease and maturity about all his batting methods that stamps him as of a different class from the ordinary school batsman."" The accuracy of this estimate of his qualities was borne out when in 1925 he went up to Cambridge. He got his Blue as a Freshman, scoring 75 in the University match, and also played against Oxford in 1926 and 1928. Illness kept him out of the side for most of the 1927 season. \n', ""His career with Sussex, whom he captained in 1932, began in 1926 and he headed the county averages in every season until 1932, when doctors advised him not to take further part in cricket.

His one tour abroad was with the MCC team in New Zealand and Australia in 1929-30, when he scored more runs than any other member of the side. A. H. H. Gilligan, the captain, rated him the best player of slow bowling on a wet pitch that he ever saw.

He was 54, and though he died comparatively young he lived longer than was at one time thought likely; for his life was clouded by illness which forced\nhim more than once to lay aside his cricket and finally caused a premature retirement from the game at the early age of 27."", 'Yet in the brief career that he was able to enjoy; he proved himself an artist with the bat, an enchanting batsman of impeccable technique, as elegant as he was successful, and revealing an innate quality of batsmanship to the most\nsearching connoisseur.', 'Prince Duleepsinhji was born in India on June 13, 1905,and as a nephew of the famous Ranjitsinhji, it was as if he were destined from birth for greatness on the cricket field. He was sent for his education to England and made his mark as a player of distinction while still a boy at Cheltenham College, where he was in the XI from 1921 to 1923, being considered the best schoolboy batsman of the year in his final season when he was captain: he then played an innings of 108 for Lord\'s Schools against the Rest, and: his prowess, not unnaturally, so delighted his uncle that Ranji approached Sussex with a view that his nephew might appear for his former county. In the following year, 1924, Duleep made his debut in first-class cricket and played his first match for Sussex, thus beginning his brief but glorious career, in which his genuine charm as a man was as much a feature as his brilliant merits as a cricketer. He was universally popular throughout his playing days and was affectionately known as ""Smith,"" and for all the adulation that was heaped upon him he remained essentially modest and retiring, revelling much more in a well-played innings of 30 than in a centuryof easy acquisition.', ""It was the word and reputation of his uncle that he revered in particular, and he considered his own batting-gifted as it was-a mere shadow of that of the great Ranji: Sussex, indeed, were fortunate in possessing both of these batsmen, each at the height of his power. Duleepsinhji played for Cambridge from 1925 until 1928, but it was during his university career that illness first struck at his cricket. Early in 1927 he scored the highest innings ever made for Cambridge  - 254 not out against Middlesex at Fenner's-following which he fell seriously ill and played no more that season. Suffering from a pulmonary disease, he was obliged to spend the winter in Switzerland. he returned to England, and with restored health was a more formidable batsman than ever."", 'In each of the seasons from 1928 to 1931 he increased his aggregate, exceeding 2,500 runs in each of the last three years.      In 1929 he was chosen to play in the first of his 12 Test matches for England, and in the winter of that year visited Australia and New Zealand under his Sussex captain, A. H. H. Gilligan.    At Hastings in 1929 he performed one of the most outstanding feats in county cricket by taking 115 and 246 off the Kent attack, both innings being scored at well over a run a minute.', ""In 1930, a golden year for him, his feats were memorable indeed. In his first innings that year at Hove, he established a ground record with a magnificent 333 scored in a single day against Northamptonshire - the biggest score ever made for Sussex, exceeding the record of his uncle. At Lord's in 1930 his performances were quite phenomenal. For Sussex against Middlesex he scored a century in each innings and in the following month repeated the feat for the Gentlemen against Players.

He made his debut a year later and ended his first-class career, perhaps prematurely, in 1938. He took up journalism, but hardly had time to establish himself before war broke out in 1939. Then he spent spells in hotel management and farming before his post-war career, which included journalism, broadcasting, and acting as baggage-master and scorer to M.C.C. teams abroad, and for touring countries here. He also took Commonwealth sides to India.', 'Duckworth received a trial with Warwickshire before arousing the interest of his native county with whom he quickly showed his talent by the confident manner in which he kept to such varied and demanding bowlers as the Australian fast bowler, E. A. McDonald, and the spin of C. H. Parkin and R. Tyldesley. By 1924 he had gained the first of 24 Test caps for England, a total which undoubtedly would have been much higher but for the competition of L. E. G. Ames of Kent, who in the 1930s usually gained preference because of his batting prowess. In his later days with Lancashire, Duckworth also faced strong competition from Farrimond, which he resisted successfully.', 'In Test cricket, Duckworth claimed 59 wicketkeeping victims, and he also hit 234 runs, with 39 not out as his highest. For Lancashire his number of victims was a record 921, and his highest score 75. In all first-class matches he helped in 1,090 dismissals, 751 catches and 339 stumpings. He dismissed 107 batsmen, 77  caught and 30 stumped, in his best season, 1928.', 'That season completed three Championship successes for  Lancashire, captained by Leonard Green, who described  Duckworth as ""one of the smallest, but noisiest of all cricketing artists -- a man born to squat behind the wicket and provide good humour and unbounded thrills day by day in many a glorious summer"".', 'Lancashire won the Championship again in 1930, and 1934, so that Duckworth gained the honour of being a member of five championship teams. In 1949-50 Duckworth, a man of administrative ability, took his first Commonwealth team to India, Pakistan and Ceylon, and repeated the successful venture in 1950-51 and 1953-54. Then followed his duties as baggage-master and scorer, at home and abroad, where his jovial personality, wise counsel and experience were of benefit to many a team and individual cricketer. His radio and television commentaries, typically humorous and forthright, became well-known, both on cricket and on Rugby League, in which game he was a devoted follower of Warrington.', 'Among many tributes were:', 'H. Sutcliffe (Yorkshire and England): George was a delightful colleague, a great man on tours particularly. He had a vast knowledge of the game and he was always ready and willing to help any young player. As a wicketkeeper he was brilliant.', 'C. Washbrook (Lancashire and England): He was a magnificent wicketkeeper and a fighting little batsman. In his later years he became one of the shrewdest observers of the game and his advice was always available and eagerly sought by cricketers of every class and creed.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1929'],24.0,28.0,12.0,234.0,39*,14.62,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,45.0,15.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,504.0,545,206,4947,75,14.59,,,0,6,,,753.0,343.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,504.0,,68,73,0,-,-,-,6.44,-,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He was unfortunate that he followed two outstanding keepers - Alan Knott and Bob Taylor - and was, unfairly, viewed as an establishment figure. But behind the stumps he was a calming influence in a Middlesex side packed with big names, a side with whom he played the majority of his career. On retiring in 1991 he forged a successful career in the City and was appointed managing director of England cricket in October 2013. \n', ""He began his career at Kent, winning his cap in 1979, but the return of Alan Knott persuaded him to move to Middlesex, who themselves had been struggling to fill the void left by the retirement of John Murray in 1975. Indeed, it was Murray, in his role as an England selector, who was instrumental in getting Donwton picked to tour Pakistan and New Zealand as Bob Taylor's understudy in 1977-78.

The selection see-saw continued in 1984 when Downton was recalled following Taylor's retirement, and he was England's first choice until 1986,  largely as a result of his much-improved batting,  especially against quick bowling.  "", ""But his wicketkeeping, although generally sound, was blighted by the occasional high-profile howler and those cost him dear. He was in the England side which reached the 1987 World Cup final, and played in the first three Tests against West Indies in 1988 before being dropped as the selectors' desperation to stem the run of defeats increased.

The body was taut and muscular. He would not have been remotely out of place in a 21st-century dressing room where a player's physical condition is too easily a fetish rather than a healthy consideration. Douglas looked more like a boxer than a Test allrounder. And that was what he was, of course. Those who yawned at his unwaveringly wearisome batting approach argued with some validity that he was worth watching only when he stepped into the ring. \n"", ""That was a cutting comment on someone who captained his country at cricket and led it to success against the Australians before the First World War. Yet he was never a batsman to ignite a schoolboy's imagination or stir a wing-collared Edwardian scribe to flights of purple prose."", ""One of the endless fascinations of cricket is the extent of dichotomy among its practitioners. It is the sport in which the brawny blacksmith, romantic icon of rural rampage, does not bowl fast at all but instead pedantically blocks out the last half-hour to earn an honourable draw. It is the bespectacled accountant, pallid of features and delicate of forearm, who crashes four boundaries in an over. In Douglas's case he batted as if losing a competitive stroll with a tortoise - and flung his fists in ferocious combinations of punches to excite black-tied audiences, baying for blood after port, at the National Sporting Club."", ""He came from a family steeped in the noble art. His father, Johnny H Douglas, was a famous personality in the annals of boxing, a familiar figure at the old Covent Garden Club. Brother `Pickles' Douglas was a renowned referee, handling title fights. At Felsted School Johnny's own boxing prowess was a matter of approving debate among his fellow fifth-formers. There was never any likelihood of him fighting for money but he boxed proudly for the family name."", ""In the ringside seats his family shouted encouragement and liked the way, with a pair of boxing gloves, he could look after himself. The dour countenance that he was apt to convey at the crease was a good deal less evident when he was trading blows, usually with some style. He became the best amateur middleweight in England and was crowned Olympic champion in 1908 when he beat Reginald `Snowy' Baker on points. The fight was so close that a popular myth sprang up (and remains to this day) that the judges could reach no decision and the gold was finally awarded by the referee - Douglas's father. But Douglas senior was not refereeing at all. He was ringside only so that he could present the medals in his capacity as president of the Amateur Boxing Association."", ""JWHT Douglas, to allow him his full flourish of initials (the printers gave him the works on the boxing billboards), was also a referee. They used to say he was a martinet as he danced round the two fighters. He was always sparing with his smiles; in the ring, whether boxing or adjudicating, he remained grim-faced, his sleek middle-parting hair unruffled. So he needed to be when handling two adversaries not averse to villainy on the referee's blind side. In 1914 he had whispered a few cautions to George `Digger' Stanley, once a world bantamweight champion and well known for a range of dark-alley tricks. By the 13th round Douglas had seen enough and disqualified Digger. The defeated boxer's noisy mates, many from the gipsy community from where he came, turned on the referee. But that did not bother Douglas. He played and judged his sport by the letter."", ""That was why he once rounded on Wally Hammond when captaining an Essex game against Gloucestershire. He and his team-mates were convinced that the `prince', as Hammond was known in the West Country, was caught in the covers by Laurie Eastman off a ball from the slow left-armer Joe Hipkin. Douglas led the protests when Hammond did not walk. The umpire, caught in a mid-afternoon reverie and uncertain what had happened, spluttered that it had been a bump-ball."", 'Douglas was seething. At the close of play he went into the Gloucestershire dressing room. He had already offered a few choice words of anger at Wally on the pitch. Now he demanded to know where he was. Reg Sinfield, who was present, recounted with a chuckle that Hammond remained out of sight behind the door. Next morning, when Essex were batting and Douglas was at the crease, Hammond pointedly asked for a bowl, a request captain Bev Lyon heard less and less in those days. ""He went on and hurled them down faster than I\'d ever seen from him before,"" said Sinfield. ""He left poor old Johnny black and blue and I felt pretty sorry for him. Yet what courage.""', ""The boxer's pluck was rarely far away. It made up for a somewhat saturnine character and no natural or easy affinity with the players. They still knew he would battle for them, not wantonly prepared to give his wicket away or be needlessly generous to the other side. The competitive aspect to his play was equally apparent in his not insignificant soccer career, during which he won an amateur international cap."", ""But his cricket, whatever the groans about his painfully limited batting repertoire, should not be disregarded. He played in 23 Tests and, with SF Barnes gobbling up the wickets, he led England to an Ashes triumph in 1911-12, having taken over the captaincy when Plum Warner was ill. He played for Essex from 1901 to 1928, scoring 24,531 runs and 26 hundreds. His bowling, with its lateral movement, brought 1,893 wickets. The boxer's sturdy fists held on to 365 catches. The pundits of the day went off his Test captaincy after the 1914-18 war and the records appear to bear that out. But he achieved the season double - 100 wickets and 1,000 runs - five times."", 'John William Henry Tyler (""Johnny Won\'t Hit Today"" to the Australian public) Douglas may not have been everyone\'s idea of a figure of shining or inspirational endearment. But his innate courage never deserted him. That was poignantly evident in 1930 when he was drowned at sea trying to save his father\'s life, after two vessels collided in the fog. The seas were rough and the two did not quite beat the count.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1915'],23.0,35.0,2.0,962.0,119,29.15,,,1.0,6.0,,0.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,651.0,1035,156,24531,210*,27.90,,,26,107,,,365.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.0,37,2812,1486,45.0,5/46,5/46,33.02,3.17,62.4,2,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,651.0,,83528,44160,1893,9/47,,23.32,3.17,44.1,,113,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Though he had the patience and technique to develop a long innings or fight a rearguard action according to the position of a match - six of his nine Test hundreds were bigger than 140 - it was the naked power of his driving on the counter-attack that fired the imagination. An athletic six-footer with something of the feline grace and strength of the golfer Tiger Woods, Dexter\'s most famous innings was the 70 he smashed, from 73 balls, off Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith, after coming in when England were 0 for 1 in the 1963 Lord\'s against West Indies. In county cricket, Dexter was the only batsman who habitually dominated Derek Underwood, regularly scoring hundreds for Sussex against Kent. In 1968, on his first Championship appearance after two years of semi-retirement, he blasted them for a devastating 203 which immediately won him back his Test place. Dexter was a magnificent allround games player. His next-best game was golf - he won the Oxford & Cambridge President\'s Putter three times, the last time at the age of 52 - and he was arguably the leading cricketer-golfer Britain has ever produced. Early retirement gave ""Lord Ted"" scope to turn his restless mind to many interests, among them forming a PR company and covering cricket as a broadcaster and writer. In 1989 a new cricket post in cricket was created for him, the chairmanship of the ""England Committee"", for which he did much important groundwork for the future. But in his twin role as chairman of selectors, his judgment let him down.

He was 75. Denton made his first appearance for Yorkshire in 1894 and concluded his career as an active cricketer in 1920. He did little as a batsman when he first played with the county, but in the following year, coming off early in the summer against both Cambridge University and Lancashire, he made his place secure. For twenty-one seasons his record exceeded 1,000 runs, his aggregate reaching 2,000 in five summers, and in 1905 amounting to 2,405, with an average of 42. For twenty years this stood as the highest Yorkshire aggregate until surpassed by Herbert Sutcliffe. \n', 'Possessed of very flexible wrists, Denton made strokes all round the wicket with considerable hitting power, while he played forward so hard that he always made the ball travel. On fast wickets he seized every opening to score on the off side, cutting in particularly brilliant fashion, and when the ground was slow he employed the pull and the hook with fine effect. The force of his strokes was surprising as he was below medium height and lightly built. He batted in exceptionally good style and never lost any time in getting to work. Going out for runs immediately he arrived at the wicket, he naturally gave many chances and was sometimes referred to as the luckiest of cricketers. Certainly he often enjoyed a liberal share of good fortune, but if let off he would settle down to hitting as clean and well-timed as it was continuous.', ""Brilliantly as he batted, Denton attained to even higher excellence as a fieldsman, especially in the deep and at third man. Indeed, he held a place almost alone as an outfield, no one chasing the ball at a greater speed, picking it up more clean or returning it more quickly. A rare judge of a high catch in the long field, he established among his colleagues such a firm belief in his abilities that on one memorable day at Lord's when he committed two blunders the whole Yorkshire team were upset."", 'In the course of his career he scored 36,520 runs in first-class matches with an average of 33. He put together 69 three-figure innings--61 of these for Yorkshire--his highest being 221 against Kent at Tunbridge Wells in 1912, 209 not out against Worcestershire at Worcester in 1920, and 200 not out against Warwickshire at Birmingham in 1912. Three times he registered two separate hundreds in the same match--107 and 109 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 1906, 131 and 121 against the M.C.C. at Scarborough in 1908, and 139 and 138 against the Transvaal at Johannesburg for the English team which went out to South Africa in 1909-10. These last two scores he immediately followed with 104 against South Africa, and so played three successive three-figure innings. This feat was accomplished on the occasion of his second visit to South Africa, where he went first in the winter of 1905-6. Denton never went to Australia. Presumably it was feared he might not enjoy at the hands of the Australians the luck which generally favoured him in this country and that the match-winning qualities he possessed in being able to score so rapidly would lose their value in games played without a time limit. On the other hand, his fielding must have been an asset to any side. On his one Test appearance against Australia at Leeds in 1905 he accomplished little, but he played in ten Tests in South Africa.', ' Denton figured in many Gentlemen and Players matches, and for the professionals at Scarborough in 1906 he scored 157 not out. Twice he took part in a stand of more than three hundred runs, putting on 312 in company with George Hirst against Hampshire at Southampton in 1914 and 305 with J. W. Rothery against Derbyshire at Chesterfield in 1910. As his benefit he was given the Yorkshire v. Lancashire match at Leeds in 1907, and the contest yielded a profit of nearly £2,000. Following upon his retirement from active participation in the game, Denton fell into bad health and for a time acted as scorer for Yorkshire, but, undergoing an operation performed by Sir Berkeley Moynihan, he recovered so completely that from 1925 onwards he found himself able to perform the duties of an umpire in first-class cricket.', 'Born at Thornes, near Wakefield, on July 4, 1874, Denton played for several years for Hodgson and Simpson, for whom in olden days quite a number of famous Yorkshire cricketers qualified to play in local competitions. Among these was Edmund Peate, the greatest left-handed slow bowler of his day.

Tallish and slim, well-balanced, immaculately dressed on and off the field, possessed of a fine array of strokes and an excellent cover fieldsman to boot, Denness looked a model cricketer in every way. It was his misfortune that when those qualities won him the England captaincy, after Ray Illingworth's dismissal, he lacked the support of one of the players on whom he was most dependent. Geoff Boycott, who made no secret of how acutely he coveted the captaincy himself, played only the first six of Denness's 19 Tests as captain, which fatally holed England's prospects against Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in Australia in 1974-75. Deposed when Australia won the first Test of 1975 at Edgbaston, Denness took his medicine with typical graciousness. He later became an ICC match referee but, at Port Elizabeth in 2001-02, his decision to sanction six Indian players, including Sachin Tendulkar, caused such a furore that the Indian and South African boards barred Denness from officiating in the next match, at Centurion. The ICC responded by withdrawing Test status from the game. He died in April 2013 after a battle with cancer during his final days as president of Kent.

He was also England's first professional captain.
 ","['\n', ' ', '\nSir Len Hutton, who died in hospital at Kingston-upon-Thames on September 6, 1990, aged 74, was one of the greatest batsmen the game has produced in all its long history. In the Hall of Fame he sits at the high table with the élite, and if English cricket alone is taken into consideration he was one of the two most accomplished professional batsmen to have played for his country, the other being  Sir Jack Hobbs with  Walter Hammond and  Denis Compton coming next ', '. \n', ""He was born at Fulneck near Pudsey into a family in which there was a healthy respect for the old virtues of discipline and self-denial. It was also a keen cricketing family, and the boy seems to have nursed ambitions deep in his heart to become a great player. He devoured anything he could lay his hands on about the art of batting, and by the time he had come to the notice of  George Hirst he was already a complete player. Indeed, Hirst proclaimed that there was nothing to teach him;  Sutcliffe, more extravagant in his praise, predicted that he would play for  England. By  1934, still only 17, he was ready for first-class cricket, and in fourteen matches in the Championship he at once made his mark with five fifties and a maiden first-class century -- an innings of 196 against  Worcestershire at Worcester. Batting with supreme confidence he was last out in a total of 416. He also showed a high degree of skill in batting for four hours on a difficult pitch at Scarborough before being bowled by  Goddard for 67. Ill health a year later held him up, but in  1936 he made his 1,000 runs for the first time, often having to bat on rain-affected pitches in that vile summer. Impatient critics complained that he was too defensive. His answer was swift and to the point, and in  1937 he let loose a torrent of runs to show himself magnificently equipped with strokes. Against  Derbyshire at  Sheffield he made 271 not out, and when  Yorkshire entertained  Leicestershire at Hull he celebrated his 21st birthday with a fine 153, sharing in an opening partnership of 315 with Sutcliffe. His season's total of 2,888 (average 56.62) was second only to Hammond's. A broken finger in July 1938 put him out of cricket for around six weeks, but in  1939 he was in superlative form with 2,167 runs in the Championship and 2,883 in all matches, including twelve hundreds."", 'In 1941  Hutton injured his left arm so badly in a gymnasium during commando training that three bone grafts were needed to repair the damage done by the compound fracture. He was in hospital for eight months before he was finally discharged, his left arm weakened and some two inches shorter than the other. However, he set about restoring the strength to the withered arm, and by  1943 he was making plenty of runs in the Bradford League. His top hand was once more in control, as he always insisted it must be, and when in the summer of  1945 he played in the Victory matches against the Australian Services, and one or two other first-class games, all were agreed that his technique was in good working order and promised well for the future. In the post-war seasons he made runs in full measure, exceeding the 2,000 mark comfortably from  1947 to  1953 and never allowing the strain of Test cricket to interfere with his commitment to  Yorkshire. In the summer of  1949 he excelled himself. Two years earlier  Compton and  Edrich had held the stage, and  Hutton had merely had a good season. Now it was to be the turn of the Yorkshireman. His total of 3,429 runs, including twelve hundreds, was the fourth-highest aggregate in the all-time list. Furthermore he passed 1,000 runs in two separate months, breaking the record for a single month with 1,294 in June.', ""A batsman's worth must always by judged by his performances in Test matches.  Hutton was chosen to represent his country for the first time in 1937 against  New Zealand. He had a rough start to  Lord's, making 0 and 1, but he was quickly into his stride with 100 at  Old Trafford. A year later he was destined to make history and capture the public's imagination with his 364 at  the Oval.  Hammond wanted 1,000 on the board to be certain of victory and  Hutton, suiting his game perfectly to the needs of the occasion, obliged by staying at the crease for thirteen hours seventeen minutes until 770 had been scored. The following winter in  South Africa, without scoring heavily in the Tests, he delighted spectators wherever he played by the sheer quality of his batting. Back at home he was in irresistible form against the West Indians with 196 at  Lord's, the last 96 coming in 95 minutes, and he rang down the curtain on Test cricket for six years with 165 not out at  The Oval."", ""MCC's tour of  Australia in 1946-47 was reluctantly undertaken, for the prospect of a humiliation as complete as that of  1920-21 was abhorrent to them. But  Hutton, although often not in the best of health, had a splendid tour, scoring 1,267 runs and averaging 70. In the Second Test, at  Sydney, he savaged the Australian fast bowlers in an innings too scintillating to last, making 37 out of 49 before he unluckily hit his wicket, and he finished on a high note with an unbeaten 122 in the final Test at  Sydney before being laid low with tonsillitis between the close of first day's play and the resumption three days later. Early in 1948 he flew out to the  West Indies to reinforce  Allen's beleaguered team, but to expect him to rescue the series was asking too much. That summer, however, he was the centre of controversy in the middle of the Australian visit, when the selectors lost their heads and dropped him after he had looked in some discomfort against  Lindwall and  Miller at  Lord's. Promptly restored for  Headingley, he had the last laugh by finishing the series with scores of 81, 57, 30 (out of 52) and 64. His partnership of 359 in 310 minutes with  Washbrook at Ellis Park, Johannesburg, was the highlight of  MCC's successful tour of  South Africa under  F. G. Mann in  1948-49 and at the time was the highest for the first wicket in Test cricket. When  West Indies comprehensively defeated  England in  1950,  Hutton alone seemed able to fathom the wiles of  Ramadhin and  Valentine, and his undefeated 202 at  The Oval, when he carried his bat, was a magnificent fighting innings. Now he was nearing the final phase of his career, and he seemed to be playing better than ever. With  Compton immobilised,  Washbrook past his best and  Edrich no longer the player he was,  Hutton had to carry  England's batting. He responded by averaging 88.83 in the  1950-51 Test series in  Australia, 50 more per innings than the next Englishman; he again carried his bat, for 156 at  Adelaide, and at  Melbourne he had the satisfaction of making the winning hit in  England's first post-war victory over  Australia. But at  The Oval in  1951, against  South Africa, he had the misfortune to become the first player given out  obstructing the field in Test cricket."", ""In 1952, against  India,  Hutton became  England's first professional captain, although he had never captained his county. He at once showed his mastery of the job and kept his side splendidly on their toes. His handling of the young  Trueman was exemplary, keeping him sharp and full of energy by restricting him to short bursts. Three of the four Tests were won, rain depriving  England of victory at  The Oval. In  1953, when the Ashes were regained in a low-scoring but nevertheless absorbing series, his leadership throughout was firm and confident, and with no-one else averaging 40 he with 55 was much the best batsman on either side. His innings of 145 at  Lord's was as near perfect an exhibition of the art of batting as one could ever expect to see. The following winter found him leading  MCC abroad for the first time, and the West Indians on their own soil presented a formidable challenge. Nothing went right to start with, the first two Tests being lost through feeble batting, but in the end the series was squared 2-2, largely through the efforts of the captain, who followed his 169 at  Georgetown in the Third Test with 205 in the Fifth at  Kingston. He was at the crease for about sixteen hours for the two innings, and all the time in sweltering heat. It had been a phenomenal feat of concentration. Now one more task remained for him: the retention of the Ashes in  Australia. This was done in style in  1954-55, and after a grievous setback at  Brisbane in the First Test.  Hutton had two young batsmen at his command in May and  Cowdrey and a most potent weapon in  Tyson, for whose success he deserved much of the credit by encouraging him to shorten his run up to the wicket.  England won three Tests in a row and most likely were deprived of a run of four by rain at  Sydney.  Hutton had little energy left for long innings, but his 80 at  Adelaide was the cornerstone of the vital victory. He had to decline the offer of the captaincy for all five Tests against  South Africa in  1955, owing to continued ill health, and early in 1956 he announced his retirement. He had captained  England 23 times, winning eleven Tests, drawing eight and losing only four. Recognition of his achievements was swift. The previous year  MCC had made him an honorary member while he was still playing, and in June he received a knighthood for his great services to the game."", 'In 513 first-class matches,  Sir Leonard Hutton compiled 40,140 runs for an average of 55.51. He reached 100 centuries in 619 innings, the lowest ratio by an Englishman, and of his eventual total of 129 hundreds, eleven exceeded 200. Twelve times in  England and five times on tour overseas he passed 1,000 runs in a season. A useful leg-spinner in his early days, he claimed 173 wickets, average 29.51, and made 400 catches, generally in positions near the wicket. In 79 Test matches he scored 6,971 runs for the impressive average of 56.67, hitting nineteen hundreds and twice carrying his bat; he alone had passed 400 runs in a series eight times. He was a selector in 1975 and 1976 and had accepted the presidency of  Yorkshire not many months before he died. In his day he had no peer, and in the words of Geoffrey Chaucer,  He was a verray parfit gentil knight.', 'Many were the tributes paid to  Sir Leonard Hutton at the time of his death.', ':  ""I always admired him tremendously and learned a great deal through watching his technique.

He was the complete expert, and batting with him you just couldn\'t help but learn.""', ':  ""We were different characters but very good friends, and he was the greatest opening batsman I have ever seen.

His powers of concentration were remarkable, but when he wanted to be he was one of the best strokemakers in the game.""', ':  ""I was just so lucky to play my earlier matches in the  England side under his captaincy. He took all the trouble in the world to help me on my way.""', 'In 1950, ', ', in comparing the post-war  Hutton with the  Hutton of 1938, said:  ""His footwork is as light and sure and confident as  Bradman\'s ever was.

His success was a triumph of willpower over several technical deficiencies including a dominant bottom hand and unorthodox leg and head positions which led him to lean back in the drive. \n"", ""Taking over from Alec Stewart in July 1999, Hussain established himself as the best and - not coincidentally - the most articulate England captain since Mike Brearley. Under Hussain, England won four Test series in a row for the first time since Brearley, and rose to third place in the ICC Test Championship table when it was launched, after being ninth and last in the prototype Wisden World Championship in September 1999. Hussain's style of captaincy was a reflection of his personality, never static, always full of energy and ideas."", ""He was known to make four field-changes in one over in a Test match, searching for the solution, trying to make up for the lack of variety among his attack of mostly right-arm seamers with his own imaginative placements. His batting while captain veered from one extreme to another, from the heights of England's tour to South Africa to a worse run than even Brearley knew."", ""Yet so widespread was the recognition of Hussain's merit as captain that his place was never questioned, unlike Brearley's. Nor were there many calls for his head despite consecutive Ashes drubbings in 2001 and 2002-03."", 'However, after a disappointing performance by England in the 2003 World Cup, Hussain relinquished the one-day international captaincy, and he resigned the Test captaincy during the series against South Afrcia later in the summer explaining that he had ""grown tired"" of the role.', ""He played on in the team in that series, and toured Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the West Indies that winter, playing a big part in helping England to their first win in the Caribbean for 36 years. However, the calls for his resignation increased, and he finally resigned from all forms of cricket in May 2004, three days after an unbeaten hundred against New Zealand at Lord's. He immediately joined Sky Sports' commentary team, and quickly became one of its more incisive members."", ""A firebrand in his youth, renowned for looking after number one in run-out situations, Hussain tempered his fire into a fierce commitment to England's cause - when his brittle fingers weren't broken, that is.

No matter that his action wouldn't win any beauty contests: at his peak, around 1991, he was one of England's most consistent seamers, combining away movement, inswing and legcutters. He would later add offbreaks to his repertoire. His early promise earned him a Test debut in Australia at the age of 20, but his lack of firepower on overseas pitches meant he rarely extended his run of appearances beyond an English summer, and when Dominic Cork arrived on the scene in 1995, DeFreitas's Test career was over.

William Eric Hollies, who was born at Old Hill, Staffs on June 5, 1912 and died on April 17, 1981, aged 68, served Warwickshire from 1932 until 1957, by which time his steady legspinners and topspinners, with the occasional googly, had claimed 2201 wickets for the county, and 2323 in all first-class cricket. These aggregates were considerably higher than the runs he made. His batting, a perennial joke, brought him a career-highest of 47 in over 600 innings. He did once, though, help save a Test against South Africa, with an obstinate last-wicket stand with Jack Martin. \n', 'Fair-haired and on the short side, he bobbed in and delivered to a persistently unerring length such as possibly only Grimmett has ever matched. It is strange to contemplate the fact that he never performed a hat-trick. But he did take all ten - and without the help of the field: at Edgbaston in 1946 he bowled seven Notts batsmen and had the other three lbw, his 10 for 49 being the best to this day for Warwickshire in a county match. Twice also he took nine in an innings and seven times he took eight. In 14 seasons his toil was rewarded with 100 or more wickets. Truly was he the genial soul of the attack from one generation to the next.', ""He played 13 times for England, beginning in the crazy match in Barbados in 1935, when 29 wickets fell for 309 runs on a sticky wicket, and ending at Nottingham in 1950. Apart from that first tour of West Indies, he went to Australia in 1950-51, but Doug Wright was preferred for the Test matches. It was 12 years after his debut that Hollies played in his second Test series, taking 5 for 123 off 55.2 overs against South Africa at Nottingham. In the famous Oval match a year later when his clever googly deprived Bradman of a lifetime Test average of 100, he sent down 56 overs to take 5 for 131. He took five again in 1949 - for 133 in 58 overs - against New Zealand at Lord's, and five yet again the following year, this time for 63 as England beat West Indies by 202 runs at Manchester. Worrell and Weekes were among his victims."", 'And yet his greatest performance was probably for Warwickshire against the 1948 Australians. On a damp surface he flighted and spun eight of the tourists out in the first innings for 107 in 43.5 overs, including Bradman, Hassett and Harvey, and, curiously, both openers, Brown and Morris, ', '.', 'This was the year of his benefit - successful to the tune of £4896. In 1954 his testimonial returned a further £1796. A number of honours came late. In 1951 his 145 wickets (17.69) helped Warwickshire to their first Championship for 40 years; and in 1953 he once more scared the Australians with 7 for 59 in the county game.

By the end of the following summer he had been voted the bowler of the season by readers of Wisden Cricket Monthly, but he endured a horrific winter Down Under, where his arcing inswing was meat and drink to Australia's legion of left-handers - in particular, Matthew Hayden.  \n"", ""To his credit, Hoggard retreated to the ECB Academy in Adelaide, and returned with a snappier run-up to play his part in England's fifth-Test win at Sydney. By his own admission, he took a while to learn his role in the side, and his flashier colleagues consistently stole his limelight. But his moments when they came were worth waiting for - a brilliant hat-trick at Barbados in April 2004, and then a phenomenal 12-wicket haul at Johannesburg the following winter, where he single-handedly bowled England into a series-clinching 2-1 lead. And the following summer, he shrugged off a quiet start to the summer to contribute nine wickets at Trent Bridge and The Oval, as England sealed their first Ashes victory for 18 years. "", 'His batting is limited, but he has developed into a reliable tailend blocker and one of the most effective nightwatchmen in the game. After a solid series against Sri Lanka in 2006 - 15 wickets at 24.60 - he struggled against Pakistan with 10 expensive wickets, but showed unstinting efforts on the Ashes tour including a seven-wicket haul at Adelaide. He carried a huge workload and was ruled out of the final Test with a side strain, bringing an end to 40 consecutive appearances. A rusty display against New Zealand led to his axing after the first Test in Hamilton and though he earned a recall to the squad for the first Test of the 2008 season, he was subsequently overlooked on home soil at Headingley when the uncapped Darren Pattinson played as a replacement for Ryan Sidebottom.', ' July 2008']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1998', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2006']",67.0,92.0,27.0,473.0,38,7.27,2090.0,22.63,0.0,0.0,42.0,0.0,24.0,0.0,26.0,6,2,17.0,7,4.25,30,56.66,0,0,0,0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,239.0,305,94,1908,89*,9.04,,,0,4,,,63.0,0.0,150.0,49,25,144,23,6.00,,,0,0,,,18,0,57.0,11,5,59,18,9.83,41,143.90,0,0,6,3,8.0,0.0,67.0,122,13909,7564,248.0,7/61,12/205,30.5,3.26,56.0,13,7,1,26.0,26,1306,1152,32.0,5/49,5/49,36.0,5.29,40.8,0,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,239.0,,42349,21739,786,7/49,,27.65,3.07,53.8,,26,1,150.0,,6932,5273,205,5/28,5/28,25.72,4.56,33.8,2,4,0,57.0,56,1127,1553,51,3/19,3/19,30.45,8.26,22.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

December 16, 1882, Cambridge ","December 21, 1963, Hove, Sussex (aged 81 years 5 days) ",,"['England,', ""Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagram's XI,"", 'Surrey']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,"Jack Hobbs is one of the game's early masters. Nobody has scored more first-class runs than his 61,760, or more hundreds than his 199.  ","['\n', '\nJack Hobbs was cricket\'s most prolific batsman. He finished with 61,237 first-class runs and 197 centuries*, most of them stylishly made from the top of the Surrey or England batting orders. And he might have scored many more had the Great War not intervened, or if he hadn\'t been inclined to get out shortly after reaching 100 to let someone else have a go. Hobbs was known as ""The Master"", and scored consistently throughout a long career that didn\'t end till he was past 50. Half his hundreds came when he was over 40, and he remains, at 46 in 1928-29, the oldest man to score a Test century. His opening partnerships with Yorkshire\'s Herbert Sutcliffe are part of the game\'s rich folklore. Hobbs was also a charming man, and the world of cricket rejoiced in 1953 when he became the first professional cricketer to be knighted.  ', ' \n', ' ', ""\nJohn Berry Hobbs, the great batsman whose first-class cricket career spanned 30 years and brought him fame everywhere as a player second to none, was born in humble surroundings at No. 4 Rivar Place, Cambridge, quite close to Fenner's, Parker's Piece and Jesus College."", ""Christened John Berry Hobbs because his father's name was John and his mother's maiden name Berry, John -- or Jack as he was always known -- was the eldest of 12 children: six boys and six girls. His father was on the staff at Fenner's and also acted as a professional umpire. "", 'When Hobbs senior became groundsman and umpire to Jesus College, young Hobbs took immense delight in watching cricket there. During the school holidays he used to field at the nets and play his own version of cricket with the College servants, using a tennis ball, a cricket stump for a bat and a tennis post for a wicket on a gravel pitch. ', 'This primitive form of practice laid the foundations of his skill. Little more than 10 years old at the time, young Jack tried to produce the strokes which he had seen players employ in college matches. The narrow straight stump helped him to appreciate the importance of a straight bat, and with the natural assets of a keen eye and flexible wrists he learned to hit the ball surely and with widely varied strokes. ', 'Hobbs was self-taught and never coached, but he remembered all his life a piece of advice which his father gave him the only time the pair practised together, on Jesus College Close. Jack, facing spin bowling from his father, was inclined to stand clear of his stumps. ""Don\'t draw away,"" his father told him. ""Standing up to the wicket is all important. If you draw away, you cannot play with a straight bat and the movement may cause you to be bowled off your pads.""', ""When 12, Jack joined his first cricket team, the Church Choir XI at St. Matthew's, Cambridge, where he was in the choir, and the first match in which he ever batted was for the choir of Jesus College, who borrowed him, on their ground. He helped to form the Ivy Boys Club and they played both cricket and football on Parker's Piece."", ""Ranjitsinhji practiced there, and Hobbs watched his beautiful wrist-play wonderingly, but the hero of Jack's boyhood was Tom Hayward, son of Dan Hayward who looked after the nets and marquees on Parker's Piece. "", ""Cricket became Jack's passion and his supreme ambition was to be good enough to play for one of the leading counties, preferably Surrey, the county of his idol, Tom Hayward. Hobbs practised morning, noon and night, and when he knew that he would be busy during the day he rose at six and practised before he went to work."", ""Tom Hayward first saw him bat when the noted Surrey player took a team to Parker's Piece for the last match of the summer in 1901, the season in which Jack played a few times for Cambridgeshire as an amateur."", 'In 1902, Hobbs obtained his first post as a professional -- second coach and second umpire to Bedford Grammar School -- and in the August of that year he helped Royston, receiving a fee of half a guinea for each appearance. He hit a fine century against Herts Club & Ground, so bringing immense joy to his father, but Mr Hobbs was not destined to see further progress by his son, for he died soon afterwards.', ""Tom Hayward was instrumental in Jack going to Surrey. A generous man, Hayward arranged a benefit for the widow Hobbs, and another friend of the family, a Mr FC Hutt, asked Hayward to take a good look at Jack. Hobbs was set to bat for 20 minutes on Parker's Piece against William Reeves, the Essex bowler, and Hayward was so impressed that he promised to get Jack a trial at The Oval the following spring. "", ""Mr Hutt thought that Hobbs should also try his luck with Essex, but they declined to grant him a trial, and so, in April 1903, Hobbs went to Surrey. Immediately they recognised his budding talent and engaged him. A two years' qualifying period had its ups-and-downs for Hobbs -- he began with a duck when going in first for Surrey Colts at The Oval against Battersea -- but soon his promise was clear for all to see. "", ""In his first Surrey Club & Ground match he made 86 against Guy's Hospital, and in his second qualifying year -- 1904 -- when he played several matches as a professional for Cambridgeshire, he scored 195 in brilliant style against Hertfordshire. His apprenticeship over, Hobbs commenced in 1905 the long and illustrious career with Surrey in first-class company which was to make his name known the world over and earn him a knighthood from the Queen -- the first professional cricketer to receive the honour."", ""From the time he was awarded his county cap by Lord Dalmeny, afterwards Lord Rosebery, following a score of 155 in his first Championship match against Essex, Hobbs built up the reputation of the Master cricketer -- a reputation perpetuated by the Hobbs Gates at The Oval and by his other permanent memorial, the Jack Hobbs Pavilion, at Parker's Piece. "", 'The tables of his achievements, given here, tell eloquently how thoroughly he deserves remembrance by cricket enthusiasts, but comparisons with WG will still be made.', ""From this point of view, Hobbs was, without argument, the most accomplished batsman known to cricket since WG Grace. In his career, Hobbs scored 61,237 runs with an average of 50.65, and scored 197 centuries. He played in 61 Test Matches. Other players have challenged the statistical values of Hobbs' cricket. None has, since Grace, had his creative influence."", ""Like WG, he gave a new twist or direction to the game. Grace was the first to cope with overarm fast bowling, the first to mingle forward and back play. Hobbs was brought up on principles more or less laid down by WG and his contemporaries -- left leg forward to the length ball. Right foot back to the ball a shade short, but the leg hadn't to be moved over the wicket to the off. "", 'Pad-play among the Victorians was not done. It was caddish -- until a low fellow, a professional from Nottingham, named Arthur Shrewsbury, began to exploit the pad as a second line of defence -- sometimes, in extremity, a first.', 'When Hobbs played his first first-class match for Surrey, on a bitterly cold Easter Monday (April 24) in 1905, the other side, captained by WG was called The Gentlemen of England. Hobbs, then 22 years and four months old, scored 18 and 88 -- taking only two hours making the 88. Grace contemplated the unshaven youth from his position of point. He stroked the beard and said: ""He\'s goin\' to be a good\'un."" He could not have dreamed that 20 years later Hobbs would beat his own record of 126 centuries in a lifetime -- and go on to amass 197 before retiring, and receive a knighthood for services rendered.', 'Hobbs learned to bat in circumstances of technique and environment much the same as those in which Grace came to his high noon. The attack of bowlers concentrated, by and large, on the off stump. Pace and length on good pitches, with varied flight. On sticky pitches the fast bowlers were often rested, the damage done by slow left-hand spin or right-hand offbreaks. ', 'Legbreaks were called on but rarely, then as a last resort, though already Braund, Vine and Bosanquet were developing back-of-the-hand trickery. Swerve was not unknown in 1905; there were Hirst, Arnold, Relf, Trott, and JB King swinging terrifically. ', ""But in those days only one and the same ball was used throughout the longest of a team's innings. And the seam was not raised as prominently as on balls made at the present time."", ""In 1907, two summers after Hobbs' baptism of first-class cricket, the South Africans came to this country, bringing a company of googly bowlers as clever as any seen since -- Vogler (quick), Gordon White, Faulkner and Schwarz. Hobbs faced them only twice, scoring 18 and 41 for Surrey and 78 and 5 for CI Thornton's XI at Scarborough. "", 'JT Tyldesley, Braund, Jessop and Spooner also coped with the new witchcraft, so did George Gunn, who could cope with anything. Partly on the strength of his showing against the South Africans, Hobbs was chosen for his first overseas tour: 1907-1908 in Australia.', ""But it was two years later, when the MCC visited South Africa, that Hobbs demonstrated quite positively that he had found the answer to the problems of the back-of-the-hand spinners. The amazing fact is that he made his demonstration on the matting wickets then used in South Africa. What is more, it was Hobbs' first taste of the mat, on which the South African spinners were at their most viciously angular. "", ""South Africa won this rubber of 1909-1910 by three wins to two. In the Tests Hobbs scored 539 runs, average 67.37; double the averages of England's next best three run-makers:-- Thompson (33.77), Woolley (32.00), Denton (26.66) and Rhodes (25.11). "", 'It was Hobbs who first assembled into his methods all the rational counters against the ball which turned the other way. Moreover, on all kinds of pitches, hard and dry, in this country or in Australia, on sticky pitches here and anywhere else, even on the gluepot of Melbourne, on the matting of South Africa, against pace, spin, swing, and every conceivable device of bowlers, Hobbs reigned supreme.', 'His career was divided into two periods, each different from the other in style and tempo. Before the war of 1914-1918 he was Trumperesque, quick to the attack on springing feet, strokes all over the field, killing but never brutal, all executed at the wrists, after the preliminary getting together of the general muscular motive power. ', 'When cricket was resumed in 1919, Hobbs, who served in the Royal Flying Corps as an Air Mechanic after a short spell in a munition factory, was heading towards his 37th birthday, and a man was regarded as a cricket veteran in 1919 if he was nearing the forties. Hobbs entering his second period, dispensed with some of the daring punitive strokes of his youthful raptures. He ripened into a classic. His style became as serenely poised as any ever witnessed on a cricket field, approached only by Hammond. ', ""He scored centuries effortlessly now; we hardly noted the making of them. They came as the hours passed on a summer day, as natural as a summer growth. An astonishing statistical fact about The Master is that of the 130 centuries to his name in County cricket, 85 were scored after the war of 1914-1918; that is, after he had entered middle age. The more his years increased the riper his harvests. From 1919 to 1928 his seasons' yields were as follows:"", ' 2594 runs, average 60.32', '\n', ' 2827 runs, average 58.89', '\n', ' 312 runs, average 78.00 (a season of illness)', '\n', ' 2552 runs, average 62.24', '\n', ' 2087 runs, average 37.94', '\n', ' 2094 runs, average 58.16', '\n', ' 3024 runs, average 70.32', '\n', ' 2949 runs, average 77.60', '\n', ' 1641 runs, average 52.93', '\n', ' 2542 runs, average 82.00', 'From the time of his 43rd to his 46th birthday, Hobbs scored some 11,000 runs, averaging round about the sixties. Yet he once said that he would wish to be remembered for the way he batted before 1914. ""But, Jack,"" his friends protested, ""you got bags of runs after 1919!"" ', '""Maybe,"" replied Hobbs, ""but they were nearly all made off the back foot."" Modest and true to a point. The Master knows how to perform within limitations. Hobbs burgeoned to an effortless control not seen on a cricket field since his departure. The old easy footwork remained to the end. ', 'At Old Trafford a Lancashire colt made his first appearance against Surrey. He fielded at mid-off as McDonald, with a new ball, opened the attack on Hobbs. After a few overs, the colt allowed a forward stroke from Hobbs to pass through his legs to the boundary. His colleagues, notably burly, redfaced Dick Tyldesley, expostulated to him, ""What\'s matter? Wer\'t sleepin\'?"" -- with stronger accessories. The colt explained, or excused his lapse. He had been so much mesmerised watching Hobbs\' footwork as he played the ferocious speed of McDonald that he could not move.', ""It is sometimes said that Hobbs in his harvest years took advantage of the existing leg-before-wicket rule which permitted batsmen to cover their wickets with their pads against offspin pitched outside the off stump. True it is that Hobbs and Sutcliffe brought the second line of defence to a fine art. By means of it they achieved the two wonderful first-wicket stands at Kennington Oval in 1926 and at Melbourne two years later, v Australia, each time on vicious turf. But, as I have pointed out, Hobbs' technique was grounded in the classic age, when the bat was the main instrument in defence. "", ""Always was the bat of Hobbs the sceptre by which he ruled his bowlers. In his last summers his rate of scoring inevitably had to slacken -- from 40 runs an hour, the tempo of his youth, to approximately 30 or 25 an hour. In 1926, at Lord's for Surrey v Middlesex, he scored 316 not out in six hours 55 minutes, with 41 boundaries -- a rate of more than 40 an hour, not exceeded greatly these days by two batsmen together. And he was in his 44th year in 1926, remember. "", ""It was in his wonderful year of 1925 that he beat WG's record of 126 centuries, and before the summer's end gathered at his sweet will 3024 runs, with 16 hundreds, average 70.32. He was now fulfilled. He often got himself out after reaching his century. He abdicated."", 'Those of us who saw him at the beginning and end of his career will cherish memories of the leaping young gallant, bat on high, pouncing at the sight of a ball a shade loose, driving and hooking; then, as the bowler desperately shortened his length, cutting square, the blow of the axe -- a Tower Hill stroke. ', 'Then we will remember the coming of the regal control, the ripeness and readiness, the twiddle of the bat before he bent slightly to face the attack, the beautifully timed push to the off to open his score -- the push was not hurried, did not send the ball too quickly to the fieldsman, so that Hobbs could walk his first run. ', 'I never saw him make a bad or a hasty stroke. Sometimes, of course, he made the wrong good stroke, technically right but applied to the wrong ball. An error of judgement, not of technique. He extended the scope of batsmanship, added to the store of cricket that will be cherished, played the game with modesty, for all his mastery and produce, and so won fame and affection, here and at the other side of the world. A famous fast bowler once paid the best of all compliments to him -- ""It wer\'\'ard work bowlin\' at\'im, but it wer\' something you wouldn\'t\'ave missed for nothing."" Let Sir Jack go at that.', 'Guardian', 'Other tributes:', ' Jack was the finest batsman in my experience on all sorts of wickets, especially the bad ones, for in our day there were more bad wickets and more spin bowlers than there are to-day. He soon knocked the shine off the ball and he was so great that he really collared the bowling. He could knock up fifty in no time at all and the bowlers would often turn to me as if to say Did you see that? He was brilliant. Despite all the fuss and adulation made of him he was surprisingly modest and had a great sense of humour.', ' On any type of wicket, he was the best batsman in my experience, a first-class bowler if given the chance, and the finest cover point I ever saw. He never looked like getting out and he was just the same whether he made 100 or 0. I remember G.A. Faulkner after an England tour in South Africa, saying to Jack: ""I only bowled you one googly."" ""Why,"" said Jack, ""I did not know you bowled one."" Faulkner said, ""You hit the first one I bowled for 4. If you did not know it how did you know it would turn from the off?"" ""I didn\'t,"" answered Jack. ""I watched it off the pitch.""', ' I was his partner on many occasions on extremely bad wickets, and I can say this without any doubt whatever that he was the most brilliant exponent of all time, and quite the best batsman of my generation on all types of wickets. On good wickets I do believe that pride of place should be given to Sir Don Bradman. I had a long and happy association with Sir Jack and can testify to his fine character. A regular church-goer, he seldom missed the opportunity to attend church service on Sunday mornings both in England and abroad. He was a man of the highest integrity who believed in sportmanship in the highest sense, teamwork, fair-play and clean-living. His life was full of everything noble and true.', ' Jack was the greatest batsman the world has ever known, not merely in his generation but any generation and he was the most charming and modest man that anyone could meet. No one who saw him or met him will ever forget him and his legend will last as long as the game is played -- perhaps longer.', "" My first trip to Australia in 1928 was Jack's last and I remember with gratitude how he acted as a sort of father and mother to the young players like myself. Always a boyish chap at heart, he remained a great leg-puller. When 51 he promised to come up and play in my benefit match in 1934 and despite bitterly cold weather he hit the last first-class century of his career. He told me he got it to keep warm!"", ' Jack was one of the greatest sportsmen England ever had, a perfect gentleman and a good living fellow respected by everyone he met. I travelled abroad with him many times to Australia and South Africa, and I always looked upon him as the finest right-handed batsman I saw in the 30 years I played with and against him.', ' He was the greatest batsman of my time. I learned a lot from him when we went in first together for England. He had a cricket brain and the position of his feet as he met the ball was always perfect. He could have scored thousands more runs, but often he was content to throw his wicket away when he had reached his hundred and give someone else a chance. He knew the Oval inside out and I know that A.P.F. Chapman was thankful for his advice when we regained the Ashes from Australia in 1926.\n']","['Knighted for services to cricket 1953', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1909, 1926', 'Selected as one of five Wisden cricketers of the century, 2000']",61.0,102.0,7.0,5410.0,211,56.94,,,15.0,28.0,,8.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,834.0,1325,107,61760,316*,50.70,,,199,273,,,342.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61.0,11,376,165,1.0,1/19,1/30,165.0,2.63,376.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,834.0,,5217,2704,108,7/56,,25.03,3.10,48.3,,3,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

September 7, 1871, Kirkheaton, Yorkshire ","May 10, 1954, Lindley, Huddersfield, Yorkshire (aged 82 years 245 days) ",,"['England,', 'Europeans (India),', 'Yorkshire']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Left-arm medium-fast,,,,"['\nGeorge Hirst, who died at his Huddersfield home a few miles from his birthplace, Kirkheaton, on May 10, aged 82, was one of the most illustrious cricketers who graced the Golden Age. On the 24 occasions on which he played for  England, Hirst achieved only a few noteworthy performances, but such was his prowess with bat and ball for Yorkshire in a career spanning forty years that Lord Hawke described him as the greatest county cricketer of all time. Certainly this blunt, outspoken man of extreme buoyancy and cheerfulness brought such a tenacity to the game that no match in which he figured was won or lost till the last ball was bowled. Small wonder, therefore, that in Yorkshire he was an unchallenged hero, and throughout the length and breadth of England his popularity stood unrivalled. \n', ""Figures alone tell only part of the story of Hirst, but they show unmistakeably his supreme prowess as an all-round cricketer in the fullest meaning of the phrase. Between his first county game for Yorkshire in  1889 and his last in 1929, Hirst scored 36,203 runs, average 34.05, and took 2,727 wickets, average 18.77; at his peak friends and opponents alike recognised him as the best mid-off in the country, with a pair of hands so sure that a considerable proportion of his 550 catches were made from scorching drives in a period when strong driving was an essential component in every batsman's game. The measure of Hirst's ability is best reflected in that he accomplished the double feat of l,000 runs and 100 wickets fourteen times, a number surpassed only by his renowned contemporary, Wilfred Rhodes (16), and that he alone made 2,000 runs and took 200 wickets in a season, which he did in 1906. His figures were 2,385 runs and 208 wickets. Years afterwards, when asked if he thought his record might be broken, Hirst made an answer typifying his whole approach. With a twinkle in his eye, he replied: I don't know, but whoever does it will be very tired. Yet, through the years, he himself showed little evidence of fatigue. Only a very fit man, such as he was, could have reached 1,000 runs in 19 seasons and taken 100 wickets in fifteen different years."", 'The people of Kirkheaton and the surrounding areas almost lived for cricket and from an early age Hirst, born on September 7, 1871, showed that he would be a player of more than ordinary skill. He became associated with Huddersfield when 18 and before his 19th birthday his first ambition, that of playing for Yorkshire, was realised. Hirst was fond of recalling that in those days his equipment, which he carried to the ground in a canvas bag, was worth no more than ten shillings, that he wore a shilling cap, a sixpenny belt and brown boots. Success in county cricket came slowly, but after some seasons of quiet progress, he established himself in 1896 by scoring 1,122 runs and taking 104 wickets. Thenceforward he gathered strength as he went along. Of his 60 first-class centuries, all but four were played for Yorkshire, his highest being 341 -- still a county record -- against Leicestershire in  1905. Leicestershire suffered particularly from his bowling as well as from his batting. Twice he did the hat-trick against them, once in a match in 1907 in which he took 15 wickets, his greatest success in one game. Five times  Hirst bowled unchanged through a match, Rhodes being his partner on three occasions and Schofield Haigh on the other two, and twice he took three wickets in four balls.', ""The combination of Hirst and Rhodes was feared as much by batsmen as that of Peel and Briggs, Gregory and McDonald and, in later years, Grimmett and O'Reilly. In the 1902 Test match at Birmingham, Hirst and Rhodes bowled out  Australia for 36 runs, their lowest total in any Test.  Rhodes took seven wickets for 17, and Hirst three for 15. This was the most memorable joint feat of Hirst and  Rhodes, but in the next match the Australians met Yorkshire, who put them out for 23 (Hirst five for 9 runs and F. S. Jackson five for 12). Another Yorkshire bowling triumph in which Hirst played a notable part occurred in  1908 when he and Schofield Haigh dismissed Northamptonshire for 27 and l5, Hirst taking twelve wickets for 19 runs and  Haigh six for 19."", ""On his two tours to Australia, with A. E. Stoddart's team in 1897-98, and P. F. Warner's side in 1903-04, Hirst did not realise English hopes but he played a conspicuous role in a dramatic victory over Australia at The Oval in 1902. When Hirst, who scored 58 not out in the final innings, was joined by the last man, his lifelong friend and colleague, Rhodes, England required 15 to win. The story has been passed on that, as Rhodes met him on the way to the wicket, Hirst confidently murmured:  We'll get 'em in singles, Wilfred -- which they proceeded to do. Whether true or not, that is the type of remark Hirst would have made. One last instance of his versatility; in  1906 he scored two centuries and took eleven wickets in the match against Somerset at Bath."", 'Essentially a self-taught batsman, Hirst frequently gave of his best when the pitch afforded help to bowlers. His remarkable quickness of eye and feet enabled him to develop the hook and pull strokes so well that some bowlers complained that they found exceeding difficulty in bowling to him anything except a yorker which he did not treat as a long-hop. His liking for the hook was costly only in Australia. By contrast to his right-handed batting, Hirst was a natural left-arm bowler, a shade faster than medium. After a long bounding run, he delivered with a free, easy action and he often made the new ball swerve and dip into the batsman so late that many of his victims confessed themselves as suspecting that they had been thrown out from cover.  Hirst, in fact, has been described as the father of all modern seam and swing bowling. Before he showed its possibilities, bowlers rubbed the new ball in the dirt to take off the polish.', 'Hirst, short and thick-set, found perpetual pleasure in every game he played and captains such as Sir Pelham Warner have testified that they could not have wished for a better man to be in their teams. Both as a player and as a personality, none could speak too highly of him. Sir Pelham has said that when things were going wrong on tour Hirst was first to come to the aid of everybody with his ready wit.', 'When Hirst was given a benefit by Yorkshire in 1904 he received a sum of £3,703, a remarkable figure in those days. Seventeen years later a testimonial for him produced £700. Virtually that came at the finish of his active career, for he became coach at Eton College in 1921, but he played occasionally for Yorkshire for another eight years. During his 18 years at Eton, Hirst endeared himself to hundreds of young cricketers who benefited from his kindly guidance, and nothing was more fitting than that M.C.C. should include him in the 26 professionals whom they honoured in 1949 with Honorary Life Membership.', ""Cricket was George Hirst's life and less than a year before his death he sat with  Rhodes, now sightless, while England recovered from a seemingly hopeless position against Australia at the Leeds ground on which he himself so often stood in the breach.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1901'],24.0,38.0,3.0,790.0,85,22.57,,,0.0,5.0,,3.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,826.0,1217,152,36356,341,34.13,,,60,201,,,605.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24.0,44,4010,1770,59.0,5/48,9/86,30.0,2.64,67.9,1,3,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,826.0,,123328,51371,2742,9/23,,18.73,2.49,44.9,,184,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Molly Hide was a farmer's daughter from Surrey (though she was born in Shanghai) who became one of the great pioneers of women's cricket in England. She played in the first ever women's Test in Brisbane in December 1934 and was England captain for 17 years. Tall and lithe, she could drive the ball beautifully, but her batting had a strength as well as a style that astonished sceptical male spectators, many of whom in her era thought women's cricket was like a dog on its hind legs. Her first great triumph came after the 1934-35 tour moved on to New Zealand, when she scored a century in the Christchurch Test, putting on 235 with Betty Snowball. England declared at 503 for five -- New Zealand had been bowled out for 44, and lost by an innings and 337. She became captain for the home series against Australia two years later and held the post until her retirement in 1954. She would have missed the 1939-40 tour of Australia because her parents persuaded her to stay on the farm and not go gallivanting. But the tour was cancelled anyway, and when it finally took place nine years later she scored five centuries, including 124 not out at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and her portrait was hung in the pavilion. In 15 Tests she scored 872 runs at 36.33, and took 36 wickets at 15.25, with the slowish off-cutters that she bowled only reluctantly. Her captaincy was firm, even stern, and she remained in touch with the game, as a selector and, in 1973, president of the Women's Cricket Association. Molly Hide also played lacrosse for England.

With 57 first-class hundreds under his belt he arrived on the international scene in 1991 as England's Great White Hope, was dropped four tortuous Tests later, and was in and out for the next decade, until dropped for good at the end of England's triumphant tour to Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2000-01. All the while he remained a colossus at county level, where he continued to churn out the centuries for Worcestershire in his sleep. John Bracewell called Hick a flat-track bully, and though that may be harsh, he has rarely dominated the best attacks and can be psyched out, as Merv Hughes will testify. He was a gentle giant who murdered medium pace and occasionally savaged the spinners. From his breakthrough century in India in 1992-93 to England's tour of South Africa three years later, Hick averaged in excess of 45, and was beginning to look the part at Test level. But England's new chairman of selectors, Ray Illingworth, was less convinced. Hick was also an under-used offbreak bowler and a second-slip fielder of flawed brilliance. Many would have quietly retired once their international career ended, but Hick's appetite for runs remained undiminished and he scored heavily at county level, chipping away at the records as he went. After a - by his standards - poor 2005 and an uncertain start to 2006, in June some started preparing his cricketing obituary. He bounced back with a hundred, went on to score 1000 runs in an English summer for the 19th time, and signed a new contract with Worcestershire to underline that there was still life in the old dog. In 2008, Hick became the most prolific run-scorer in all cricket, with more than 64,000 runs to his name, and his tally of 136 first-class hundreds places him eighth on the all-time list.

Few batsmen of his own or any other day were so well worth looking at as William Gunn. He carried his great height--he must have been nearly if not quite 6ft. 3in.-without the least stoop, and there was a natural grace in his every movement. Wherever he played he was the most striking figure in the field. As a batsman he represented the orthodox--one might even say the classic-- school at its best. With his perfectly straight bat and beautifully finished style, he was a model to be copied. Not for him the hooks and pulls of present-day run-getters. He may at times have indulged in a pull, but as a general rule he hit the off ball on the off side, and hit it with tremendous power. Blessed with a splendid pair of wrists, he excelled in the hit past cover-point, the ball travelling along the ground at a pace that might have beaten Mr Vernon Heyde, whom Gunn himself described as the best cover-point he had everseen. \nIt was sometimes urged that, considering his advantages of height, reach and strength, Gunn played too restrained a game, but he had a good answer to his critics. He said once to the writer of these lines, ""I can make as big hits as anyone if I like, but if I begin to lift the ball I never score more than 40."" As an innings of 40 would in his prime have fallen far short of his desires, he did well to go his own way, and keep the ball down. While batting with complete self-control, he was often brilliant enough to satisfy the most eager lovers of fine hitting, and even when he had a quiet half hour or so he was still a delight to the eye. \nHis was no sudden jump to fame. Outside Nottingham the public knew nothing of him till he was over 21, and his first efforts in the Notts eleven in 1880 gave little suggestion of the career that was before him. In 20 innings he scored scarcely more than 160 runs. At that time his outfielding was a greater asset than his batting. He could run a hundred yards inside eleven seconds, and he judged the lofty catch unerringly. He learned the game in face of some difficulties. Employed in Richard Daft\'s shop in Nottingham, he had not much spare time, but, determined to make himself a cricketer, he used to get some practice at unearthly hours in the morning. During the strike of the leading professionals that demoralized Notts cricket in 1881, he stuck to his place in the eleven, and improved so much that he had an average of 24. He was greatly encouraged that season when the old Notts fast bowler, John Jackson, who stood umpire in one of the matches, told him he had never seen a colt, who batted so well. The next two years were years of marked progress--he was second to Shrewsbury in the averages in 1884, when Notts had a wonderful season--and in 1885, with an innings of 203 for the M.C.C. against Yorkshire at Lord\'s, he took the position among English batsmen that was his untill, in the ordinary course of nature, time began to tell upon him. At his very best from 1889 to 1898, he remained a fine player till 1903, when he scored 998 runs for Notts with an average of 38. Then, with a big and rapidly-growing business to look after, he thought he had done enough. He played in only four matches in 1904, and from that time he was an onlooker, content to see the name of Gunn in Notts cricket worthily kept before the public by his two nephews, George and John. \nDuring his long career William Gunn played many innings that have become historical. His 228 for the Players at Lord\'s in 1890 is the highest score ever made against the Australians in this country. The Australians as a team were not strong in 1890, but they had Charles Turner and Ferris to bowl for them. With regard to this particular match rather a good story has been told. Asked in an interview whether he had ever felt tired of cricket, Sydney Gregory said he thought not, except, perhaps, when he heard Billy Gunn say "" No "" at Lord\'s for seven hours and a half. Another great innings that Gunn played was his 139 for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord\'s in W. G. Grace\'s jubilee match in 1898. Just after he went in Gunn was beaten and all but howled by one of Kortright\'s fastest. Then he played magnificently, till at last, deceived in the pace, he lunged forward at a slow ball from Woods and was bowled all over his wicket. Between 1888 and 1899, Gunn played in nine matches for England against Australia. He did best in 1893-- when, incidentally, he just beat Stoddart in the season\'s averages-scoring 77 at Lord\'s and 102 not out at Manchester. Though he made bigger scores without number, Gunn never played finer cricket than in the memorable match between Notts and Surrey at the Oval in 1892. His 58 against the superb bowling of George Lohmann and Lockwood on a far from easy wicket was a veritable masterpiece of batting. For an hour and a quarter on the second afternoon he and William Barnes withstood a tremendous onslaught. It was cricket that no one who saw it could ever forget. In his young days Gunn was a famous forward at Association Football, combining skill with great speed. He was a mainstay of Notts County and played for England in 1884 against Scotland and Wales. \n', '\n \n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1890'],11.0,20.0,2.0,392.0,102*,21.77,,,1.0,1.0,,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,521.0,850,72,25691,273,33.02,,,48,117,,,333.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,521.0,,3540,1800,76,6/48,,23.68,3.05,46.5,,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Only one cricketer, Sir John Hobbs, in the whole history of the first-class game hit more centuries than Hendren's 170; only two, Hobbs and F. E. Woolley, exceeded his aggregate of runs, 57,610 at an average of 50.80 per innings. \n"", '""Patsy,"" as, because of his Irish ancestry, he was affectionately known the world over, joined the Lord\'s groundstaff in 1905 and from his first appearance for Middlesex in 1909 he played regularly till 1937. Not always orthodox in style, this short, stockily-built batsman was celebrated for the power with which he invested his driving, for his cutting and for his courage in hooking fast bowlers. On pitches helpful to bowlers he used his feet with consummate skill. His ability as a deep fieldsman is illustrated to some extent by the number of catches he brought off, 725, but the number of runs he saved cannot be gauged.', 'Apart from his achievements, ""Patsy"" was a ""character"" of a type sadly lacking in modern cricket. No game in which he was engaged could be altogether dull. If it looked like becoming so, Hendren could be relied upon at one time or another to produce some antic which would bring an appreciative chuckle from the onlookers. Furthermore, he was a first-rate mimic and wit, qualities which made him an admirable member of teams on tours, of which he took part in six -- three in Australia, one in South Africa and two in the West Indies. Altogether he played in 51 Test matches, 28 of them against Australia, scoring 3,525 runs.', 'Of his seven centuries in Tests the highest was 205 not out against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1930, when he and L. E. G. Ames (105) shared a fourth wicket stand of 237. ""Patsy\'s"" aggregate of 1,766, average 126.14, in that tour remains a record for a season in the West Indies. His highest innings in first-class cricket was 301 not out from the Worcestershire bowling at Dudley in 1933; on four occasions he put together a hundred in each innings of a match and he reached three-figures for Middlesex against every other first-class county. His best season was that of 1928 when he hit 3,311 runs, including 13 centuries, at an average of 70.44. In three summers he exceeded 3,000 runs; in 12 he made more than 2,000 and in 10 over 1,000. Among many big partnerships with his great friend and county colleague, J. W. Hearne, that of 375 against Hampshire at Southampton in 1923 was at the time a world record for the third wicket.', ""In 1933 Hendren caused something of a sensation at Lord's by batting against the West Indies' fast bowlers wearing a special cap. Fashioned by his wife, this cap had three peaks, two of which covered the ears and temples, and was lined with sponge rubber. Hendren explained that he needed protection after being struck on the head two years earlier by the new-fashioned persistent short-pitched bouncers."", 'Following his retirement from the field, he succeeded Wilfred Rhodes as coach at Harrow School and for four years held a similar post with Sussex. He was elected a life-member of M.C.C. in 1949 and also served on the Middlesex Committee. In 1952 he became scorer for Middlesex, continuing until ill-health compelled him to give up in 1960. In his younger days he was a fine Association football wing forward, playing in turn for Brentford, Queen\'s Park Rangers, Manchester City and Coventry City, and he appeared in a ""Victory"" International for England in 1919.', 'Tributes included:', 'Sir John Hobbs: ""Patsy was a great cricketer and great companion. He was the life and soul of the party on all our tours. In my opinion he was as good a player as anyone. He had beautiful strokes and he did get on with the game. I do not know of any bowlers who could keep him quiet on a good pitch and he was not so bad on the stickies. He was at his best after the 1914-18 War when he and Jack Hearne carried the Middlesex side.""', 'Mr. S. C. Griffith, Secretary of M.C.C.: ""Patsy was coaching Sussex while I was Secretary of the county and I also played with him.

Had he possessed a different temperament he would doubtless have improved upon his splendid records, for his skill and judgement were such that he made batting successfully against first-class bowlers appear the easiest thing imaginable. Not only did he show complete mastery in the art of back-play, but he frequently got right in front of his wicket and walked down the pitch to meet the ball no matter what type of bowler he was facing. Rarely when he left his ground in this way did his skill betray him and yet, though obviously so completely at home that he could have done almost anything with the ball, he would make a stroke which sent it tamely to the bowler, to mid-off or to mid-on. In match after match this practice of merely killing the ball was indulged in to such an extent as to become almost an obsession. It appeared to furnish Gunn with complete satisfaction, but it occasioned considerable annoyance to spectators who knew that, if he wished, he could score both without undue effort and as rapidly as anybody. \n', ""A younger brother of John Gunn and a nephew of William Gunn, George Gunn first appeared for Nottinghamshire in 1902. He met with no special success to begin with, but displayed such good style and powers of defence that there could be little doubt about his class. He steadily improved, but a haemorrhage of the lungs late in July ended his cricket for the summer. Happily a winter in New Zealand did him so much good that in 1907 he took the field again and, finishing at the top of the averages, bore a big part in winning the Championship for Nottinghamshire. Although his health was thus obviously re-established, his friends decided that he should spend the next winter in Australia. There went a team sent by M.C.C. and the illness of A. O. Jones, the captain, necessitated a call upon Gunn's services. The young professional made full use of his chance, making 119 and 74 in the first of the five Test matches, 122 not out in the fifth and for the whole tour heading the batting figures with an average of 5l."", ""Visiting Australia again in 1911-12 under J. W. H. T. Douglas, Gunn again showed to marked advantage, batting so consistently that he averaged 42 in the Test matches. While he enjoyed a well-earned reputation for Test cricket in Australia, he had a tragic experience in England, where only once, at Lord's in 1909, was he called upon to play for his country. Upon his form at the time, his selection was a mistake; he himself thought he should not have been chosen and, playing without his usual confidence, he was dismissed for 1 and 0."", 'Apart from that failure upon what might have been a big occasion in his life, Gunn enjoyed a wonderfully successful career. For Nottinghamshire before the First World War he made over 13,000 runs in the course of twelve full seasons, his best summer being that of 1913 when he hit 1,697, average nearly 50. On cricket being resumed, he made five separate centuries in 1919, gaining an average of 65. For twelve consecutive seasons he registered over 1,000 runs, his aggregate amounting to nearly 1,800 in 1927 and again in 1928. Among his triumphs was a first-wicket stand of 252 with W. W. Whysall against Kent at Trent Bridge in  1924. He and Whysall altogether associated in 40 three-figure opening partnerships. Three times Gunn put together two hundreds in a match at Nottingham: 132 and 109 not out v. Yorkshire in 1913; 169 and 185 not out v. Surrey in  1919; and 100 and 110 v. Warwickshire in 1927 when aged 48. Characteristic of the man was the game with Yorkshire. He batted six hours for the 132, but, with no occasion for anxiety, he followed with 109 out of 129 in less than ninety minutes. He celebrated his 50th birthday by hitting 164 not out against Worcestershire at Worcester and in the  West Indies next winter he and A. Sandham obtained 322 for the first wicket against Jamaica at Kingston.', 'In the course of his career, Gunn played 62 three-figure innings and registered 35,190 runs, average 35.90. Of these runs 1,577 came in Australia, where he averaged 52. He was an excellent field at slip, where he brought off most of his 438 catches. He shared in one rare, if not unique, performance in 1931 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston when he and his son, the late G. V.

Debates about wicketkeepers cannot be stilled by statistics but what is beyond question is that Evans was the game's most charismatic keeper: the man who made the game's least obtrusive specialism a spectator sport in itself. His energy and enthusiasm brought the best out of other fielders, whatever the state of the game. But he added to that a technical excellence that has probably never been surpassed. \n"", ""Evans was born in North London, but moved to Kent when he was a baby and was brought up by his grandfather after the death of his mother. At Kent College, he was an all-round sportsman, and played in the school team mainly as a batsman: the games master thought wicket-keeper was a good place to hide one of the team's less mobile fielders. He made his  Kent debut in July  1939 as a batsman, but kept wicket in three of his next four games before the war came. His reputation only flourished when the former  England captain,  A. E. R. Gilligan, saw him in a Services match in 1942 and ensured that he received invitations for the major wartime matches."", ""By the end of the first post-war summer,  Evans had displaced Paul Gibb as  England's  wicket-keeper, after an excellent performance for the Players at  Lord's when he did not concede a bye. He let through one on his Test debut at  The Oval, which irritated him years later:  a silly little blighter from Jim Langridge, outside off stump. That kind of perfectionism ensured that there was no serious challenge to his pre-eminence for the next 13 years. At  Sydney, in  1946-47, he began standing up to  Alec Bedser, at first only for the old ball, then all the time. His menacing presence there made the bowler better and more confident; above all, according to  Bedser, it ensured that he bowled a full length.  Bedser got the idea from Herbert Strudwick, who had stood up to Maurice Tate; he insists that  Evans's fingers were never even marked by the experience.  He was so quick, and had such wonderful hands, you see."", 'Evans was not ashamed to tumble, perhaps making the comparatively easy look difficult. But he also executed stumpings with lightning speed, making the difficult look absurdly easy. He was one of the most theatrical of cricketers but, as with all the great performers, the apparent ease masked a self-discipline that the audience never suspected. His greatest secret was the meticulously observed lunchtime siesta ritual, which enabled him to keep fresh and focused. This gave him the ability to conduct the team like an orchestra, and he could flog life from the tired limbs of his teammates at the end of the hottest day. He had a remarkable physique: strong, sturdy, squat and astonishingly resilient, plus a keen eye, remarkable concentration and sharp reflexes.  Evans might have taken up boxing for a career: he flattened several opponents before the Kent authorities intervened and told him to choose between the sports. He chose.', ""At home, he missed only five Tests in 12 seasons between 1947 and 1958, and in all played 91. After the  1946-47 tour, Bill O'Reilly wrote that wicket-keeping was the only department where  England matched  Australia. In  1950-51, according to Trevor Bailey,  Evans did not miss a chance, and took one at  Melbourne that still amazed Bailey years later, when he  caught Neil Harvey standing up to  Bedser one-handed, horizontal, and airborne down the  leg side off a genuine leg-glance. But  Evans's value to his side and his popular appeal also hinged on his batting. At Adelaide in 1946-47, he famously batted for 97 minutes without scoring, to help Denis Compton to his second century of the match, and avoid likely defeat. More often, his batting was as flashy as his wicket-keeping: highlights included a century in the Old Trafford Test of 1950 and another against India at Lord's two years later, when he scored 98 before lunch."", 'He remained on his pedastal until 1959 when he was felt to have lapsed against India, and lost his place to Ron Swetman. The need for ""team building"" was cited. He promptly retired. There is evidence that he did so too early. In 1967, just short of his 47th birthday, he made a comeback during Canterbury Week while Alan Knott was playing for England and there was no available deputy. Huge crowds saw him keep - according to Wisden - ""superbly"". The England bowler Mike Selvey, now the ', ' cricket correspondent, played with him nine years later in a fun seven-a-side at The Oval.""My experience was an education. Late out-swing just whispered into his gloves. I slipped in a full-length in-swinger on leg stump - the most difficult to take - and there he was, down the leg side as if by telepathy, flicking the bails away as the batsman changed feet."" Selvey said he had never seen a better display of wicketkeeping.', 'Keeping alone could not account for his popularity. He made his highest score, 144, at Taunton in 1952. Afterwards, it was announced that there would be a collection for Somerset\'s beneficiary, Harold Gimblett. Evans at once volunteered to go round with the box, which he did with his cheery smile and banter, making the takings far larger than they would have been. He was always generous himself for good causes. He was equally famous for his night-time roistering, some of which would - in a sterner age - have got him into terrible trouble with the tabloids. His standard shipboard party piece, as Carmen Miranda leading the team in a fancy dress conga, has never quite been forgotten. Many who knew him well believe that behind the extrovert lay a rather sadder figure: he never quite settled into steady post-cricket employment. ""For all that Godfrey was a cricketing Falstaff,"" said his biographer Christopher Sandford, ""there was a touch of Hamlet too. He thought and fretted about life more than he let on.""', '  \nBut any sadness was well hidden, in later years, behind exuberant mutton-chop whiskers. He became best known as resident expert for the bookmakers Ladbrokes, reassessing the odds at each twist and turn of a Test match, usually getting it right, but, at Headingley in 1981 when he offered England at 500 to 1, famously getting it wrong. He also worked in the jewellery trade, and for some seasons was involved in a sponsored wicket-keeping award. He remained - even for cricket-lovers too young to have seen him - a symbol of some of the happiest times for English Test cricket, on the field and off it.

Hearne on September 14 in his 75th year will have came as a great\nshock to all who had known him as a man, a cricketer and a personal friend,\nand above all to those who played both with and against him during his distinguished career for England and Middlesex. Born on the 11th February 1891, he made his first appearance in eight matches for Middlesex in 1909-in which year he showed promise for the future with an innings of 71 against Somerset. In the following season he\nscored 725 runs and took 49 wickets, foreshowing his great future as an allrounder.\nIncidentally in the match against Surrey at the Oval in that year, when I was first invited to play for the County, J. W. and I each missed ""Razor"" Smith while he made six runs, with the result that we lost the match by two wickets ! 1 may say that both catches were "" sitters "". In the seasons of 1913, 1914 and 1920 J. W. scored over 2,000 runs and took over 100 wickets and it is worthy of mention that in 1923 he was one of the first four batsmen against Hampshire at Southampton to score a century each, which is extremely rare in the annals of the game. Alas, he never enjoyed robust health, and his bones being very brittle, he was very prone to injury: otherwise his record would have been infinitely greater.There has rarely been a more charming and modest man and cricketer, always helpful and encouraging to others. As a batsman he was never sensational, but his artistry was supreme and will never be forgotten by those who were fortunate enough to see it. He was a lovable character, a true friend and all who knew J. W. will feel his death deeply and cherish his memory.\n', ' ', ' \n', '""Young Jack"" Hearne (so-called to distinguish him from his Middlesex\nteam-mate and distant cousin JW Hearne) was a fine all-rounder who, part\nfrom the interruption to his career caused by World War One, would certainly\nhave reached a hundred hundreds. He was also an excellent leg break and\ngoogly bowler who took over 1,800 first-class wickets at an average of under\n25. He batted very correctly, invariably straight, and was a master at\nplacing the ball into gaps. A strong driver and hard hitter in his youth\ndespite a comparatively frail physique, he moderated his approach as he grew\nolder, but scored runs consistently, often in partnership with his friend Patsy Hendren. Altham said of Hearne ""he very clearly displayed the hallmark of class - the ability to play every stroke with perfect balance and in slow time"". He cut well, could force the ball through the covers off the back-foot, and was\nsuperb on the on-side. At times he relied more on his defensive prowess, and\nwas quite happy to wait for his runs when the conditions demanded it. He\nbowled his well-controlled leg-breaks and googlies from no more than a\ncouple of paces with a quick action that allowed him to bowl at close to\nmedium pace. He was less effective after the War, when on occasion control\nwould desert him, but when in form he was a very fine bowler indeed. An\nexcellent fielder who never flinched from the hard-hit ball - in 1928 he\ncaught and bowled Constantine, injuring his hand so severely in the process\nhe missed the rest of the season.', 'He joined the Lord\'s ground staff at 15, and at the age of 18 made his\nfirst-class debut, scoring 71. In 1910 he made two centuries, and against\nEssex at Lord\'s took seven wickets for 2 runs in five overs. In 1911 he did\nthe ""double"", and was picked to tour Australia. He did little with the ball\non Australian wickets - although with Barnes and Foster, England had more\nthan enough bowling - but made an immediate impact with the bat. Hearne made\n76 and 43 in his first Test, and a match-winning 114 in his second.\nUnfortunately this was the peak of his Test career - he played 19 more times\nfor England but only passed fifty once more. He failed in the 1912 series,\nbut toured South Africa in 1913-14. After the war, he regained his place in\nthe England team and toured Australia in 1920-21 (where he was struck by\nillness during the Second Test). He toured again in 1923-24, but did not\ndistinguish himself with either bat or ball. His Test average was fourteen\nruns below his first-class average. As a Middlesex player though, he went\nfrom strength to strength, with 11 scores over 200, completing the double in\n1920 and 1923 (he had performed the feat three times before the War), and\nplayed until 1936 - a quarter-century of cricket, for a man who had always\nstruggled with his health. Always immaculately attired, Jack was popular\nwith fellow players and the crowd alike, and was known for his quiet manner\nand subtle sense of humour.

He was handy lower-order batsman, a useful slip, and a respected coach - he spent his retirement with Oxford University in the summers and, for six years, with the Maharaja of Patiala in India in the winters.\n', ' \n', '\nHEARNE, JOHN THOMAS, one of the finest bowlers the game has ever known, who played for Middlesex and England died on April 17 after a long illness at Chalfont St. Giles in Buckinghamshire, the place of his birth on May 3, 1867. From 1891 to 1914 he held a prominent place among the very best bowlers, and finished his career with a record of 3,060 wickets, an aggregate surpassed only by W. Rhodes, 4,188, A. P. Freeman, 3,775, and C. W. L. Parker, 3,274.', ""Right-hand medium-pace, he took a fairly long run up to the wicket, and it would be difficult to recall a bowler with a more beautiful delivery, made as his left hand pointed down the pitch. Standing nearly five feet eleven inches, he brought the ball over with a perfectly straight arm, and such was his command of length that a batsman might wait many overs for a ball from which he was certain to score. Even on the best of wickets he got on quite an appreciable off-break and, varying his pace cleverly, he used at times to send down a fast ball which swung with his arm. On a bowler's wicket he could dismiss the strongest sides, and on one of the crumbling pitches which occasionally bothered batsmen forty years ago he was simply unplayable. The leading bowler, not only for Middlesex but for the M.C.C. in the days when the club programme included quite a number of first-class matches, he was called upon for an amount of work which would have tired out most men in a very few years, but his splendid methods served him so well that a career in first-class cricket, which opened in 1888, did not close until the 1914 war, and in 1923 at Edinburgh he took six wickets for 64 for Middlesex against Scotland."", ' Jack Hearne came of famous cricket stock. A nephew of old Tom Hearne and of George Hearne, both of whom played for Bucks and Middlesex, before the latter went to Catford Bridge, he was a cousin of G. G. Hearne, Frank Hearne and Alec Hearne, all distinguished professionals for Kent. His brother, Walter Hearne, also a good Kent bowler, broke down through knee trouble when he looked to have many years of success before him and then became scorer, as did Alec Hearne when his cousin died.', 'J. T. used to relate how chance helped him into first-class cricket. I was born and bred in Buckinghamshire, which, in my young days, did not have a county club or I might have got no further than that, but A. J. Webbe, having watched him on the Evelyn School ground, where Hearne coached, asked him to play in a Middlesex Colts match, and then against the Australians in 1888. He took two cheap wickets, but a further invitation for the next match against Surrey could not be accepted, one of the masters advising him that he was not qualified. By living with his brother in London this difficulty was overcome, but he still worked at Evelyn School during the summer, and in June 1890 he received a telegram asking him to play for Middlesex that very day.', "" I turned over my pitch-mowing job to someone else, dashed to the station, and from a newspaper found that Middlesex were playing Notts. When I arrived at Lord's just before lunch-time I saw 99 for no wicket on the score-board. Not until reaching the dressing-room did I learn that my side were batting. If Notts had been at the wickets I should not have played in that match. I remember Mr. Webbe leaning out of the pavilion window as I passed down the little alley to the players' room and saying, `It is quite all right but I nearly left you out.'"", "" When Notts batted near the end of the day I bowled J. A. Dixon with a real beauty, and as we left the field the great Arthur Shrewsbury said to me, `Well bowled, young'un. If you bowl like that you will get someone else out to-morrow'--and I did--six for 62. That is how I began my connection with Middlesex and, barring a couple of matches missed through a strained arm, I went on playing for the county without a break until I retired from county cricket in 1914."", ""Next season at Lord's he took 14 Yorkshire wickets for less than five runs apiece, and in 14 matches the capture of 118 wickets for ten runs each put him top of the first-class averages. From that proof of ability he went steadily ahead, and in 1893 the fine reward of 212 wickets fell to him, while his aggregate rose to 257 wickets at 14.72 each in 1896; only Tom Richardson with 246 at 16.79 each fared nearly as well. In fact, that was Hearne's greatest year. He appeared for the Players against the Gentlemen at the Oval and Lord's, but those matches were comparatively of small importance in view of his doings against the Australians. With 56 wickets at 13.17 runs apiece he far surpassed the work of any other bowler during the summer against the touring team, though his rivals for fame included Robert Peel, George Lohmann, John Briggs, Tom Richardson and A. D. Pougher. He finished at Hastings for South of England by taking six Australian wickets for eight runs in 17 overs, 13 of them maidens. He also made 29 not out, the next highest score of his side to 53 by W. G. Grace. In the three Test matches that season he took 15 wickets at 14.1 each, dividing the honours with Tom Richardson, whose 24 wickets cost 18.7 each. At Lord's his bowling was not required until the second innings, when he sent down 36 overs for 76 runs and five wickets; but at the Oval, where Australia scored only 119 and 44, he took six wickets for 41 and four for 19--ten in all for six runs apiece, so having a large share in winning the rubber match by 66 runs."", ""An even more memorable game that season was at Lord's in June when M.C.C. avenged the disaster of 1878 by dismissing the Australians for 18, one less than the club fell for eighteen years previously. On that occasion Spofforth and Boyle brought undying fame to our visitors--in fact, made a name for Australian cricket in England. The revenge performance earned most renown for A. D. Pougher, who, going on to bowl with three wickets down for 18, disposed of five batsmen without a run being scored off him and the innings ended without addition. Yet Hearne took a greater part than did the Leicestershire bowler in gaining a single innings victory for M.C.C. In the first innings he sent down eleven overs for four runs and four wickets, and in the second, when the Australians put together a total of 183, he took, at a cost of 73 runs, all nine wickets that fell--the visitors batted one man short, Giffen being ill."", ""In the winter of 1897 he went to Australia with A. E. Stoddart, and his nine wickets for 141 in the first Test at Sydney helped materially in England's only win in the rubber of five matches, which all told yielded him no more than twenty victims. He took part in three Test matches in 1899--the first experience of a rubber of five in England--and at Leeds set up a record that still stands by doing the only hat-trick against Australia in a Test match in England. His victims were those formidable opponents Clem Hill, Sidney Gregory and M. A. Noble. He did three other hat-tricks; and another big achievement when meeting Australians occurred nine years earlier for Middlesex at Lord's, where he bowled W. L. Murdoch, the Australian captain and great batsman, for nought in each innings."", ""Besides coaching during several winters in India for the Maharaja of Patiala, Jack Hearne went to South Africa in 1891-92 and, with the two left-handers, J. J. Ferris and Nutty Martin, as colleagues, he claimed 163 wickets for less than seven runs each. South African batting was very weak at that time, and Ferris, the Australian, then qualified for Gloucestershire, with 235 wickets at 5.91 each, eclipsed Hearne's performance."", ""In fifteen different seasons Jack Hearne took over a hundred wickets; three times more than 200. From 1891 to 1904 the only exception was 1901, when the number fell to 99, partly, no doubt, because that was his best batting year with 522 runs, average 20.88. In addition to his exceptional effectiveness with the ball, Hearne scored 7,137 runs, average 11.04, and held 382 catches, mostly close to the wicket, where he was a dependable and often a brilliant fieldsman. Statistics vary as to J. T. Hearne's total wickets, but the runs scored and catches held are from Sir Home Gordon's "", '.', ""From 1891 to 1924 Hearne was engaged at Lord's, and the M.C.C. voted him, in lieu of a benefit, the sum of £500. Middlesex gave him the match with Somerset in 1900 as a benefit, and in 1920 he was elected a member of the Committee of the Middlesex County Club, an honour for a professional previously awarded only to William Gunn by Notttinghamshire in 1906. When acting as coach during many seasons at Oxford, Jack Hearne endeared himself to the University undergraduates in the same way that all who met him were impressed by the modest kindliness that marked his whole life."", 'To be on friendly terms with J.

He afforded a notable instance of hereditary talent. A son of Daniel Hayward, a player of some repute, he was a nephew of Thomas Hayward, who in the '60s was by common consent the leading professional batsman in England. \n"", 'Born at Cambridge on March 29, 1871, he belonged to a family which lived for many generations at Mitcham; both his father and grandfather appeared in the Surrey XI. Like his famous uncle he played in beautiful style. Using a straight bat he possessed all the qualities essential for success at the wicket -- unlimited patience, admirable judgment, watchfulness and strong defence. While he scored all round the wicket, his chief strokes were the cut and the off-drive. It may be questioned whether anyone ever surpassed him in making the off-drive, the stroke being executed delightfully and so admirably timed that the ball was rarely lifted. Of good height and build Hayward had remarkable powers of endurance. He first appeared for Surrey in a county match in 1893 and in 1898 played his greatest innings -- 315 not out against Lancashire at The Oval.', ""Equal in merit was his 130 for England when badly needed in the fourth match against Australia at Old Trafford in 1899. At The Oval that season Hayward and F. S. Jackson, the best batsmen in the earlier Tests, were chosen by A. C. MacLaren to open the England innings and they made 185, the amateur's share being 118. England put together 576, so beating the 551 by Australia on the Surrey ground in 1884. Hayward altogether played in 29 Tests against Australia, which he visited three times, and he also played in six matches against South Africa. An automatic choice for the Players, Hayward, in 29 matches against the Gentlemen at Lord's and The Oval, scored 2,374 runs with an average over 47."", ""For 20 years in succession, 1895-1914, he scored over 1,000 runs each season in first-class cricket. In 1904 he made 3,170, and in 1906, 3,518, which still stands as the record aggregate in first-class cricket. Hayward, 273, and Abel, 193, made a world record for the fourth wicket, 448 against Yorkshire at The Oval in 1899. Before the War -- 1905 to 1914 -- Hayward and Hobbs, also born at Cambridge, became the most notable opening pair in the game. They put up 100 or more for the first wicket on 40 occasions. In 1907 they accomplished a performance without parallel in first-class cricket by making 100 for Surrey's first wicket four times in one week: 106 and 125 against Cambridge University at The Oval; 147 and 105 against Middlesex at Lord's."", 'Hayward was the first batsman after W. G. Grace to complete 100 centuries, and altogether he reached three figures on 104 occasions, 58 times at The Oval and 88 for Surrey. In three matches he scored a hundred in each innings, excelling in 1906 by doing this twice in six days - 144 not out and 100 at Trent Bridge off the Nottinghamshire bowlers, 143 and 125 at Leicester. He carried his bat through the first innings for 225 at Nottingham, the next best score being 32. That season Hayward made 13 centuries, equalling the record set up by C. B. Fry in 1901. Eight times he carried his bat through an innings; achieved the double event in 1897 with 1,368 runs and 114 wickets, and another distinction he enjoyed was scoring 1,000 runs before the end of May in 1900.', 'When at the height of his fame as a batsman, Tom Hayward was also worth his place in the Surrey XI as a bowler. In 1897 Tom Richardson took 238 wickets at 14.55 runs each in County Championship matches, Hayward coming next with 91 with an average of 19.28. Hayward, bowling medium paced off-breaks, contrasted with Richardson, whose expresses often whipped back from off to leg stump. Leicestershire experienced the strength of this combination in 1897 on the Aylestone Road Ground where they were twice dismissed for exactly the same total - 35. Hayward took seven wickets for 43 and Richardson came out with the astonishing figures of 12 wickets for 20 runs. They bowled unchanged in each Leicestershire innings and the match was all over in a day. Between the two collapses, Surrey made 164, Hayward being top scorer with 26. In 1899 Hayward twice performed the hat-trick - against Gloucestershire at The Oval and Derbyshire at Chesterfield.', 'Putting on weight, he became rather slow in the field, though playing to the end of season 1914 but, 43 years of age when the War broke out, he did not attempt to return to active participation in the game when cricket was resumed in 1919.', 'Altogether in first-class cricket Tom Hayward scored 43,409 runs with an average of 41.69 and took 481 wickets at a cost of 22.94 each. Complete statistics of his career were supplied by the late Major R. O. Edwards for the 1921 issue of ', "". By a strange oversight the compiler missed one century. He mentions specially the 100th in June, 1913. Hayward made two other hundreds that season and two more in 1914 when Surrey last won the Championship.

The controversial conclusion of his career, as one of the first and firmest disciples of Kerry Packer, have tended to obscure his all-round accomplishments: in the mid-1970s, there was no more complete cricketer, and he bequeathed to his successor as England's captain, Mike Brearley, a thoroughly professional and close-knit side. \n"", ""Born in Queenstown, South Africa, son of a harsh and demanding Scottish father, he trialled for Sussex in 1965 as a teenager and prospered, then set himself the goal of representing England \xad following the route already described, in different circumstances, by the Cape Coloured Basil D'Oliveira. Considered good enough to represent Rest of the World when that ensemble toured Australia in 1971-2, he met his deadline by earning a Test cap for the subsequent home Ashes series, making half-centuries in each innings of his debut and taking five wickets. "", 'In fact, for a mercurial character, he showed notable consistency and versatility: he made Test matches hundreds in fields as far flung as Bombay, Bridgetown and Brisbane, and against the likes of Lillee and Thomson, Roberts and Holding, Bedi and\nChandra.  He had a homespun style, bat aloft long before it became fashionable, based on long reach and booming drives, while his bowling depended on bounce, aggression and smarts: with a sideline in off-spin, he winkled out 13 wickets at Port-of-Spain to help England draw a series in the Caribbean.', ""Greig's zenith as captain was in India, where his skill, swagger and extroversion appealed to locals even as their team was well-beaten.  More grudgingly admired in Australia, he nonetheless won great kudos from England' s bold chase in the Centenary Test.  In its aftermath, however, he made the acquaintance of Packer, another son of a harsh and demanding father, seeking to make his mark.  Greig became not just a signatory but a secret recruiting agent for the entrepreneur's inchoate professional cricket circuit.  When the enterprise was made public, his stocks plummeted: he lost not just England's captaincy, but what would have been a record-breaking benefit.  He was diminished, too, by his indifferent on-field performances in World Series Cricket, where he seemed to cast himself as pantomime villain.

He was tall with a classically looping action, and capable  of getting huge amounts of bounce and away-drift. But his qualities were  submerged amid the grim battles slow bowlers faced in the 1980s:  uncongenial pitches and one-day cricket, which forced him to become  primarily negative and defensive. He improvised more in his batting, in  which he managed to score runs while infuriating bowlers by ignoring  both footwork and backlift. Always a willing talker and theorist, he was an excellent senior pro and a promising coach (though he was fired by  Northamptonshire before returning home to Middlesex). Over-promoted  to England captain for two Tests amid general chaos in 1988, he was fired  as capriciously as he was appointed. Emburey was the only cricketer to  go on both (1981-82 and 1989-90) England rebel tours to South Africa,  and was instantly forgiven both times, which says much about attitudes  at Lord's but something about the general esteem for his qualities. \n"", ""At the end of his playing career he left Middlesex and was player-coach and then coach at Northants from 1996 to 1998 before being sacked with a year of his contract to run.

', 'The following tribute by Mr. Neville Cardus first appeared in the ', 'Charles Fry was born into a Sussex family on April 25, 1872, at Croydon, and was known first as an England cricketer and footballer, also as a great allround athlete who for a while held the long-jump record, a hunter and a fisher, and as an inexhaustible virtuoso at the best of all indoor games, conversation.', 'He was at Repton when a boy, where at cricket he joined the remarkable and enduring roll of superb young players emanating from the school -- Fry, Palairet, Ford, JN Crawford, to name a few. At Oxford he won first-class honours in Classical Moderations at Wadham, and it is a tribute to his calibre as a scholar and personal force that most of the obituary articles written after the death of Viscount Simon named Fry in a Wadham trinity with Birkenhead. Not the least doughty and idealistic of his many-sided achievements was as a Liberal candidate for Brighton, where he actually polled 20,000 votes long after he had ceased to live in Sussex and dominate the cricket field.', 'With all his versatility of mind and sinew Fry himself wished that he might be remembered, as much as for anything else, by his work in command of the training-ship ', '. For forty years he and his wife directed the ', ' at Hamble, educating youth with a classical sense of values. He once invited the present writer to visit Hamble and see his boys play cricket and perform extracts from Parsifal! Hitler sent for him for advice during the building-up of the Youth Movement in Germany. He was a deputy for the Indian delegation to the first, third, and fourth Assemblies of the League of Nations, edited his own monthly magazine more than half a century ago, and was indeed a pioneer in the school of intelligent and analytical criticism of sport. He wrote several books, including an autobiography, and a ', ', and one called ', ', which might conceivably have come from the pen of Aristotle had Aristotle lived nowadays and played cricket.', 'Fry must be counted among the most fully developed and representative Englishmen of his period; and the question arises whether, had fortune allowed him to concentrate on the things of the mind, not distracted by the lure of cricket, a lure intensified by his increasing mastery over the game, he would not have reached a high altitude in politics or critical literature. But he belonged -- and it was his glory -- to an age not obsessed by specialism; he was one of the last of the English tradition of the amateur, the connoisseur, and, in the most delightful sense of the word, the dilettante.', 'As a batsman, of course, he was thoroughly grounded in first principles. He added to his stature, in fact, by taking much thought. As a youth he did not use a bat with much natural freedom, and even in his period of pomp he was never playing as handsomely as his magnificent physical appearance seemed to suggest and deserve. He was, of course, seen often in contrast with Ranjitsinhji, who would have made all batsmen of the present day, Hutton included, look like so many plebeians toiling under the sun. Yet in his prime Fry was a noble straight-driver. He once said to me: ""I had only one stroke maybe; but it went to ten different parts of the field."" But in 1905, when the Australians decided that Fry could make runs only in front of the wicket, mainly to the on, and set the field for him accordingly, he scored 144 in an innings sparkling with cuts.', ""In his career as a cricketer, he scored some 30,000 runs, averaging 50, in an era of natural wickets, mainly against bowlers of great speed or of varied and subtle spin and accuracy. From Yorkshire bowling alone he scored nearly 2,500 runs in all his matches against the county during its most powerful days, averaging 70, in the teeth of the attack of Hirst, Rhodes, Haigh, Wainwright, and, occasionally, F. S. Jackson. In 1903 he made 234 against Yorkshire at Bradford. Next summer he made 177 against Yorkshire at Sheffield, and 229 at Brighton, in successive innings. Ranjitsinhji's performances against Yorkshire were almost as remarkable as Fry's; for he scored well over 1,500 runs against them, averaging more than sixty an innings. In 1901 Fry scored six centuries in six consecutive innings, an achievement equalled by Bradman, but on Australian wickets and spread over a season. Fry's six hundreds, two of them on bowler's wickets, came one on top of the other within little more than a fortnight."", 'The conjunction at the creases of CB Fry and KS Ranjitsinhji was a sight and an appeal to the imagination not likely ever to be repeated; Fry, nineteenth-century rationalist, batting according to first principles with a sort of moral grandeur, observing patience and abstinence. At the other end of the wicket, Ranji turned a cricket bat into a wand of conjuration. Fry was of the Occident, Ranji told of the Orient.', ""Cricket can scarcely hope again to witness two styles as fascinatingly contrasted and as racially representative as Fry's and Ranjitsinhji's. Between them they evolved a doctrine that caused a fundamental change in the tactics of batsmanship. Play back or drive. Watch the ball well, then make a stroke at the ball itself and not at a point in space where you hope the ball will presently be. At the time that Fry was making a name in cricket most batsmen played forward almost automatically on good fast pitches, frequently lunging out at full stretch. If a ball can be reached only by excessive elongation of arms and body, obviously the pitch of it has been badly gauged. Fry and Ranjitsinhji, following after Arthur Shrewsbury, developed mobile footwork."", 'It is a pungent comment on the strength of the reserves of English cricket half a century ago that Fry and Ranji were both dropped from the England team at the height of their fame. In 1901 Fry scored 3,147 runs, average 78.67; in 1903 he scored 2,683 runs, average 81.30. In 1900 Ranjitsinhji scored 3,065, average 87.57. Yet because of one or two lapses in 1902, both these great players were asked to stand down and give way to other aspirants to Test cricket.', ""As we consider Fry's enormous aggregates of runs summer by summer, we should not forget that he took part, during all the extent of his career, in only one Test match lasting more than three days, and that he never visited Australia as a cricketer. For one reason and another Fry appeared not more than eighteen times against Australia in forty-three Test matches played between 1899, when he began the England innings with W. G. Grace, and 1912, in which wet season he was England's captain against Australia and South Africa in the ill-fated triangular tournament. By that time he had severed his illustrious connection with Sussex and was opening the innings for Hampshire. The general notion is that Fry was not successful as an England batsman; and it is true that in Test matches he did not remain on his habitual peaks. None the less, his batting average for Test cricket is much the same as that of Victor Trumper, M. A. Noble, and J. T. Tyldesley. The currency had not been debased yet."", ""Until he was no-balled for throwing by Phillips -- who also called Mold at Old Trafford -- Fry was a good fast bowler who took six wickets for 78 in the University match, opened the Gentlemen's bowling against the Players at The Oval, and took five wickets. Twice he performed the hat-trick at Lord's."", 'He played Association football for his university, for the Corinthians, Southampton, and for England.', 'In his retirement he changed his methods as a writer on cricket and indulged a brisk impressionistic columnist style, to suit the running commentary needed by an evening paper: ""Ah, here comes the Don. Walking slowly to the wicket. Deliberately. Menacingly. I don\'t like the look of him. He has begun with a savage hook. He is evidently in form. Dangerously so. Ah, but he is out..."" Essentially he was an analyst by mind, if rather at the mercy of an impulsive, highly strung temperament. He sometimes, in his heyday, got on the wrong side of the crowd by his complete absorption in himself, which was mistaken for posing or egoism. He would stand classically poised after making an on-drive, contemplating the direction and grandeur of it. The cricket field has seen no sight more Grecian than the one presented by C. B. Fry in the pride and handsomeness of his young manhood.', 'After he had passed his seventieth birthday, he one day entered his club, saw his friend Denzil Batchelor, and said he had done most things but was now sighing for a new world to conquer, and proposed to interest himself in racing, attach himself to a stable, and then set up on his own. And Batchelor summed up his genius in a flash of wit: ""What as, Charles? Trainer, jockey, or horse?""', 'It is remarkable that he was not knighted for his services to cricket, and that no honours came his way for the sterling, devoted work he did with the training-ship ', 'Mr. Hubert Preston writes: Charles Fry secured a place in the Repton XI in 1888 and retained it for the next three years, being captain in 1890 and 1891. In his last season at school his average reached nearly 50.', 'When he went up to Oxford, Fry was captain of the cricket and Association football XIs and president of the athletic club, acting as first string in the 100 yards and the long-jump.', 'He also played a good deal of Rugby football, and his friends insisted that but for an unfortunate injury he would have added a Rugger Blue to his other honours. Charles Fry was also a fine boxer, a passable golfer, swimmer, sculler, tennis player and javelin thrower. But it was on the cricket field that he achieved his greatest triumphs. He represented three counties -- Sussex, Hampshire and Surrey -- scoring altogether 30,886 runs in first-class matches, average 50.22. His total of centuries reached 94 and five times he scored two separate hundreds in a match.', ""Fry's best season was 1901 when his aggregate reached 3,147, average 78.67. In that summer he scored 13 hundreds and made six in successive innings -- a feat equalled only by Sir Donald Bradman. In 1899, 1901, and 1903, Charles Fry hit a century for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, his 232 not out in 1903 remaining the highest individual score for the Gentlemen at Headquarters."", 'His one three-figure Test innings against Australia was 144 at The Oval in 1905, when the rubber had already been decided. Two years later he made his only other hundred for England, 129 against the South Africans, also at The Oval. Fry shared with Vine (J.) in thirty-three opening partnerships of 100 for Sussex.', 'Considering the very high rank he attained among batsmen, Fry, at the outset, was a stiff ungainly performer and was still somewhat laboured in stroke-production when he went up to Oxford. But from the time he began playing for Sussex with ""Ranji"" his game improved. He was a natural on-side batsman with a powerful straight drive and many useful leg-side strokes.', 'The records contain very few details of Fry\'s achievements as a bowler. Yet he figured in a somewhat heated controversy in the \'nineties about ""unfair deliveries."" Cricket writers generally regarded him as a thrower. Fry was equally insistent that all his deliveries were scrupulously fair.', 'In his writings, Fry recalled how Jim Phillips, an Australian heavyweight slow bowler turned umpire, was sent to Hove specially to ""no-ball"" him.', '""A bright move,"" commented Fry, ""because, of course, I rolled up my sleeve above my elbow and bowled with my arm as rigidly straight as a poker. The great Jim, sighting himself as a strong umpire, was not deterred. Large as an elephant, he bluffly no-balled me nine times running. It was a farce and the Sussex authorities and players were angry.', '""However, I bowled often afterwards unscathed, even in Gentlemen v. Players\' at Lord\'s and in a Test Match.""', ""Outside sport Fry's greatest work was accomplished as director of the training ship "", ', which he saved from extinction and to which he devoted forty-two years of unsparing effort entirely without remuneration. He was assisted by his wife, formerly Miss Beatrice Holme-Sumner, who died in 1941. In recognition of their work, Charles Fry was given the honorary rank of Captain in the R.N.R. and Mrs. Fry was awarded the O.B.E.', 'In his absorbing autobiography, ', ' published in 1939, Fry told of how he very nearly became the King of Albania. His association with Ranjitsinhji led him to occupy the position of substitute delegate for India at the Assemblies of the League of Nations at Geneva, where he composed a speech delivered by Ranji which turned Mussolini out of Corfu.', 'The Albanians sent a delegation and appointed a Bishop, who bore a striking resemblance to W. G. Grace, to find an English country gentlemen with £10,000 a year for their King. Fry had the first qualification but not the second; but Ranji certainly could have provided the money. ""If I had really pressed Ranji to promote me,"" said Fry, ""it is quite on the cards that I should have been King of Albania yesterday, if not today.""', 'In collaboration with his wife, he wrote the novel ', ' which was published in 1907.', 'Other tributes included:', 'Sir Pelham Warner: ""His style was stiff, but he had a cast-iron defence and played well off his pads. He put his great mental powers into improving his cricket, and that he developed into a very great batsman there can be no question.  Ranjitsinhji\'s opinion was that he was `the greatest of all batsmen of his time on all wickets and against every type of bowling.\' Perhaps his greatest innings was his 129 at The Oval in 1907 against the famous South African googly bowlers --Vogler, Faulkner, Schwarz and White -- on a wicket which ', ' says `was never easy\' and on which `the South African bowling was very difficult and the fielding was almost free from fault.\'""', 'Sir John Hobbs: ""I played with `C.B.\' in my first Test against Australia in this country. The year was 1909 and we both got blobs in the first innings. `C.B.\' persuaded Archie MacLaren, our captain, to let him go in first with me in the second innings, and we knocked off the 105 runs wanted for victory. Later he was my skipper and we always got on well together. He was a great raconteur, and my wife and I have spent many happy hours just listening to him. I saw him at Lord\'s this season.""', 'Sir Leonard Hutton: ""He was a fine judge of a cricketer and he always took the keenest interest in the progress of young players. I had a number of letters from him when I was still in the game. They were kindly, encouraging letters which contained much sound advice which I greatly appreciated.""', 'Frank Woolley: ""He was one of the most solid batsmen I ever bowled against. He had a tremendous amount of determination, especially on difficult pitches, and the patience to play the type of game required. I remember once bowling to him on a `sticky\' when the ball was turning a lot. I beat him several times in one over without getting his wicket. Next over, to my surprise, he demonstrated that I was not pitching the ball on the right spot and it was going over the stumps. That was typical of him.

Though small in stature - he stood only five feet two inches - his achievements were colossal. No county bowler ever achieved quite so consistently hypnotic an effect on opposing batsmen over a comparable period of years, and few were able to lure their opponents to destruction so inexorably under all kinds of conditions, not merely those helpful to the bowler. He was described as a wizard and magician, and expectation was rarely more keenly aroused than when his slight, gnome-like figure began its short run to the crease at the start of a spell. He was never ruffled and never happier than when bowling. His stamina was such that he would not infrequently bowl almost through the innings, whatever its length. \n', ""Freeman was born at Lewisham on May 17, 1888, a son of George Freeman, groundsman to the Streatham Cricket Club, and a younger brother of J. R. Freeman, who appeared for Essex for many years. After playing himself for Essex Club and Ground, he was taken into the Tonbridge Nursery in 1912 and showed the first signs of his skill the following year, when he took 125 wickets in all matches for Kent's second XI. He made his first-class debut in 1914, but it was not until after the First World War-when he was already 31 years of age-that he began to be the dominant force for Kent and one of the best slow bowlers of his day. Technically, he was supreme. Whether bowling the legbreak or googly or top-spinner, he always flighted and spun the ball with remarkable control of length and direction. Often his deliveries appeared innocuous, but a careful variation of flight or speed brought hundreds of batsmen, who had been deceived into false security, to their grief. He was aided during his years with Kent by two very fine wicketkeepers, J. C. Hubble and L. E. G. Ames, whose stumpings off Freeman were one of the most regular features in county cricket of the 1920s and '30s."", ""It is essentially as a county bowler that Freeman will be remembered, for though he played 12 times for England he rarely produced his best when not playing for Kent. Seventeen times he took 100 wickets in a season (a record exceeded only by Wilfred Rhodes) and in each of eight consecutive seasons -1928 to 1935 - he took over 200 wickets. His total aggregate in this period was 2,090. He is the only bowler in history to capture 300 wickets in one season, dismissing the phenomenal number of 304 batsmen (at 18.05 each) in the dry summer of 1928. Five years later his season's tally was 298. His records are legion-the result of amazing consistency and mastery of his craft. No other bowler has three times taken all ten wickets in a first-class innings, and no other bowler has twice taken 17 wickets in a championship match: in the course of one of these latter achievements against Sussex at Hove in 1922-he had the remarkable analysis of 9 for 11 in the first innings, actually taking all 9 wickets in 47 balls for 7 runs. The succession of prodigious bowling feats that characterised his career placed him behind only Wilfred Rhodes as the greatest wicket-taker in the first-class game: Freeman's final aggregate in a career which stretched from 1914 to 1936 was 3,776 at an average of 18.42."", ""He toured Australia and New Zealand under A. C. MacLaren in 1922-23 and was a member of the M.C.C. sides to Australia in 1924-25 (when he played in two Tests) and 1928-29. He also played in four Tests when touring South Africa in 1927-28, and in England played in Tests against both West Indies and South Africa. He took 66 wickets for England at 25.86 each. He also played five times for the Players at Lord's. As a batsman he had few pretensions, but on his Test debut in 1924-25 he scored 50 not out against Australia at Sydney. He was a right-hander who could sometimes hit hard, and though he was a regular number 10 or 11, he made over 4,000 runs for Kent, including an innings of 66 in 70 minutes at Old Trafford in 1925. He was also an excellent cover-point."", 'After retiring from first-class cricket he became professional with Walsall in the Birmingham and District League in 1937 and 1938, establishing a club record in 1937 with 98 wickets (av. 8.27), including 10 for 44 versus Dudley and 9 for 21 versus Moseley. As far on as 1946, when he was aged 58, he played for Old England against Surrey at the Oval. In 1949 he was one of the former professional cricketers who were made honorary life members of M.C.C.\n', ""\nFreeman, Alfred Percy, who died on January 28, aged 76, was one of the finest slow bowlers the game has known. He played as a professional for Kent from 1914 to 1936 taking 3,776 wickets an average cost of 18.42 runs each and between 1924 and 1929 appeared in twelve Test matches for England. Only one man, W. Rhodes with 4,187 wickets, has met with greater success. Freeman's wonderfully well controlled leg-breaks, with a skilfully disguised googly or top-spinner interspersed, his well-nigh perfect length and cunning flighting frequently puzzled the most experienced opponents and on no fewer than 17 occasions he dismissed 100 or more batsmen in a season."", 'His most triumphant summer was that of 1928, when his victims totalled 304 for 18.15 runs each, a feat without parallel in first-class cricket, and five years later he took 298. His wickets exceeded 200 in five other seasons: 276 in 1931, 275 in 1930, 253 in 1932, 212 in 1935 and 205 in 1934. Three times - a feat unequalled by any other bowler - this short but stockily-built man, known in the cricket world as ""Tich"", took all 10 wickets in an innings, against Lancashire for 131 runs at Maidstone in 1929, and that despite an innings of 126 by F.

He toured Australia and New Zealand with A. C MacLaren\'s M.C.C. team in 1922-23 and made his first appearance for England in Australia in 1924-25. Though he did reasonably well in other matches, he took only eight wickets in two Tests and conceded 519 runs. Nor did he achieve anything of note when visiting South Africa in 1927-28, his total wickets in four Tests amounting to 14 at an average cost of 28.50. In home Tests he fared better. Against the West Indies in 1928 he headed the averages with 22 wickets at 13.72 runs apiece, including 10 for 93 at Old Trafford. For Kent against the West Indies team at Canterbury he took nine wickets in the second innings for 104 runs. He also topped the England bowling figures against South Africa the following season, dismissing 12 men for 171 runs at Old Trafford and seven for 115 in the first innings at Leeds.', 'When Kent, who gave him two benefits, dispensed with his services at 1936, Freeman played for a time as professional for Walsall in the Birmingham and District League.

In 1998-99 she scored her maiden Test hundred against India but, while still scoring runs, she did not score as many runs as had been expected. In 2000, she was sidelined by a serious cruciate ligament injury sustained while playing hockey which caused her to miss almost all of the 2001 season.

March 26, 1916, Lingwood, Norfolk ","April 24, 1986, Whitehill Court, Chesham, Buckinghamshire (aged 70 years 29 days) ",,"['England,', 'Middlesex,', 'Norfolk']","Bracondale School, Norwich",,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm fast,,"['Brother - ', ',', 'Brother - ', ',', 'Brother - ', ',', 'Cousin - ']",,"['\n', '\nBill Edrich, who died at Chesham as the result of an accident on April 24, 1986, aged 70, was a cricketer who would have been the answer to prayer in the troubled  England sides of today. Endlessly cheerful, always optimistic and physically courageous, he was a splendid hitter of short-pitched fast bowling and took the blows he received as a part of the game. When he made 16 in an hour and three-quarters on a hideous wicket at  Brisbane in the  first innings of the first Test in  1946-47, an  innings which ', "" correspondent described as  one of the most skilful batting displays I have ever seen, it was reckoned that he was hit ten times by  Lindwall,  Miller and  Toshack. So far from being demoralised by this experience, he scored in the  series 462 runs with an average of 46.20, and that for a side which lost three Tests, two of them by an  innings, and drew the other two. Moreover, his cricket did not end with his batting. Though he stood only 5ft 6in tall, and had a low, slinging action, he could off a run of eleven strides bowl genuinely fast for a few overs. Admittedly it was a terrible proof of the weakness of English bowling after the war that at this period he often had to open in Test matches. It is barely credible that in  1950, when his 22 wickets in the season cost him just under 50 runs each, he opened in both of  West Indies' innings at  Lord's. In fairness it must be added that  Walcott, who made 168 not out in the  second innings, was missed off him in the slips at 9. Still, in a reasonably strong side he was a valuable change as a fifth or sixth bowler, always apt to upset a good batsman by his unexpected speed. Like many natural athletes, he originally made a reputation as a tireless outfielder, but he was soon found to be too valuable in the slips to spend much time elsewhere. One way and another he was always in the game, always trying his hardest. \n"", ""He came of a Norfolk farming family, which sometimes produced its own XI. Three of his brothers played with some success in first-class cricket and his cousin, John, had later a distinguished  Test match career.  Bill Edrich first appeared for  Norfolk in  1932 at the age of sixteen, and by  1936 had scored 1,886 runs for them in the  Minor Counties Championship alone, not to mention an  innings of 111 against the  1935 South African side. By then he had begun to qualify for  Middlesex, and in  1936 he made three hundreds in first-class cricket for  MCC and came second in the first-class averages with an average of 55. So it was no surprise when next year, in his first full season of first-class cricket, he scored 2,154 runs with an average of 44.87, heading the batting, and was picked for  Lord Tennyson's side in  India. In  1938 he started by making 1,000 runs before the end of May, a target he achieved only with the help of an unexpectedly generous action by  Bradman who, captaining the  Australians against  Middlesex on May 31, made an otherwise meaningless declaration to give him a chance of getting the last 20 runs. After this feat his place in the  England side was secure; so secure that he kept it right through the  series even though failure followed failure and six  innings produced only 67 runs. In the following winter, as a member of the side to  South Africa, his ill luck pursued him, five  innings bringing 21 runs. At last, in the  second innings of the timeless  fifth Test, when  England were set 696 to win, he saved the side by batting 7 hours, 40 minutes for 219. Timeless or not, the match was abandoned when the score stood at 654 for five: the rain came down, everyone had enough, and the Englishmen left to catch their boat."", ""The sequel to this  innings is perhaps the strangest part of the story. There can surely be no parallel for a batsman failing in eight consecutive Tests and yet keeping his place, but one would at any rate expect that, when he had at last justified the selectors' confidence, he would have retained it. Instead, in  1939, though his average for the season was 49.68, he did not play in a Test against the  West Indians, and in  1946, when Test cricket was resumed after seven years' interval, he had only one match against  India and did not bat in that. Moreover he was only a late choice for the  1946-47 tour of  Australia. Let anyone justify these inconsistencies who can."", ""During the war Edrich had joined the RAF and had a distinguished career, winning the DFC as a bomber pilot. Up to the war he had played as a professional; after it he became an amateur. Furthermore, until  1938 he had normally opened the  innings. When he played his great innings in  South Africa, he had been moved down the order, and in  1939 Brown and  Robertson established themselves in the  Middlesex side as a great opening  pair. Thenceforward  Edrich's normal place was first wicket. It was in  Australia in  1946-47 that he showed himself indisputably a Test player. His batting in the  first Test has been mentioned. In the second he scored 71 and 119 and made a gallant attempt to stave off an  innings defeat. He followed this with 89 in the  third Test and 60 in the fifth."", 'In  England in  1947 came his ', "". Scoring in all 3,539 runs with an average of 80.43 he beat  Hayward's 41-year-old aggregate of 3,518: however,  Compton beat it by even more. What is not sufficiently appreciated is that, but for a strained arm, which stopped him bowling after the beginning of August, he might well have equalled  J. H. Parks's astonishing record of 3,000 runs and 100 wickets:  Edrich had already taken 67 wickets. In  1946 he had taken 73 at 19.28. In the Tests in  1947 against  South Africa he made 552 runs with an average of 110.40. At  Manchester he made 191, adding 228 with  Compton for the third wicket in 196 minutes. At  Lord's in the previous Test, also for the third wicket, they had added 370.  Edrich made 189."", ""In  1948, in the disastrous  series against  Australia, his sole notable contribution was 111 in the  fourth Test at  Leeds, but next year against  New Zealand he averaged 54 with only one century. In  1950 he contributed a typically gallant 71 in the  second innings of the  first Test at  Manchester, but at  Lord's in the second he failed abjectly in each  innings. His scores were 8 and 8: it would have been better for his reputation if he had taken two first balls. Each time he stayed long enough to make it clear that he was completely out of his depth with  Ramadhin and  Valentine. Nothing worse for the morale of the younger members of the side can be imagined. Inevitably he was dropped for the two remaining Tests, but for  Middlesex he scored much as usual and it was a great surprise when he was omitted from the team for  Australia at the end of the season. The  Australians themselves were astonished, and when the side proved to be incontestably the worst batting one  England had ever sent out, and all the new choices were failures, there were those who thought that his courage and experience might have turned the scale in a series which was closer than the results indicated. No reasons were given at the time for his omission, but in fact an ill-advised late-night party during the  first Test against  West Indies, followed by his calamitous showing in the second, had convinced the selectors, and not least the captain elect, that the team would be better without him. By a generous gesture  Edrich himself was at the station to see the team off and to wish them well."", ""Although few could have foreseen it at the time, this was the beginning of the end for  Edrich. Never again was he to be the force in Tests that he had been. Recalled as  Hutton's opening partner for the last three Tests against  Australia in  1953, he made 64 at  Leeds and was 55 not out when the Ashes were regained at  The Oval after a period of eighteen years. But he did not do much in his one Test against  Pakistan in  1954, and although at the end of that summer he was picked for  Australia, only a fighting 88 in the  second innings of the  first Test showed what he could once do. That was the end of his career for  England. For  Middlesex he still made runs, if not on the scale of his great years. In  1951 and  1952 he shared the captaincy with  Compton: this, like most such diarchies, was not a success. From  1953, he was sole captain, a position in which he certainly could not be blamed for lack of enterprise. At last in 1957, though he got his 1,000 runs, for the fifteenth time his average dropped to 22.92 and he felt it was time to resign. Next year he played in about half the matches with only moderate results, and at the end of the season he accepted the captaincy of Norfolk, for whom he continued to score runs and to take wickets with slow off-breaks until 1972."", 'When his first-class career ended he was 42, an age at which many great batsmen have still been batting with almost undiminished powers. However, Edrich had always relied rather on his natural gifts, his wonderful eye, his physical strength and courage than on a studiously sound technique. Granted that he was always well behind the ball when playing a fast bowler, he had a markedly right-handed grip and his best strokes were the  cut, the  hook and the pulled drive. His bat did not have that pendulum-like swing up and down the line which is the foundation of real soundness. Still, he had done enough for the fame and had given much pleasure to many thousands of spectators.', 'In first-class cricket he had scored 36,965 runs, with an average of 42.39 and made 86 centuries, nine of them double-centuries: he took 479 wickets at 33.31 and held 526 catches. His highest score was 267 not out for  Middlesex against  Northamptonshire at Northampton in  1947. For Middlesex his figures were 25,738 runs with an average of 43.40 and 328 wickets at 30.41, and in Tests he made 2,440 runs with an average of 40, including six hundreds: he also took 41 wickets at 41.29 and held 39 catches.', '\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1940'],39.0,63.0,2.0,2440.0,219,40.0,,,6.0,13.0,,9.0,39.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,571.0,964,92,36965,267*,42.39,,,86,197,,,527.0,1.0,4.0,4,0,48,36,12.00,,,0,0,,,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39.0,51,3234,1693,41.0,4/68,8/172,41.29,3.14,78.8,3,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,571.0,,32942,15956,479,7/48,,33.31,2.90,68.7,,11,3,4.0,,70,76,2,2/76,2/76,38.00,6.51,35.0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Brought on to bowl in mid-afternoon, he took 5 for 17 in his first 12 overs of Test cricket. In and out of the England side throughout his career, often second choice to Derek Underwood, he was also an excellent field, a determined lower-order batsman with first-class centuries to his credit and a fierce competitor. His strength was his thoughtful, very accurate bowling, with enough spin to beat the bat on any wicket giving assistance to the spinners. \n', 'Phil Edmonds was England\'s leading slow left arm bowler of the 1980s, though he played less Test cricket than he might have done because he was perceived by selectors to be ""difficult"". He had the aggressive streak of a fast bowler, and wasn\'t afraid to bowl the odd bouncer if the batman started to irritate him.  For a time he had problems with his run-up, to the extent that on tour in India he had to resort to bowling off one step, and the fact that his effectiveness was not diminished by this was a testament to his strong shoulders and good bowling action.

 ","['\nIt is more than 150 years since WG Grace was born, but there are other ways of measuring how distant he is in time. For one thing, no one still alive, not even Jim Swanton, can remember seeing him play (although in ', ', EWS notes that ""I am supposed to have watched [him] from my perambulator on the Forest Hill ground round 1910""). Eight decades have passed since Grace died, yet he dogs us still, demanding our attention at regular intervals. \n', ""The statistics of his career are alone enough to explain why - more than 54,000 first-class runs (there are at least two different versions of the precise figure, so let's leave it at that) spread across 44 seasons, including 839 in just eight days of 1876, when he hit a couple of triple-centuries, and only one other batsman managed to top a thousand runs in the entire season; a thousand in May in 1895, when he was nearly 47; and 2800-odd wickets costing less than 18 runs apiece. I suppose we might wonder why his bowling average wasn't even more impressive, given the ropey pitches on which Dr Grace played. No modern cricketer would deign to turn out on them, which makes his batting all the more wondrous, and comparisons with Bradman or anyone since quite pointless."", 'But there was not that much to Grace apart from these skills and his devotion to his family. A hand of whist appears to have marked the limit of his capacity for cerebration, and if one wished to be rude to suburbia one might identify Grace as suburban man incarnate, fluctuating mentally as well as physically between the fringes of Bristol and the London Counties, ultimately coming to rest in Eltham. His one inherited asset was that he came from a clan which was dotty about a great game and dutiful (but in some cases no more) about the general practice of medicine, with no doubt in its collective mind which came first at all times and in all places. His brother EM Grace, who was a coroner, once had a corpse put on ice until he could attend to it at close of play, and WG himself must have had one of the most prolonged medical trainings in history because he so frequently interrupted it in order to exercise his major talent at the crease. He began to study as a bachelor of 19, and was a father of three in his thirties before taking his final qualification at Westminster Hospital. His most conspicuous act as a doctor is thought to have occurred when an unfortunate fieldsman impaled himself on the boundary fence at Old Trafford.', ""It was simply because the cricketing Grace totally dominated his own era that an exasperated CLR James could not understand why standard history books of the period never mentioned him. This man, for heaven's sake, opened for England at the age of 50 - and at the age of 18 he had scored 224 not out for England against Surrey, in a match which he left halfway through in order to win a quarter-mile hurdles championship at the Crystal Palace! No wonder he was the best-known Englishman apart from Mr Gladstone, so much so that Evelyn Waugh's friend, Monsignor Ronnie Knox, waggishly suggested that Gladstone and Grace were really one and the same celebrity."", 'Athletic is not a word that obviously comes to mind when contemplating Grace in his prime, though a slim young man did precede the pot-bellied genius, who in middle age was far too heavy for any horse to bear. I have often wondered how stylishly he played his strokes ever since I saw some film in which he appeared to be brandishing his bat as though he was about to poke the fire with it. Something tells me that he never hit the ball as gracefully as Victor Trumper did in the famous photo of his straight drive; Grace, I suspect, was much more about power than aesthetics.', 'That, at any rate, would fit what we know of his character in general. Apart from tenderness to his relatives and a generous soft spot for children, he was not, I think, a particularly attractive man, though he could sometimes (and it is usually recorded as remarkable) encourage a young player on his own side with - as the saying went in his day - bluff good humour. After the Australians had experienced him for the first time, a commentator Down Under observed that, ""For so big a man, he is surprisingly tenacious on very small points."" He was notorious for employing, in order to pursue victory or personal achievement, a variety of wiles and tricks that may be thought of as, well, hardly cricket. He was also, throughout his career, quite breathtakingly grasping when his eye caught the glint of hard cash.', ""It was the social historian Eric Midwinter who, some years ago, pointed out that on Grace's first tour of Australia in 1873-74 (when he was a medical student simultaneously enjoying his honeymoon) he extracted a fee of £1500 from the organisers, which would be well over £100,000 at present values. On his second tour in 1891-92, one-fifth of the entire cost of transporting 13 English cricketers across the world, supporting them in Australia and paying them for what they did there, went into Grace's pocket. He regularly collected testimonials - one, worth £1458, was organised by MCC so that he might buy a medical practice - and overall probably took something like £1 million in today's currency out of the game; and, remember, there was no sponsorship nor endorsements in those days to inflate a star's income. This was in a period when the prosperous middle classes were earning no more than £1000 a year, a highly skilled artisan £200, and a labourer half as much if he was lucky. A good professional county cricketer in the second half of the 19th century saw his wages rise from £100 to £250. No wonder it cost twice as much to get into some English grounds if Grace was playing than if he was not."", 'The astonishing thing about the mercenary Grace, of course, is that he was classified and has ever since been glorified as an amateur. Nothing more exposed the humbug that used to smother the entire topic of Gents v Players than an examination of Grace\'s financial rewards from the game; and nothing more reveals the intellectual dishonesty at the heart of the humbug than something Grace once said when trying to argue the Gloucestershire committee into playing more amateurs than professionals. He declared his fear for the future of cricket if it became wholly professional. ""Betting and all kindred evils will follow in its wake, and instead of the game being followed up for love, it will simply be a matter of £ s d."" Prophetic words, perhaps; but it ill became WG Grace to mouth them.', 'It will be gathered from the above that he has never been a hero of mine, not since the day in adolescence when I discovered that he was sometimes a shameless cheat in a game that, I was being asked to believe, was wholly honourable. I shall nevertheless drink to his memory on July 18 because his tremendous gifts, especially his phenomenal batting, were largely responsible for the elevation of cricket from just another 19th-century game, which had become popular partly because it lent itself to gambling.', ""Grace's towering presence, more than any other single factor, transformed it into the unrivalled spectator sport of summer, first of all in England, subsequently in other lands spread widely across the world. I would even suggest that a true measurement of WG's unique stature is that he is instantly identifiable, even by some who are uninterested in his vocation, by his initials alone. I cannot think of another human being in any sphere, not even WC Fields, of whom this is also true.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1896'],22.0,36.0,2.0,1098.0,170,32.29,,,2.0,5.0,,1.0,39.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,870.0,1478,104,54211,344,39.45,,,124,251,,,876.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22.0,13,666,236,9.0,2/12,3/68,26.22,2.12,74.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,870.0,,124831,50980,2809,10/49,,18.14,2.45,44.4,,240,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

In Tests he averaged 31 with bat, and 32 with ball. For all the talk of fearsome fast bowling, only three five-fors featured among his 226 wickets. His one-day figures were good without being outstanding, and his Lancashire ones nothing special. But what the stats don't show is his presence, and the uplifting effect that Flintoff at his finest had on his team-mates, and crowds. The game treasures few things more than an all-action allrounder. Flintoff became one of English cricket's iconic figures and his presence helped to gain the game popularity as the new century developed."", ' \n', '""Freddie"" was selected for England in 1998 as much on promise as performance, and underperformed at first, not helped by problems with weight and attitude. He was always a big man - 6ft 4ins and anywhere from 15-17 stone, depending on the recent calorie count - and the strain of juggernauting in and bowling at 90mph was inevitably a strain: his knees and ankles took multiple poundings from pitches and surgeons\' scalpels.', ""He was always a correct, powerful batsman, sometimes hesitant against quality spin. His bowling was always wholehearted and occasionally magnificent, when he was probing away outside off with a hint of reverse swing at high pace. But it wasn't until the New Zealand tour early in 2002 that Flintoff finally scored a Test century or took more than four wickets in a match. He looked established at last - but then another injury kept him out of the 2002-03 Ashes, although he was fit enough for the World Cup that followed in South Africa, where he was the most economical bowler on view."", ""That kicked off Flintoff's golden period - three home seasons when he was at his princely peak. First there was 2003, when a six off Makhaya Ntini was still rising as it thudded into the Bedser Stand at The Oval. In 2004 he finally slipped the handbrake and bowled at his fastest - and also smacked a rollicking Test-best 167 against West Indies at Edgbaston, when one of his seven sixes was memorably dropped by his father in the stands. And then there was the crowning glory of 2005, when he bestrode the Ashes series and was undoubtedly the leading cricketer in the world, a fact acknowledged by Wisden. The photograph of him consoling Brett Lee after England narrowly beat Australia at Edgbaston became the photograph to capture one of the great Test series."", 'After that, his body started rebelling. To make matters worse he was subsequently horribly miscast as captain in Australia in 2006-07, sometimes looking forlorn as his team sunk to a 5-0 whitewash.

It was  an amazing achievement, especially for a man who gave the impression that he was constantly on the brink of walking out in disgust.  \n', ""His enigmatic qualities seemed almost cultivated.

West Indies were blown away for 47, and Harmison's figures of 7 for 12 were the best in Tests at Sabina Park. It was a stunning riposte from a man who, only months earlier, had flown home injured from England's tour of Bangladesh with whispers about his diffidence chasing him all the way. But as much as Jamaica 2004 set the benchmark, Brisbane 2006 proved a low point as his opening delivery of the Ashes series went straight to Andrew Flintoff at second slip and his desire was once again questioned. \n"", 'Harmison, who was born in Ashington - the Northumberland village where the footballing Charlton brothers first saw the light of day - was barely 20 when he went with England A to South Africa in 1998-99, but after that he was held back by a series of niggling injuries - including somehow dislocating his shoulder when he caught his hand in his trouser pocket while bowling - and a tendency to fall homesick when confined to barracks on overseas tours. He eventually broke into the Test team in mid-2002, after an injury to another tearaway, Simon Jones, but for a long time he was no better than promising, with a tendency to mix magical spells with moments when the radar would go badly awry. But, in the Caribbean, the spiritual home of the fast bowler, he seemed to have finally come of age.', ""This was born out in the 2004 Test series against West Indies and New Zealand, where he plundered wickets aplenty as England completed a 7-0 clean sweep. But in South Africa the following winter, the doubts crept back in and after ending a miserable Test series with a niggling calf strain, he admitted to the press that he had been hoping to fail his fitness test in order to be allowed home early. Against Bangladesh the following summer, he took a cathartic five-wicket haul in front of his home crowd in Durham, before tearing into Australia's top-order with five wickets on the first morning of the Ashes series at Lord's. He couldn't secure victory on that occasion, but popped up with the most vital strike of his life one Test later, to seal a thrilling two-run win at Edgbaston and set England on their way to an historic Ashes triumph. "", ""Persistent shin problems hampered his form for the rest of the year, but against Pakistan at Old Trafford in July 2006, he was back to his rampant best, taking 11 wickets in a thumping innings win. That didn't last as his one-day nightmares continued at the Champions Trophy and he entered the first Test at Brisbane woefully short of match fitness. The result was that wide which, as much as his striking of Justin Langer at Lord's in 2005, set the tone for the series. Harmison was anonymous for the first two Tests before finally showing some form in the final three matches - but by then it was too late. After the Perth defeat handed the Ashes back to Australia, Harmison announced his retirement from ODIs, a decision he'd made after the Champions Trophy. It continued to leave more questions than answers. A reputation, and a career, hung in the balance and although he began 2007 in fine style for Durham, his winter nightmares continued to hamper him in the opening Tests against West Indies. A back injury ended his summer prematurely and, in October, was asked by the England management to prove his fitness and form by playing in South African domestic cricket. He came through the subsequent tour of Sri Lanka with credit, despite missing the first Test with back problems, but he was dropped one Test later in New Zealand, after an abject display in a humiliating England defeat at Hamilton."", 'After being sent back to Durham, he found fiery form for his county and earned a recall for the fourth Test against South Africa. Following a successful return to international colours at The Oval, he was subsequently persuaded by new captain Kevin Pietersen to come out of one-day retirement to face South Africa, and he even went to Antigua to take part in the Stanford Super Series. But before the winter was out the doubts about his commitment had resurfaced once again. He played a peripheral role as England reclaimed the Ashes in the summer of 2009 - returning only for the final two Tests - and when he subsequently lost his ECB central contract and ditched for the tour of South Africa, most observers assumed that this time, it really was the end.', ""Harmison continued to perform for Durham, albeit inconsistently, and he was rewarded for his contribution to the county's success when he was awarded a benefit in 2013, recognition of his role in two County Championship titles, in 2008 and 2009, when he was leading wicket-taker on both occasions. \n""]","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1998', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005']",63.0,86,23,743.0,49*,11.79,1299,57.19,0,0,97,10,7.0,0.0,58.0,25,14,91.0,18*,8.27,141,64.53,0,0,3,0,10.0,0.0,2.0,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,86.9,-,-,-,-,1.0,0.0,211.0,270,77,1888,49*,9.78,,,0,0,,,31,0,143.0,67,34,267,25*,8.09,,,0,0,,,23,0,28.0,6,1,11,6,2.20,13,84.61,0,0,2,0,3,0,63.0,115,13375,7192,226.0,7/12,11/76,31.82,3.22,59.1,11,8,1,58.0,57,2899,2481,76.0,5/33,5/33,32.64,5.13,38.1,2,1,0,2.0,2,39,42,1.0,1/13,1/13,42.00,6.46,39.0,0,0,0,211.0,,39374,20805,744,7/12,,27.96,3.17,52.9,,27,1,143.0,,6838,5658,184,5/33,5/33,30.75,4.96,37.1,6,1,0,28.0,25,505,668,29,5/41,5/41,23.03,7.93,17.4,2,1,0,False,False,False,False

Despite his gifts, and popularity, he was always happier in the small pond of Essex, whom he captained to three Championships, including their first in 1979. At Test level a somewhat apologetic air seemed to bring out the bully in fast bowlers: he never fully recaptured his composure after the attentions of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in 1974-75. One ball in particular left a lasting mental scar - a flyer from Thommo at Sydney that ricocheted at such pace from gloves to cap-badge that Fletcher was almost caught at cover. Seven years later, 47 Tests after he had apparently been finally discarded, the selectors turned to him to captain England in India after Mike Brearley\'s retirement. But Fletcher became illogically defensive after defeat in the first Test at Bombay. He convinced himself that the umpires would protect India if England made a winning opening, and appeared to settle for a 0-1 series defeat, playing out five successive dreary draws.

In point of style and suppleness of movement at the crease he could stand comparison with the greatest exponents of the art of batsmanship. He may have lacked the majesty of Hammond or the feline grace of Sobers, but his batting had a certain sheen and glamour about it, all its own. From an early age he had shown clear signs of cricketing ability, receiving invaluable advice from his father, Joe, a highly respected Nottinghamshire and England batsman and later a Test match umpire. When, at the age of sixteen, he was recommended to the Nottinghamshire authorities by Larwood, he proved to be an extremely apt pupil, and in 1930, aged nineteen he seized his chance by making 53 not out in only his second Championship match. There followed three seasons of consolidation, his captain, Arthur Carr, preferring to nurse him along in the lower order. Carr's patience and judgement proved correct; in 1934 the young man's batting blossomed to the tune of 1,817 runs, including four hundreds. By now he had settled in at No. 4, becoming an integral part of one of the strongest batting sides in the country, and maintaining his form he played in his first Test, against South Africa, in 1935. Chosen for MCC's tour of Australia and New Zealand under E. R. T. Holmes in 1935-36, he was an outstanding success with 1,044 runs in first-class matches, his innings of 230 not out against an Australian XI at Melbourne making such an impression that his future at the highest level seemed assured. Another productive season followed in 1936, including 94 against India at Old Trafford, but on the Ashes tour of 1936-37 his form largely deserted him on the big occasions. He played in all the Tests, but 83 in a lost cause at Melbourne in the final one was his best effort by some way. \n"", ""However, the disappointing tour gave way to a summer rich in achievement. Looking much sounder in method, Hardstaff made 1937 a memorable year by scoring 2,540 runs, hitting three double-hundreds and five other three-figure scores, and finishing second to Hammond in the averages with 57.72. In August alone he scored 1,150 runs. During Canterbury Week, he produced a phenomenal innings of 126 as Nottinghamshire achieved 310 in three hours to win with 45 minutes to spare. Scoring largely in front of the wicket, he reached 100 in just 51 minutes, which was to win him the Lawrence Trophy, and hit 117 out of 134 scored in an hour. In Nottinghamshire's first innings he had batted three hours for 97, and he showed similar resolve in making 243 to save the game against Middlesex at Trent Bridge when his side were facing a heavy defeat. Moreover, his innings, containing two sixes and 31 fours, had a decisive influence on the outcome of the Championship; until then, Middlesex and Yorkshire had been engaged in a thrilling two-horse race. In the Tests against New Zealand he recovered lost ground by hitting two hundreds and making 350 runs with an average of 70.00, but though he maintained this splendid form in 1938, he could not find a place in England's line-up against Australia at Trent Bridge or Lord's. Failure at Leeds on a difficult pitch was made amends for by 169 not out at The Oval, where he added 215 for the sixth wicket with Hutton (364). There was general surprise when he was not chosen to tour South Africa in that winter. In the last pre-war season he was again in fine form, averaging more than 50 and making five hundreds, and he played in all three Tests against West Indies."", "" Hardstaff was deprived by the war of what would have been six productive seasons. As it was, he came home in November 1945 after three years on the Burma front and the following June announced his fitness and form with 205 not out against India in front of a full house at Lord's. This promised well for the continuation of his Test career, yet he could not command a regular place. On his third tour of Australia, in 1946-47, he played in only one Test, and in 1947, when he repeated his 1937 feat of hitting three double-hundreds and had the splendid aggregate of 2,396 runs with an average of 64.75, he did not play in one of the five Tests against the South Africans. He had fair success in the West Indies in 1947-48, although never happy under Allen's leadership, but the First Test against the Australians in 1948-when in front of his home crowd he helped Compton put on 93 for the fourth wicket in an atrocious light as England were batting to save the game--proved to be his last. In 23 Tests he had scored 1,636 runs at an average of 46.74."", 'At county level he remained a formidable player. In 1949 he headed the national averages with 72.61 from 2,251, including eight hundreds, and by the time he retired at the end of the 1955 season he had scored 31,847 runs at an average of 44.35. His 83 hundreds included ten double-hundreds, with a highest score of 266 at Leicester in 1937. In addition to 1935-36 in Australia and New Zealand, he passed 1,000 runs thirteen times, going on to 2,000 four times, and he took 123 catches.', 'But the figures tell only half the story. Nurtured on the perfect Trent Bridge pitches of the 1930s. Hardstaff stood erect like a sentinel at the crease, hands high up the handle, and he was beautifully poised for attack or defence. Tall, slim and a natural athlete, he drove superbly through the covers, and could cut and force the ball away with wrists of steel generating the power. His footwork, neat and polished, would bring him effortlessly into line for the stroke he needed. He will be remembered also for his running, gathering and throwing in the deep, all of which were in the highest class; less so for his occasionally useful medium-pace bowling.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1938'],23.0,38,3,1636.0,205*,46.74,,,4,10,,3,9.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,517.0,812,94,31847,266,44.35,,,83,166,,,123,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,517.0,,3890,2141,36,4/43,,59.47,3.30,108.0,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Pinging the ball down from the clouds he has the heady blend of pace and trampolining bounce to rattle the best players.  At his best, his potential looks immense, but he is a gentle character given to periods of technical self-doubt and his career has often been fraught with uncertainty. \n"", 'Finn\'s career went into reverse in 2013/14. Issues with his delivery stride - a habit of kneeing the stumps led to a Law change making it a no-ball - and control meant he has been in and out of the side. Endless tinkering with his action then left him visibly bereft of confidence. He was the only member of England\'s vanquished Ashes Test squad not to play in the 5-0 whitewash and cut a forlorn figure on the practice grounds as his action was stripped right back to basics. It all led to him being sent home from England\'s tour of Australia after being deemed ""not selectable"" - an honest and sympathetic assessment - by his one-day coach Ashley Giles.', ""What followed was a long period of rehabilitation and many long hours in winter nets at Finchley CC. In 2014, his 48 first-class wickets showed progress, even if his pace and consistency were inconsistent, but the input of a host of coaches slowly brought dividends and led to his return in England's victorious Ashes series after a two-year absence in which he had been limited only to limited-overs appearances for his country. The unveiling of a new outswinger and the particular joy of a six-wicket haul at Edgbaston gave him the confidence to pronounce that the past was behind him."", ""Finn made his county debut for Middlesex as a 16-year-old in 2005, the youngest to do so since Fred Titmus in 1949, and was earmarked as an England prospect from his early days, representing England at all age-group levels from Under-16s upwards. He enjoyed a solid 2009 season for Middlesex, taking 53 wickets at 30.64 in the Championship, and then did well for England Lions in the UAE. With Stuart Broad, Graham Onions and Ryan Sidebottom all picking up injuries early on England's tour to Bangladesh, Finn was parachuted in as cover. Barely 24 hours after arriving in the country he was playing in the warm-up game against Bangladesh A and impressed on his Test debut three days later, displaying good pace and bounce on a docile Chittagong surface."", ""With the England management desperately searching for a consistent replacement for Steve Harmison, Finn marked his home debut, also against Bangladesh, in style. In the familiar surroundings of Lord's, he carried a rusty England attack with 4 for 100 in the first innings and went one better in the second, taking 5 for 87 to finish with nine in the game and the man-of-the-match medal in just his third Test."", ""He kept his place against Pakistan and despite doubts as to whether he was ready for the challenge of a tour of Australia, Finn fronted up impressively in his early outings. He claimed a career-best 6 for 125 to help turn the tide in the first Test at the Gabba, before stepping into the breach left by an injury to Stuart Broad to help seal victory in the second Test at Adelaide. Though he faded at Perth and was omitted from the last two matches, he'd done enough to confirm his promise."", 'A single Test appearance in 2011 followed, during which he became the youngest Englishman to 50 wickets, but Tim Bresnan and Chris Tremlett moved ahead of him in third-seamer pecking order. An impressive tour of India pushed him firmly into one-day contention, however, and he was a virtual ever-present in limited-overs cricket in 2012, as England briefly topped the ODI rankings but failed in their World Twenty20 defence.', ""Finn won a Test recall against South Africa but a habit of hitting the stumps in his delivery stride became costly when Graeme Smith drew attention to it at Headingley. The umpires decided to call dead ball and Finn was denied Smith's wicket. A few months later, 'Finn's Law' was created, making any wicket taken after a bowler had knocked over the stumps a no ball. "", ""Injury curtailed Finn's involvement in the historic Test series win in India but he was back in the XI in New Zealand, beginning his longest run in the side since his debut. A shortened run-up was experimented with before being abandoned but his rhythm had been affected and, having played just once in England's Champions Trophy campaign, he was dropped after the first Test of the 2013 Ashes. After his tumultuous winter in 2013/14, he rebuilt his confidence with the aid of Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson and was rewarded with an ODI recall against India in August 2014. For all the problems, further success in the 2015 Ashes series left England still convinced that Finn was a bowler of rare potential."", ""A stress fracture of the foot ruled him out of a series against Pakistan in the UAE but his recovery on a Lions tour of the Emirates was swift and he was called into England's South Africa squad ahead of the first Test."", ""If the collapse of his action in Australia in 2013/14 was a low point, he was successful enough to proclaim in England's 2015 Ashes victory that his problems were behind him, encouraged by a Test-best 6 for 79 at Edgbaston.

Those whose memories go back that far will always feel that his tour of Australia in 1924-25, although England won only one Test, was the moment when we first had cause to hope that the dark days were ending, that soon we would be once more competing with Australia on level terms. In two or three seasons by his insistence on fielding and on attacking cricket and by his own superb example he raised Sussex from being nothing in particular to one of the biggest draws in England. \n', 'For all too short a span, before injury reduced his effectiveness, he was himself an exciting cricketer--the best really fast bowler we had produced for many years--though even then we did not quite put him among the great, a batsman of whom one might say that, however low he went in, no match was irredeemably lost until he was out for the second time, and one of the finest mid-offs anyone could remember.', 'But even at the height of his career his services to cricket did not stop there. Unless he was touring abroad in the winter, he was touring Sussex, speaking at dinners, lecturing and doing all he could to spread the enthusiasm for the game that he himself felt; and this continued for years after his retirement. His first-class career ended in 1932--indeed he played little cricket of any kind afterwards--but he went on working tirelessly for Sussex cricket and, when opportunity offered, for England.', ""He had been Chairman of Sussex and in 1967 was President of the M.C.C. He remained fit and active to the end. Throughout the summer of 1976 he might be found watching at Hove or Lord's or Arundel, as clear in mind and alert as ever, endlessly appreciative of good cricket and showing the utmost kindness and encouragement to the young, but equally uncompromising in his condemnation of anything which savoured of sharp practice or ill temper. In between he was still playing golf regularly at Pulborough, where he had gone round in under his age, and in the winter he was off to follow an England side in Australia or the West Indies, or to ski on the continent."", 'At Dulwich, where he also distinguished himself as a runner and a hurdler, he was four years in the XI and Captain in the last two, 1913 and 1914, in both of which seasons he played for Surrey II in the holidays. The war stopped his cricket till 1919, when he got his blue at Cambridge and in the second innings against Oxford took six for 52. This was widely acclaimed as the best fast bowling seen in the match for many years. For Cambridge against Sussex that year he created some sensation by making 101 going in last; he and J. H. Naumann, who like himself later played for Sussex, put on 177 in sixty-five minutes. However it must be admitted that Sussex had, as not infrequently at this time, a very weak bowling side.', 'Later Gilligan played three matches for Surrey, but in 1920, after again playing for Cambridge, he transferred to Sussex, for whom he continued to play till 1932, captaining them from 1922 to 1929. At first he was only a useful county player, but in 1922 he jumped right to the front, taking 135 wickets with an average of 18.75 and playing for the first time for the Gentlemen. That winter he went with the M.C.C. to South Africa and next summer for the only time did the double.', ""In 1924 he was picked to captain England and in the first Test at Edgbaston he and Tate bowled out South Africa on a good wicket for 30, Gilligan's share being six for 7; in the follow-on he took five for 83. There can be no doubt that just at that period these two were the most formidable combination in the world. A week or two earlier in consecutive matches for Sussex they had bowled out two of the strongest batting sides in England, Surrey for 53 at the Oval and Middlesex for 41 at Lord's, Gilligan on this occasion taking eight for 25. At the end of June that year he had taken seventy-four wickets at fifteen runs each."", 'At the beginning of July, batting for Gentlemen v. Players at The Oval, he was struck over the heart by a rising ball from Pearson of Worcestershire, a medium pace off-spinner and a man universally liked and respected. It was clear that he was badly hurt, but no one guessed how badly. He undoubtedly increased the damage by insisting on going on playing and even more by scoring 112 in the second innings in an hour and a half and adding 134 for the last wicket with Michael Falcon. As he himself wrote some years later, That was probably the worst thing I ever did. He was never able to bowl really fast again and indeed was never more than a change bowler. When he captained England in Australia that winter, his ten wickets in the Test cost him 51.90 runs each and his highest score was 31. Except for his brilliant fielding and inspiring captaincy he was a passenger. In 1926 he was a Selector and the following winter made his last tour abroad, captaining the M.C.C. in India, not then a Test-playing country.', 'At his best, Gilligan was a genuinely fast bowler, who bowled at the stumps or for catches in the slips. His action may have been slightly low, but he was accurate and regarded it as a cardinal sin to bowl short. He was an attacking batsman, who believed especially that fast bowlers needed hitting. His twelve centuries in first-class cricket must have been scored at an average rate of over a run a minute. Nearly all of them he made going in late, when runs were desperately wanted. Moreover, they were usually against strong sides--two against Lancashire, two against Kent, one each against Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Surrey and the Players. At mid-off he has had few rivals.', 'As a captain, he may not have been in the top rank of tacticians, but no one excelled him in getting the best out of his side and inspiring them in the field. From every point of view he was a cricketer with whom England could well do now.', 'After he retired from active cricket he became a popular radio commentator on Test matches and will be especially remembered for his partnership with another much loved cricketer, Victor Richardson. Gilligan was, as may be imagined, a master of the diplomatic comment if any tiresome incident occurred.', ""He was prominent too in the golfing world, being President of the English Golf Union in 1959 and also, up to the time of his death, of the County Cricketers' Golfing Society. His two brothers were only less distinguished as cricketers than himself. F. W., the eldest, who played against him in his two `Varsity matches, captained Oxford and kept wicket for Essex for many years in the holidays, while the youngest, A. H. H., succeeded him as Captain of Sussex and took an M.C.C. side to Australia and New Zealand in 1929; his daughter married Peter May."", 'The three brothers were in the Dulwich XI together in 1913. Well might a newspaper of that day say, The Gilligans of Dulwich seem destined to become as famous in sport as the Fords of Repton, the Lytteltons of Eton and the Fosters of Malvern.

With a high-trotting approach to the crease climaxing in an energetic flurry of limbs, Giles did not have the most fluent spin-bowling action - possibly because he began life as a fast bowler - and was once derided as a ""wheely-bin"", much to his own annoyance. But he was accurate, found some turn and even more bounce, and he established himself as a dependable spinner for England in five seasons at the turn of the century. \n', ""Giles was forced into retirement by injury in 2007 but quickly became a coach, first at Warwickshire and then with the England limited-overs sides. He missed out on becoming England's full-time coach in 2014 and came back to county cricket with Lancashire."", ""Throughout his playing career, Giles had to justify his selection at almost every moment of uncertainty, and in early 2004 he came close to retirement after a modest tour of the Caribbean. Instead, he returned a matchwinning nine-wicket haul at Lord's later that summer, and imbued with new confidence, he continued to chip in with vital performances - with ball and increasingly, with bat - culminating in his career-best 59 at The Oval, an innings which helped seal England's first Ashes victory for 18 years."", ""Until his late flowering, Giles's most memorable moments had all come on his three tours of the subcontinent. The rip-snorting delivery that pitched outside leg and fizzed past Inzamam-ul-Haq's dangling bat on to the stumps at Karachi was the best piece of bowling by an England spinner since Phil Tufnell teased the Aussies at The Oval in 1997, and paved the way for a famous victory. It was on that tour of Pakistan in 2000-01 that Giles became England's No. 1 slow bowler. "", ""The following winter, and nursing a persistent Achilles injury, he hobbled back and forth from the middle to the physio's ice bucket, while returning Test-best figures of 5 for 67 at Ahmedabad. And, two years later, after remodelling his action and enduring a dismal tour to Bangladesh, he burst back to form in Sri Lanka, with 18 wickets in the series and a magnificent match-saving stand in the first Test at Galle. "", ""It was just the latest of many impressive batting performances from a man who had worked hard at his game to become a pivotal player in England's lower order, and against New Zealand at Trent Bridge in 2004 his stand with Graham Thorpe was instrumental in England's triumph. One month later at Lord's, he produced a wickedly ripping delivery to bowl Brian Lara - his 100th wicket in Tests, weeks after being virtually written off by the press. In the field he had a strong arm and was agile for a man of his size, but a persistent hip injury ruled him out of England contention throughout 2006. "", ""Though his skills as a utility player continued to appeal to his coach, Duncan Fletcher, the strides made by his replacement, Monty Panesar, put a return to the fold in jeopardy. Giles kept Panesar out of the team for the first two Tests of the 2006-07 Ashes, but with such a lack of cricket the folly of the selection was soon exposed. He took just two wickets before Panesar returned at Perth with a five-wicket haul. Giles' tour was brought to a premature end when he flew home to be with his ill wife. "", ""Any chance of a return to England colours vanished when a recurrence of his hip problem forced him to announce his retirement towards the end of the 2007 season but within weeks he had been appointed as Warwickshire's director of cricket. Following a shakeup with the England selection panel, he was named a part-time selector alongside James Whitaker, as David Graveney's 11-year reign as chief selector came to an end and, most significantly, in late 2012 was named England's limited-overs coach as Andy Flower's workload was lightened. He led England on a modest World T20 campaign in Bangladesh in 2014 and then missed out the full-time role to Peter Moores."", 'After a brief period out of the game, he was reappointed as director of cricket by Warwickshire at the end of the 2016 season. The club was subsequently relegated in 2017, though the emergence of some young player and some improved form in T20 cricket - Birmingham reached the final of the domestic competition - provided some hope of better times to come.']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1996,1997', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005']",54.0,81,13,1421.0,59,20.89,3064,46.37,0,4,175,5,33.0,0.0,62.0,35,13,385.0,41,17.5,551,69.87,0,0,24,4,22.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,178.0,249,46,5346,128*,26.33,,,3,22,,,80,0,224.0,141,41,2089,107,20.89,,,1,5,,,73,0,2.0,1,1,0,0*,-,1,0.00,0,0,0,0,0,0,54.0,88,12180,5806,143.0,5/57,9/122,40.6,2.86,85.1,11,5,0,62.0,57,2856,2069,55.0,5/57,5/57,37.61,4.34,51.9,0,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,178.0,,37304,15958,539,8/90,,29.60,2.56,69.2,,26,3,224.0,,9729,6961,272,5/21,5/21,25.59,4.29,35.7,5,3,0,2.0,2,42,34,2,2/21,2/21,17.00,4.85,21.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Hammond was the undisputed successor to Jack Hobbs as England's premier

team during the Bradman era. 
 ","['\nThe judgment of cricket history is that the greatest batsmen the game has known are - in order of appearance, only - WG Grace, Jack Hobbs, Walter Hammond and Don Bradman. Others may come close indeed to those four but do not quite take place with them. It is, of course, coincidence that two of them played for Gloucestershire; but without doubt Hammond, although he was not a native of that county, succeeded by right and without question to the eminence there previously occupied solely by Dr Grace. \n', 'Wally Hammond was a most exciting cricketer, perhaps the more so for the hint of an almost Olympian aloofness. He was also - and the two do not always go together - a naturally-gifted athlete who could excel at any game he cared to play; today he would be brought up as a rising football star. He had that physical stamp; he moved easily, with an ease which yet promised that, at need, he could launch himself into a tiger leap. Even as late as 1951, when he made his last first-class appearance and after he had put on a considerable amount of weight, his movement was poised, assured, and graceful.', 'The instant he walked out of a pavilion, white-spotted blue handkerchief showing from his right pocket, bat tucked underarm, cap at a hint of an angle, he was identifiable as a thoroughbred. Strongly-built, square-shouldered, deep-chested, with impressively powerful forearms, it seemed as if his bat weighed nothing in those purposeful hands.', 'His figures are convincing evidence of his quality. Between 1920 and 1951 he scored 50,493 runs, with 167 centuries and an average of 56.10; in Tests 7249 runs (22 centuries) at 58.45, as a bowler, 732 wickets (average 30.58); and he held 820 catches. Like Jack Hobbs, he might have achieved even more impressive figures if he had been able to play throughout his career. For instance, he first appeared for Gloucestershire (where he had been to school at Cirencester for five years) in 1920; but Lord Harris, piqued that he would not play for Kent, the county of his birth, quibbled about his qualification. So, effectively, he did not enter county cricket until 1923; he missed the entire season of 1926 through an illness contracted in the West Indies (he came back to start the next season by scoring 1000 in May); of course, he lost the 1940 to 1945 seasons when he was on a high plateau of achievement; and played only two first class matches after he returned from  Australia in March 1947.', 'A natural player, he was virtually never coached until he had become a county player, when George Dennett used sometimes to advise him. Instinctively basically correct, he was sound in defence, but never defensively-minded. Like most outstanding batsmen, he was primarily a front-foot player who, with the years, operated more off the back. His great power lay in his driving, which was pure textbook in style, clean, apparently effortless but, through the combination of innate timing and immense strength, often achieving immense velocity.', 'As a young man he was a dashing strokemaker; willing to tilt at all the bowlers of the world. He remained superbly stylish, his cover-driving, from front foot or back, utterly memorable. In those early days he cut, glanced, hooked and lofted the ball quite fearlessly. With his early maturity, he became a thinking batsmen. When he went to Australia under Percy Chapman in  1928-29, although he was only 25 he had worked out exactly how he would make his runs. Eschewing the hook altogether and, largely, the cut, he decided to score - off all but the obviously punishable ball - within the V between extra cover and midwicket. He succeeded with a new record aggregate for a rubber of 905 runs at 113.12 in the five Tests; which has still only once been exceeded (by Sir Donald Bradman, of course).', 'Even in his cricketing middle age, his footwork flowed like that of a young man. He would be down the pitch - two, three or four yards - with unhurried ease and, as he reached the length he wanted, the bat moved with languid certainty through the ball, which flew, with that savage force which was the measure of his hitting, to the place he wished.', 'Of the four great batsmen he was physically the finest and most powerfully equipped. He was a superb fast-medium bowler who often, as Sir Donald Bradman once remarked, ""was too busy scoring runs to worry about bowling."" When he was roused - as he once was by Essex bowling bouncers at the  Gloucestershire batsmen - his pace could be devastating. ""I never saw a man bowl faster for Gloucestershire than Wally did that day,"" said Tom Goddard, ""and he not only battered them, he bowled them out as well.""', 'At slip he had no superior. He stood all but motionless, moved late but with uncanny speed, never needing to stretch or strain but plucking the ball from the air like an apple from a tree.', 'Statistics cannot tell all: but revealingly they show of Wally Hammond that he made 167 centuries and reached fifty without making a hundred 184 times, in Tests 22 hundreds, only 24 fifties without reaching three figures; in each case almost even money on 100 if he got halfway.', 'He became an amateur in 1938, and captained  England as well as both Gentlemen and Players. It is some measure of his quality that in 1946, at 43, he was top of the first-class averages with 1783 runs at 84.90 - 16 ahead of the next man. He had a sad tour as captain of  England in Australia 1946-47. He was miserably afflicted with arthritis, had acute personal problems, could make runs in State matches but not in Tests, England were roundly beaten and, on his return to England, he announced his retirement. He mistakenly allowed himself to be persuaded to appear in one match in each of the 1950 and  1951 seasons. A quiet - some thought introverted - man, but a loyal friend, he retired, hard-up and unhappy, to South Africa. There he died in 1965, mourned by more admirers than he may have guessed.

August 22, 1892, Balham, London ","June 15, 1985, Exeter, Devon (aged 92 years 297 days) ",,"['England,', 'Surrey,', 'Sussex']",St Paul's School,,,,Right-hand bat,"Right-arm medium, Legbreak",,Uncle - ,,"['\nPercy Fender was the last survivor of those who had played county cricket regularly before the Great War: more important, he was one of the most colourful figures in the cricket world for many years after it and was widely regarded as the shrewdest county captain of his generation. In a career of 26 years he scored 19,034 runs with an average of 26.66, took 1,894 wickets at 25.05, made 21 hundreds and caught 599 catches. Six times he did the double. But he was not a cricketer who could be judged on figures. Wisden has never been a slave to statistics and, when in 1915 he appeared as one of the Five Cricketers of the Year, it was after a season in which both his bowling and batting averages had been approximately 23 and he had not scored 1,000 runs nor taken 100 wickets. Yet the honour was fully deserved. Surrey had won the Championship and Tom Hayward had said that Fender was the making of their XI. In a crucial match, for instance, against Kent, the reigning champions, at Lord\'s in August (The Oval was occupied by the military), going in on a pitch made for Blythe, who took nine for 97. with a scoreboard reading 147 for four, he made 48 in twenty minutes, thus securing Surrey a lead of 94: he also took in the match five for 43 and thus played a big part in his side\'s victory. But besides his batting and bowling, Surrey that year owed much to his superb slip fielding. Their bowling, not strong for a champion county, depended largely on Hitch, who was fast, and Rushby, who was fast-medium, and on the perfect Oval pitches a dropped slip catch could easily mean a lost match. \nThroughout his career Fender\'s policy was to hit fiercely, regardless of the state of the pitch, even of the quality of the bowling. He was a tremendous driver and also delighted in the pull, and he cut or slashed ferociously outside the off stump: he once slashed the ball over cover out of The Oval. It was difficult to set a field for him. His century in 35 minutes against Northamptonshire in 1920 remains a record, though it was equalled in farcical circumstances in 1983. His highest score, 185 against Hampshire in 1922, took 130 minutes and against Kent later that season he made 137 in an hour and a half, 52 of them off fourteen consecutive balls. It was not to be expected that one batting on these principles would be as consistent as a more sedate player, but in the very strong Surrey batting sides of those days another solid bat would have been neither here nor there: Fender the hitter was invaluable. \nHis attitude to bowling was the same. His object was to get the batsman out, and the tactics fostered by the modern one-day game would never have suited him. He had at his command a great variety of pace, spin and swing and all were fully employed. Inevitably his length sometimes suffered. Yet it was unwise to assume that because a batsman was out to a full toss it was a lucky wicket almost as likely as not it was bowled for that very purpose. Probably he was least expensive when he concentrated on leg-breaks and googlies. Whatever he was bowling he had a wonderfully sharp eye for a batsman\'s weak points. There can be no doubt that his best role was as the fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side. Unluckily this was a part he was seldom able to play, and for much of his time in the Surrey team he had to do the work of a stock bowler. As such he did wonders, but to borrow a phrase used by W .G. in a different context, he ""never hadn\'t ought to have been put to it"". His most spectacular bowling performance was against Middlesex at Lord\'s in 1927, when his analysis read 5.3-2-10-7; eleven balls produced six wickets for 1 run.  \n', ""Born at Balham, he was educated at St George's, Weybridge, and St Paul's, where he was three years in the XI, heading the batting averages in each of them and in the second representing the Public Schools at Lord's. His family was living in Sussex and it was for them that he first appeared in county cricket in 1910, his last year at school, but neither then nor in 1911 did he do much. It was a brilliant 133 not out against Oxford University at Horsham in 1912 that showed his possibilities and won him a prolonged trial. In 1913 he got his 1,000 runs and was picked for the Gentlemen at both Lord's and The Oval, but the next year he switched his allegiance to Surrey, for whom he continued to appear until 1935. In 1919, having served in the Royal Flying Corps during the war, he was kept out of cricket by a broken leg, but in 1920 he did well enough to gain a place in the M.C.C. team to Australia. There he headed the bowling averages for the Tests and twice in the course of them took five wickets in an innings, but the Australians did not think he had enough spin to be formidable on their pitches. In fact he proved only marginally a Test match player and this may have saved the selectors, who were thought never to favour him as a captain of England, an embarrassing problem. In only one series, in South Africa in 1922-23, did he keep his place throughout and South African cricket was then at a low ebb. In thirteen appearances for England between 1920 and 1929 he made 380 runs with an average of 19 and took 29 wickets at 40.86. Meanwhile in 1921 he had succeeded C. T. A. Wilkinson as captain of Surrey, a position which he held until he handed over to D. R. Jardine after 1931, and it was generally recognised that it was his captaincy more than anything else that kept a side so deficient in bowling so high in the table: twice they were second and only in his last three seasons did they fall below fifth. "", 'After his retirement he continued for many years to play in less important cricket and many young players can testify to the encouragement he gave them and how much they were helped by his advice. He was a very kind man and would have been an excellent coach. He also made a considerable contribution to cricket literature, including four books on Test series, 1920-21, 1928-29, 1930 and 1934, which are among the best of their kind. An ABC of Cricket contains a fascinating account of his progress from prep school to county cricket, besides some admirable technical advice. At the same time his outspoken articles in newspapers did not always endear him to the authorities.

July 9, 1893, Barwell, Leicestershire ","March 6, 1981, Leicester (aged 87 years 240 days) ",,"['England,', 'Leicestershire']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm fast-medium,Coach,,,"['\nGeorge Geary, who died at the age of 87 on March 6, 1981, after a long period of ill-health, had been in his day one of the best bowlers in the world and was also one of the last survivors of those who were playing regular county cricket before the Great War. A tall, powerful man, he bowled fast-medium well within his strength, with a short run and a beautifully easy action. His stock ball moved naturally form the off and could be deadly if the wicket helped him, as when he ruined his second benefit, against Warwickshire at Hinckley in 1936, by taking thirteen for 43 (the match produced him £10). This was varied by a delivery which came straight through and, a far more dangerous ball, the leg-cutter which pitched on middle-and-leg and left the bat sharply. This was the one which the experts dreaded and which secured the all-important wicket of Bradman, caught at slip for 29, in the Nottingham Test of 1934. Apart from this he could make full use of the shine to swing the new ball. Yet with all these gifts, he will probably be remembered chiefly as a stock bowler who would peg away cheerfully all day if need be, keeping the situation under control whether or not he was getting wickets. As a batsman he never claimed to be a stylist, but he was typically effective: the more runs were needed, the more resolutely he would set himself to get them, not least by punishing ruthlessly anything which fell short of his very high standards of what first-class bowling should be. In his last season, at the age of 45, when an injury prevented him from doing his full share of bowling, he scored three centuries. He was a fine slip, but in fact his vast hands were equally tenacious anywhere: in The Oval Test of 1926, besides two blinding slip catches off Larwood, he caught a brilliant one low at mid-off off Rhodes to dismiss Arthur Richardson. \n', ""Making a few appearances for Leicestershire in 1912, he gained a regular place in 1913, and in 1914, when he took over 100 wickets, he was picked for his first representative match, the Centenary at Lord's, the Rest of England against MCC's South African team. This should have given him his one chance of seeing the great Sydney Barnes bowl, but, when he arrived in the dressing-room, he found Barnes urging the others not to play unless they received more money. "", "" says Barnes was prevented from playing by a strain. At this point Geary's career suffered a serious setback. Serving in the Air Force in the Great War, he was lucky not to have his leg severed by a propeller; but the damage was such that, after an unsuccessful season in 1919, he decided that he was not for the moment strong enough for county cricket and went into the Lancashire League. It was not till 1922 that he resumed a regular place in the Leicestershire side."", ""In 1923 he appeared in a Test trial and in 1924-25 made his first tour abroad, for Lord Tennyson's unofficial side in South Africa, where he was an outstanding success as a bowler. In 1924 he had been picked for his First Test, against South Africa, and in 1926 he played against Australia at Leeds, where Carr put his opponents in with disastrous results. According to Geary his captain's great mistake was taking his batsmen, not his bowlers, out to inspect the wicket. At any rate, when Geary came in the score, in face of a total of 494, was 182 for eight. He and MacAulay added 108, Geary making 35 not out, and, though he could not save the follow-on, he may well have rescued England from defeat. He played again in the final Test at The Oval. That winter he went with MCC to India and in 1927-28 was a member of their side in South Africa, where he took twelve for 130 in the first Test and was reckoned by the South Africans to be, on a matting wicket, the finest bowler of his type since Barnes. Unfortunately, in the Second Test his right arm, which had troubled him intermittently for some years, became so bad that he could not play again until the last match, and further he missed most of the 1928 season. Indeed his career was in jeopardy. He was saved by Lord Harris, who enquired into his case and insisted upon his having the best medical treatment. An operation was performed on his elbow and was so successful that he was not only able to accept an invitation to go to Australia in 1928-29, but, with nineteen wickets at an average of 25, headed the bowling averages in the Tests. At Sydney in the Second Test he followed five for 35 with an innings of 66, and in the final Test at Melbourne he had in the first innings the astonishing analysis of 81-36-105-5. In 1929 he played in the last two Tests against South Africa; in 1930 he played against Australia at Leeds, and in 1934, also against Australia, at Nottingham and Lord's. At Nottingham, coming in at 165 for six, he scored 53, including ten 4s, and helped Hendren to put on 101 in 110 minutes. In 1932 he had gone withLord Tennyson's team to the West Indies and, as he also once took a coaching appointment in South America, he was one of the most widely travelled cricketers of his time."", 'His last season for Leicestershire was 1938 and then he became the professional at Charterhouse. He showed himself a great coach and in particular was one of the few who could really teach bowling. Feeling that at 65 he would be rash to undertake another three-year contract, he left Charterhouse in 1959 with great reluctance on both sides, but Rugby were desperate for help and persuaded him to come and stand behind their nets. Before the end of the first net he could bear it no longer, had his coat off and continued to bowl for another eleven years.', 'Few professionals have been more popular and more respected, and deservedly. No-one ever saw him out of temper: he was always cheerful and smiling and had a wonderful sense of humour which made him a splendid raconteur. E. W. Dawson said that, when he took over the Leicestershire captaincy immediately after coming down from Cambridge and utterly inexperienced, he owed everything to Geary, who, though not yet the senior professional, looked after him like a father.', 'In all first-class matches he made 13,500 runs (including eight centuries) with an average of 19.80 and took 2,063 wickets at 20.03.', ': George really fired me with the enthusiasm and ambition to play first-class cricket and to get to the top. When he told me of his great experiences in Australia and India and the wonderful friends he had made, I knew that this was something which I really wanted to follow. You will be judged by your scores. Never give your wicket away. I shall always have the happiest memories of this great man.\n', ""\nThe death of George Geary on March 6, at the age of 87, leaves Harold Larwood the sole survivor from England's victorious XI at The Oval against Australia in 1926. In that famous match, Geary took two stinging catches (Woodfull and Macartney) at slip off Larwood, had the honour of bowling last man Mailey to win the Ashes, and had all his money stolen from his hotel bedroom on the last morning. Earlier in the series, at Headingley, he played an important part in keeping England's hopes alive by helping Macaulay put on 108 for the ninth wicket and saving the follow-on."", 'He was a loyal, hard-working and gifted professional, with a buoyant humour\nso necessary for a stock bowler, especially when he has to get through 81 overs in an innings, as Geary did at Melbourne in 1929, taking 5 for 105.', 'I went to see him in his tidy little home in 1973, and the reminiscences poured forth in rich profusion but with modesty. I lost track of him, but last year saw him in a nursing home. He now looked his great age, and his memory had gone almost completely.', 'He was Leicestershire through and through, the eldest of sixteen children of a\nshoemaker in the village of Barwell. The first county match he saw was the first he played in, in 1912. By the time his service to Leicestershire drew to a close in 1938, he had taken 2063 wickets in first-class cricket at 20.04 and scored 13,504 runs at 19.80, with eight centuries. He also held 451 catches.', 'After coming close to emigrating to Canada, he almost had his cricket career\naborted in 1914 when 21-year-old Aircraftman Geary had his left shoulder\nand thigh slashed by a spinning propeller. He was still suffering severe after-effects in 1919. He played for Nelson in the league in 1920, and then Leicestershire called him back.', ""With the talented Ewart Astill as co-driver, Geary steered the county's fortunes\nfor the best part of 20 years, carrying the attack both with the new ball and, with his notable stamina, often down the innings. Tall, he had a lively, rhythmic action (I happened, by the oddest chance, to have watched him in action on film only a week before the announcement of his death: a 1926 clip turned up during a session of Wisden Film Search). Like S. F. Barnes, he biassed the ball cleverly and sharply, his leg-cutter being deadly. The outstanding performances began to accumulate."", ""His best figures came at Pontypridd in 1929: 10 for 18 against Glamorgan, a world record until Verity took 10 for 10. In 1926 he blazed to 39 wickets in eight innings in June, taking 14 in one match at Southampton and 14 in another at Ashby de la Zouch. His batting often came in useful too, although he tended to shrug it off as a casual accessory to his chief role. Some large scores stand to his credit, including a century for Players v Gentlemen, but he found significance in valuable small knocks, like the nine runs he made off 101\nballs in the Adelaide Test of 1928-29, and the four he hit to win the previous Test ('I got £10 for that bat - the bat that won the Ashes!'). That tour began for George Geary with a smashed nose in Perth. He was carried off on a door, no stretcher being available. Yet he was to carry a large burden of responsibility during Chapman's triumphant tour, topping the Test bowling despite missing the opening Test, won by England by an innings and 675 runs on a pitch on which he might easily have taken a dozen wickets."", ""He played against Australia in 1930 (once) and 1934 (twice), finishing his Test\ndays in 'Verity's match', his only appearance for England at Lord's, when he\nwas almost 41. A fortnight earlier he had saved a little face for England with a\nseventh-wicket stand of 101 at Trent Bridge with Hendren. 'I could see O'Reilly set his teeth,' he recalled. 'It made me set mine.'"", ""Geary's best Test figures came at Johannesburg in the first Test of the 1927-28\nseries. His 7 for 70 and 5 for 60 on the matting promised to be a curtain-up for a repeat of Barnes's sensational feats of 1913-14. But elbow trouble in the second Test forced him out of the series and probably dashed what would have been an English victory."", ""There have been some catastrophic benefits, but Geary's second, in 1936, ranks\namong the unhappiest, even if it was partly his own doing. At Hinckley, he took 7 for 7 and 6 for 20 against Warwickshire and finished with the princely sum of £10. After retirement came two decades of coaching at Charterhouse, where he schooled the budding genius of Peter May, and one at Rugby."", 'He was the last of the pre-1914 Leicestershire cricketers, a yeoman of the\ngame, and yet perhaps a player whose name means less in later years than is\ndeserving.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1927'],14.0,20,4,249.0,66,15.56,,,0,2,,0,13.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,549.0,820,138,13501,122,19.79,,,8,54,,,450,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14.0,22,3810,1353,46.0,7/70,12/130,29.41,2.13,82.8,0,4,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,549.0,,116292,41336,2063,10/18,,20.03,2.13,56.3,,125,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

6 ft 4 in ",,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm fast,,,,"['\nKen Farnes, the  Cambridge,  Essex and  England fast bowler, was killed during the night of October 20, when the plane in which he was pilot crashed. His death at the age of 30 came as a great shock to countless friends and the whole world of cricket.After training in Canada he desired to become a night-flying pilot, and within four weeks of his return to England he met his disastrous end. \n', ""Discovered when 19 years of age by Mr. Percy Perrin in an Essex Club and Ground match against Gidea Park in 1930,  Kenneth Farnes took five  Kent wickets for 36 runs in his second county match and was welcome in the  Essex team whenever available. After three years in the  Cambridge Eleven, he went as a master to Worksop College, and consequently his appearances in first-class cricket were limited. His University experiences brought continuous improvement. In  1933 his work for  Cambridge showed 41 wickets at 17.39 runs apiece, and he was by far the most effective amateur bowler in the country with a record of 113 wickets at 18.38 each. In a drawn match with  Oxford seven wickets fell to him at a cost of 71 runs. His best performance that season--11 wickets for 114 runs, 7 for 21 in the  second innings--enabled  Essex to beat  Surrey by 345 runs at Southend, their first success against these opponents since  1914. In ten matches for the County,  Farnes claimed 67 wickets at an average cost of 16.07, and this form  brought him the honour of representing  England in the  first Test against  Australia in  1934. Despite his fine performance -- ten wickets for 179 runs -- England lost by 238 runs. Strangely enough, when  England won by an innings and 38 runs at  Lord's,  Farnes did not meet with any reward, Verity taking the honours.  Farnes was not called upon again in that series, but in  1938 he took most wickets in Tests against  Australia -- 17 at 34.17 each."", ""In  1934 he was largely responsible for the first victory of  Essex over  Yorkshire since  1911 by taking 11 wickets for 131, Southend again proving a favourable ground for him. Thanks to  Farnes dismissing seven men for 59 in the final stage,  Essex brought about a great triumph by an innings and 46 runs. After a tour in West Indies knee trouble prevented  Farnes from playing in  1935, but next season, for the  Gentlemen at  Lord's, he created a sensation by bowling Gimblett, Hammond and Hardstaff in quick succession, a stump being sent flying in each case. With four men out for 33, the  Players were in danger of defeat, but, after the complete loss of Wednesday owing to rain, there was not time to reach a finish in two days. This fine work influenced the choice of  Farnes to tour Australia with the team captained by G. O. Allen in the winter of  1936. Never did he bowl better than in the last Test, when he took six wickets for 96 runs in a total of 604;  Australia won by an innings and 200 -- a result that decided the rubber."", "" Farnes bowled well in Test trials at  Lord's. In  1938 he gave special proof of being in great form by dismissing eight  Players for 43 runs in the  first innings and three in the second for 60, so doing a lot towards the  Gentlemen winning by 133 runs--their second victory in this encounter since the last war. In the following winter he went with the England touring team to South Africa, where he was second in Test bowling to Verity. His 16 wickets cost 32.43 each, while in the whole tour 44 wickets fell to him at 27.43 a piece. He did the best bowling of the  third Test, the only one brought to a definite finish, which gave W. R. Hammond's side the rubber. With four wickets for 29,  Farnes was mainly instrumental in making  South Africa follow on, and he dismissed three men for 80 in their  second innings of 353, which left  England still 13 runs to the good after a declaration with only four men out. Paynter, 243 -- a South African record -- and Hammond, 120, were the great batsmen on that occasion; their stand realised 242."", "" Farnes made his first appearance of the season in  1939 for the  Gentlemen, and showed his fondness for  Lord's by disposing of the last three  Players in the course of six balls. This final effort by  Farnes at headquarters recalls how well he bowled in University matches; but in  1932 he disfigured an analysis of five wickets for 98 runs by being  called 21 times. The discipline then brought to bear was effective in correcting a faulty approach to the crease. Nearly six feet five inches tall,  Farnes, taking a comparatively short and easy run, brought the ball down from a great height with the inevitable effect of sharp lift, which made him extremely difficult to time when retaining a good length. Altogether in first-class cricket  Farnes took 720 wickets at an average of 20.55 each."", 'A very good fielder near the wicket,  Farnes reached many catches that would have been impossible for a man of medium height. He had no pretension as a batsman, but in  1936, at Taunton, hit up 97 not out in two hours, Wade helping to add 149 for the last wicket; dismissing six men in the match,  Farnes was largely responsible for  Essex winning by an innings and 66 runs.

He was also Jack Hobbs's opening partner in Hobbs's first Test, at Melbourne in 1907-08. In that match, Fane top-scored in the second innings as England squeaked home by one wicket. Fane also represented Essex with distinction for 20 years, and scored close to 20,000 first-class runs.

Educated at Charterhouse, Frederick Fane was in the X1 from 1892 to 1894, and after coming down from Oxford, where he gained a Blue in 1897 and the following year, he played a good deal for Essex, being captain from 1904 to 1906. His best season for the county was that of 1906 when he scored 1,572 runs, average 34. In 1899 he put together his highest innings, 207 against Leicestershire.

If English cricket was still not debating the enforced removal of Kevin Pietersen from international cricket, it was arguing over the conservative approach towards one-day batting at the top of the order. Hales, a tall batsman with a destructive range of offside drives and cuts, was one of a brazen new breed of England batsmen who changed the conversation into something much more positive. \n', 'It took 32 international Twenty20 appearances - strikingly good figures, too, with an average of 38 and a strike rate approaching 140 - before Hales finally won ODI recognition from England selectors who mistrusted his technique against the short ball and his ability to build an innings. ', ""There followed a comparable wait before England considered a further transition - from ODI batsman to Test opener. His 24 ODIs had brought modest success - his average in the mid-20s - but a timely maiden ODI hundred against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi helped to propel him into England's Test squad for their 2015/16 tour of South Africa as he became the eighth opener to try to fill the gap left by Andrew Strauss' Test retirement more than three years earlier. England had exhibited a wish to play a more expansive game at Test level and that worked in his favour."", ""Eleven Tests from the Boxing Day meeting with South Africa in Durban in 2015 until The Oval brought down the curtain on the 2016 English summer against Pakistan represented a decent run in which to establish himself, but he did not take easily to the tempo and technique at Test level. In three successive Tests against Sri Lanka - at Headingley, Chester-le-Street and Lord's - he passed 80 without securing the maiden Test century he craved and which might have been a harbinger for better things. When he chose, along with his limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan, not to tour Bangladesh for safety reasons (the tour passed off uneventfully amid high security) he also found himself omitted from the subsequent India tour because of his doubts about his capacity against spin bowling. "", ""In one-day cricket, though, his prowess was evident. When he lashed 171 during the third ODI against Pakistan on his home soil at Trent Bridge in 2016, he broke the England record previously held by Robin Smith for 23 years. Hales' innings also helped England achieve the highest ever team ODI score in the same game - 444-3, bettering the previous record of 443 by Sri Lanka back in 2006."", 'Off the field, he was present with Ben Stokes when Stokes was charged of affray (for which he was found not guilty) outside a Bristol night club in September 2017; Hales was not charged.', 'Early in February 2018, Hales committed himself solely to limited-overs cricket by signing a white-ball only contract with Nottinghamshire and playing IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad. He had averaged 27.28 in his 11 Tests, and prospects of further opportunities were minimal, although he did signal his intention to reconsider his future after the 2019 World Cup. His ODI form remained occasionally devastating and he struck 147 during that rarest of things - a whitewash in a one-day series against Australia', 'At 6 foot 5, Hales has always hit with a stately intent. His England T20 debut came in 2011, to which he responded after a debut duck against India by scoring an unbeaten 62 off 48 balls as England beat West Indies at the Oval. In his first Twenty20 international of 2012, against West Indies again, he failed by one run to become the first batsman to score a century for England in the short format on his home ground of Trent Bridge, in June. He promised much in a largely ill-starred England campaign in the 2012 World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, although his innings tended to run out of steam. That first hundred by an England batsman finally came in the 2013 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh when he made an unbeaten 116 from 64 balls against Sri Lanka in Chittagong, striking a six over midwicket to secure a last-over victory. ', 'His reputation in T20 cricket grew and he earned a late deal with Melbourne Renegades for two matches of the 2012/13 Big Bash. His debut brought a brutal 89 in just 52 balls at the SCG.', 'In four-day cricket he initially progressed well, earning his county cap after scoring 184 against Somerset at Trent Bridge on his way to topping 1,000 first-class runs in the season for the first time, despite missing almost seven weeks of the campaign with a broken jaw. He added 857 first-class runs in 2012, including two centuries in August.', 'But there followed a disastrous 2013 Championship season in which Hales virtually lost interest and averaged 13.94, being advised by England as a result that he was in danger of becoming a two-dimensional Twenty20 specialist. He decided to work harder on his four-day cricket - although only after he was overlooked in the IPL 2014 draft. English players were often passed over, with their availability so uncertain, but this omission was more curious than many: his reputation had not spread outside England. No matter, he settled into Championship cricket with 954 runs at 50, perhaps his finest Championship season.', ""He had been part of England's ODI squad to the West Indies but missed out on a debut through injury. Finally, three one-day hundreds in as many weeks for Nottinghamshire, including a 96-ball 141 against Middlesex, added to the clamour for his selection. The time was finally ripe."", 'Sporting talent is in his genes, as his grandfather once took Rod Laver to five sets at Wimbledon. \n', '\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2008, 2009,2010,2011']",11.0,21,0,573.0,94,27.28,1307,43.84,0,5,77,3,8.0,0.0,70.0,67,3,2419.0,171,37.79,2527,95.72,6,14,276,50,27.0,0.0,60.0,60,7,1644.0,116*,31.01,1203,136.65,1,8,175,55,32.0,0.0,107.0,182,6,6655,236,37.81,11268,59.06,13,38,970,38,84,0,172.0,167,6,6170,187*,38.32,6223,99.14,17,31,701,128,63,0,204.0,203,13,5559,116*,29.25,3890,142.90,3,34,622,199,95,0,11.0,1,18,2,0.0,-,-,35.33,0.66,-,0,0,0,70.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,60.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,107.0,8,311,173,3,2/63,2/63,57.66,3.33,103.6,0,0,0,172.0,2,4,10,0,-,-,-,15.00,-,0,0,0,204.0,2,3,7,0,-,-,-,14.00,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He varied his pace well, and his yorker was devastating but sparingly used. He formed a lethal partnership with George Hirst and Wilfred Rhodes which won Yorkshire four Championships in five seasons (1989-1902) and eight throughout his career.  Although his batting was not rated, he was good enough to score a hundred before lunch against Nottinghamshire in 1901. In 1904 he scored 1000 runs, completing the double, and passed 100 wickets in eight other seasons.  He made his Test debut in South Africa in 1898-99 as part of Lord Hawke\'s side, bowling unchanged in the second innings of the second Test at Cape Town to take 6 for 11 as South Africa were bowled out for 35 in 114 balls.  He did not play again until two Tests against Australia in 1905, and that was followed by another tour of South Africa in 1905-06.  He played against Australia once in 1909 and 1912.  Well-liked by colleagues - he was dubbed ""the sunshine of the Yorkshire XI"" - he coached at Winchester for seven years until his premature death in 1921.\n', ' \n', ""He had been in failing health for some time, but to the great body of cricketers the news of his premature death came as quite a shock. After retiring from first-class cricket he took up an appointment as coach at Winchester, and seemed to have a very pleasant time before him. A thorough sportsman, who obviously loved the game, Haigh will live in cricket history as one of the most valued members of Lord Hawke's famous Yorkshire eleven. In two of the three years--1900-02-in which Yorkshire carried off the Championship and put up such wonderful records, he was at his very best. In 1900 he divided the bowling honours with Rhodes, taking in county championship matches 145 wickets for little more than 14 runs apiece, and after a set-back in 1901 he was again at the top of his form in 1902, taking 123 wickets in purely county fixtures, and beating Rhodes in the averages. It was in 1901, when Haigh proved comparatively ineffective, that George Hirst discovered his swerve, and became the deadliest bowler of the season."", ""Haigh began to play cricket as a schoolboy, and when 18 joined the club at Armitage Bridge. Before long he came under the notice of Louis Hall, who at that time was in the habit at the close of each season of taking teams up to Scotland. On Hall's recommendation Haigh was engaged by the Aberdeen club, and after three years with that body he went to Perth. A little later came the turning-point of his career. He met with great success for a Scotch team against Lancashire, and the Yorkshire authorities realised that he might be a first-rate county bowler. He settled down at Leeds, and after a brilliant trial against Durham at Barnsley in 1896 he was given his first opportunity in big cricket, playing for Yorkshire against Australia at Bradford. Yorkshire lost the match by 140 runs, but in the Australians' second innings Haigh took eight wickets--five of them bowled down--and his position was established. Thenceforward till his career ended Haigh, as everyone knows, was one of Yorkshire's mainstays. A right-handed bowler, medium pace to fast, he had a good variety of speed in combination with an off-break that on sticky wickets often made him practically unplayable."", ""In his early days he took a great deal out of himself, finishing his delivery with a tremendous plunge, but as time went on he modified his style and economised his strength. When the conditions helped him he was beyond question one of the most difficult bowlers of his generation, but on hard, true wickets he did not rank with Hirst and Rhodes. He was first and last a county cricketer, all his best work being done for Yorkshire. He played four times for England against Australia--at Lord's and Leeds in 1905, at Lord's in 1909, and at Manchester in 1912--but these matches did not add to his reputation. Indeed, at Lord's in 1905, he proved ineffective on a wicket that was expected to suit him to a nicety. Apart from his special gifts as a bowler Haigh was a thorough cricketer--keen to a degree in the field and quite capable of making runs when they were wanted. If he had been less of a bowler he might easily have made a name for batting. In a memorable match against Surrey at Bradford in 1898 he went in tenth and scored 83, he and Hirst putting on 155 runs together. Haigh retired from the Yorkshire XI after the season of 1913. \n""]","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1901', '""There is no nicer professional cricketer."" - Pelham Warner']",11.0,18,3,113.0,25,7.53,,,0,0,,0,8.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,561.0,747,119,11713,159,18.65,,,4,47,,,299,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,16,1294,622,24.0,6/11,9/99,25.91,2.88,53.9,1,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,561.0,,78817,32091,2012,9/25,,15.94,2.44,39.1,,135,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He cut a similar figure to Alec Stewart with his no-nonsense positivity, even if he did not quite possess the same fastidious attention towards his appearance. \n', ""Prior's reputation reached its peak after England's tour of New Zealand in 2013. He saved the final Test in Auckland, and the series, with a defiant, out-of-character century - batting for four-and-a-half hours for an unbeaten 110, an innings which epitomised England's spirit. He won England's Player of the Year award and his ability to rouse the mood with Churchillian speeches led him to be named as vice captain for the Ashes tour to Australia in 2013-14. But back-to-back Ashes tours treated him unkindly, bringing a marked slump in his form and his keeping standards and he made only one fifty in eight Tests; even that, a counterattacking affair in Perth with the game lost, had an air of desperation. He was dropped for Jonny Bairstow for the final two Tests in Australia and, although he still possessed a Test average above 40, began the 2014 county season with Sussex with his Test spot seriously in question."", ""He was patched up for the first four Tests of the summer - two against Sri Lanka and two against India - but his long-standing Achilles problems severely hampered his wicketkeeping and a subsequent operation revealed such damage that it was amazing he had even taken the field. The last thing he needed was for his commitment to the cause to be demeaned so savagely at the end of the season in Kevin Pietersen's autobiography. He admitted that he was not entirely sure his first-class career could be salvaged and, with an eye to the future, committed his energies to forming a cycling team. With hindsight, it proved a shrewd move and he announced his injury-induced retirement in June 2015."", ""Prior moved to England from South Africa and represented England at all ages, up to and including Under-19s, making his Sussex debut in 2001 as a 19-year-old. He was selected to tour Zimbabwe as part of England's one-day squad in November 2004 and played in just one match, striking 35. He made England's winter squads for Pakistan and India in 2005-06, but played mostly as a batsman in the ODIs and failed to make any real impact. He missed out on the Champions Trophy in October 2006 but was named in the Academy squad to be stationed in Perth during the 2006-07 Ashes series. "", ""Geraint Jones and Chris Read flunked their chances during England's shambolic Ashes campaign, which meant Prior was ready to step into the Test side and launch Peter Moores' period at the helm. He began in thrilling fashion, becoming the first England wicketkeeper to score a century on debut with an unbeaten 126 at Lord's, followed by 75 at Headingley, and England's wicketkeeper problem looked settled. But no sooner was the position sorted than things started going awry. He struggled against India and was a key protagonist in the jellybean fiasco that goaded Zaheer Khan to bowl out England at Trent Bridge before a grim tour to Sri Lanka exposed deep flaws in his keeping. Some misplaced levels of sledging also did not endear him to everybody and he was dropped for England's tour of New Zealand in 2008, with his old Sussex rival, Tim Ambrose - now at Warwickshire - taking the gloves. "", ""But Prior's extra batting class could not be ignored for long, and he returned to the side before the year was out, with his keeping vastly improved during his spell on the outside. He was one of the unsung heroes of England's Ashes triumph in 2009, providing momentum-shifting cameos at No. 6 in the order, and pulling off a series of impressive catches and stumpings. He bettered that effort on the subsequent tour of Australia in 2010-11, claiming 23 catches in the series including an Ashes-record-equalling six in the first innings at Melbourne, and concluded the series with his first hundred against Australia, at Sydney. He made 271 runs at 67.75 during England's 4-0 home triumph against India the following summer as both he and England, who went to No. 1 in the Test rankings, reached a career high.  Fielders standing around point were likely to be under assault if a bowler gave him any width outside off stump. At that juncture he was among several contenders as the most effective wicketkeeper-batsman in Test cricket. "", 'But he never quite convinced England about his aptitude in one-day cricket.

He fought back courageously after a six-month lay-off, aided by the memories of the taunts he had received while laying stricken on the outfield, and by March 2004, he was back to a good pace and preparing himself for a tour of the Caribbean.

In 1965 he returned career-best figures of 13-9-11-8 on a damp wicket at Leicester, and that winter featured as a key member of England's Ashes side, taking his Test-best 6 for 118 at Adelaide.

Rather than slipping out of the game, he rediscovered his pace and ambition in one of English cricket's story-book recoveries. England, pummelled by the Australian Mitchell Johnson, and eager to find an out-and-out quick bowler of their own, liked what they saw during a Lions recall, and he played the four Tests of the 2014 summer as a shock trooper - two each against Sri Lanka and India - before succumbing to injury.  \n"", ""Plunkett's return was not entirely untroubled; at times his control deserted him and his around-the-wicket approach did not always drum up the anticipated menace. But he stayed true to the exhortations of Yorkshire's coach, Jason Gillespie, to keep it simple and just bowl fast and he took 18 wickets in four Tests, with his match figures of nine for 176 against Sri Lanka on his adopted home ground of Headingley the highlight, a feat overshadowed by Sri Lanka's last-over win. Sternly bearded, with an upright style and strikingly gym-honed upper body, he regularly exceeded speeds of 90mph, but England seemed to conclude that subtlety and control was missing and thereafter chose to utilise him exclusively in white-ball cricket."", ""Plunkett's initial selection for England's tour of Pakistan and India in 2005-06 represented the culmination of a two-year rise to prominence.  A bustling fast-medium seamer blessed with an ability to bowl an occasional unplayable ball and a powerful striker down the order, he briefly promised to have a lengthy international career only for issues with his control - and, in his final season at Durham in 2012, a loss of confidence in his action - to lower his sights."", 'Having made his first-class debut for Durham in 2003, Plunkett took on immediate responsibilities in the absence of Steve Harmison and the injured Mark Davies, and in 2005 took 50 wickets in a season for the first time. He made his Test debut in a thumping England defeat against Pakistan in Lahore, following the withdrawal of Simon Jones with an ankle injury, and announced himself as a capable allrounder with a composed half-century in only his second ODI against the same opposition. ', ""He was selected for England's Ashes campaign in Australia in 2006-7 and for seven gruelling weeks he was the forgotten man of a dismal Test tour. But as England, against all predictions, regrouped to win the one-day series, he seized his opportunity to impress with 12 wickets in the one-day series, including 3 for 43 in the decisive second final against Australia. It was a performance that secured his World Cup passage, though he only played three games and lacked the incisiveness he had shown in Australia."", ""A lack of England engagements freed Plunkett up for his Durham duties, and in 2007 he played a role in their first domestic trophy triumph, in their sixteenth year of first-class status, taking three wickets as Durham won the rain-interrupted Friends Provident final by 125 runs at Lord's. A regular in England Lions squads, Plunkett spent a winter as the Dolphins' overseas player in South Africa in 2007-08 and shared in Durham's Championship success the following summer. Durham retained the title in 2009 and Plunkett was at the forefront of their success with 49 wickets in the season, including match figures of 9 for 149 in the innings win over Nottinghamshire that sealed the title."", ""Plunkett looked set for a second crack at international cricket when he was named in England's squad for their Test series against South Africa in 2009-10, but he was overtaken by the likes of Graham Onions, his Durham team mate, Stuart Broad and Ajmal Shahzad in the fast-bowling ranks and has had to be content with sporadic appearances since. "", 'Subsequently, a combination of injuries and problems with his action saw Plunkett slip down the pecking order at Durham and after two lean seasons, amounting to three Championship appearances, he was told he could look for a new county. Yorkshire took the opportunity to offer him a three-year contract, enabling him to team up again with his former Durham coach, Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket at Headingley, who like Gillespie proved a positive influence. He immediately showed signs of a resurgence, taking 36 wickets in 12 Championship matches. Yorkshire capped him. As he was born in Middlesbrough - part of the old county boundaries  - they felt they had been entitled to him all along. \n', '\n']",[],13.0,20,5,238.0,55*,15.86,509,46.75,0,1,31,0,3.0,0.0,78.0,45,15,584.0,56,19.46,588,99.31,0,1,46,17,25.0,0.0,22.0,11,4,42.0,18,6.00,34,123.52,0,0,3,1,7.0,0.0,155.0,213,39,4376,126,25.14,,,3,22,,,86,0,200.0,124,45,1586,72,20.07,1575,100.69,0,3,,,61,0,146.0,87,34,777,41,14.66,592,131.25,0,0,55,25,39,0,13.0,25,2659,1536,41.0,5/64,9/176,37.46,3.46,64.8,1,1,0,78.0,76,3627,3557,116.0,5/52,5/52,30.66,5.88,31.2,5,1,0,22.0,22,476,627,25.0,3/21,3/21,25.08,7.9,19.0,0,0,0,155.0,,23711,14273,452,6/33,,31.57,3.61,52.4,19,11,1,200.0,,8574,7912,257,5/52,5/52,30.78,5.53,33.3,10,1,0,146.0,140,2782,3723,136,5/31,5/31,27.37,8.02,20.4,1,1,0,False,False,False,False

He played in a few matches for Notts at the beginning of the past season, but his condition was very bad, and his friends knew he would not be able to go on for long. During the summer he spent some time at a sanatorium in the New Forest, but nothing could be done for him, consumption being too far advanced. He went home, given up as incurable, and the end came as a release from his sufferings. Born on August 16, 1872, Mr. Jones played his first match for Notts against Lancashire at Trent Bridge in 1892. Helping Notts to a victory by six wickets, he at once gave proof of his brilliant qualities as a cricketer. The match was a remarkable one. Notts--a great side that season--had 222 to get to win. As he had made 17 not out in the first innings, Jones was selected to go in with Shrewsbury, and between them the two batsmen scored 75 for the first wicket, putting their side on the high road to victory. They might have done more, but a brilliant run out ended the partnership. Jones was then up at Cambridge, but he only played once against Oxford at Lord's, being on the winning side in 1893. He was rather slow to develop as a batsman, his full powers being, perhaps, first revealed in a superb innings of 98 in the Whit-Monday match between Notts and Surrey in 1896. Richard Daft said of that innings that he had never seen anyone play Tom Richardson so well. Jones's great days began three years later, and from 1899 to 1907 he was, except in one season, at his very best. In the winter of 1907-8, when in Australia as a captain of the M. C. C.'s team, he had a severe illness, from the effects of which he perhaps never wholly recovered. However, he was able to resume his career in England in 1908, and continued to play as much cricket as ever. Early in the season of 1913 he contracted a violent chill, playing on a bitterly cold afternoon at Manchester. This kept him out of the field for more than two months, and no doubt brought on the illness which ended in his premature death. \n"", ""It is essentially as a Notts cricketer that Mr. Jones will be remembered. Nearly all his best work was done for his county. He only played five times for England against Australia in this country, and when he paid his first visit to Australia as a member of Mr. MacLaren's team in 1901-2, he failed to do himself justice as a batsman. Always rather eager and impetuous, he had not quite the right temperament for Test match cricket. All through his career his fielding was even finer than his batting. Indeed it may be claimed for him that a better all-round fieldsman has never been seen. Unequalled in his favourite position in the slips--a sort of short third man--he was almost as brilliant in the deep field, and in the England v. Australia match at Birmingham in 1909 he made a catch at short-leg that has become historical. As an orthodox slip fieldsman he was seen at his highest pitch in the England v. Australia match at Trent Bridge in 1905, and the Gentlemen v. Players match at Lord's in 1907. He succeeded Mr. J. A. Dixon as captain of the Notts team in 1900, and held that position until he had to give up cricket last summer. Under his leadership Notts won the county championship in 1907. As a batsman he was essentially a brilliant player, his hitting on the off-side being wonderfully fine. His position at the wicket, with legs wide apart and both knees bent, was rather cramped and ungainly, but once the ball had left the bowler's hand all awkwardness vanished. In hitting he was always free and graceful. He and Iremonger put up the hundred together for the first Notts wicket 24 times. In his young days Mr. Jones excelled in Rugby football, and of late years, in connection with that game, he was, by general consent, one of the best of referees."", '*The highest score ever made in Nottinghamshire cricket. \x86Signifies not out.', 'Totalling 727 completed innings.

In his time as captain, which embraced an Ashes-winning tour, his insistence on fielding only players of his choice was seen as a sign of independence. But when, as chairman, he denied his captains the same right, apparent strength of mind was exposed as pig-headedness. The most damaging example was his refusal to let Mike Atherton have Alec Stewart, rather than Illy's choice Jack Russell, keeping wicket in the 1996 World Cup. Illingworth's greatest gift as captain lay in creating the illusion that he had 14 or 15 players on the field: so expertly did he block a batsman's favourable scoring strokes that when the opposition were in trouble it must frequently have seemed that there were no runs on offer anywhere. In that, Illingworth was much helped by the accuracy of his own offspin - a miserly 1.91 runs per over in his 61 Tests. He was a shade under 6ft tall, and sturdily built. His batting, normally at No. 6 or 7, was built on an orthodox technique and absolute determination not to give away his wicket, which was reflected by a fifth of his innings finishing not out, sometimes to the disadvantage of his teams.

These figures naturally suggest the question, why was he picked so often and so long? The answer is that, though at the time England had such bats as Hutton, Washbrook, Compton and Edrich and, at the end of the period, May and Cowdrey, there was not the depth of batting there had been before the war: two or three reliable players ere wanted to support the stars and crises were frequent. One gets the impression that the selectors, at a loss to fill the gap, constantly fell back on Ikin. \n', ""He was essentially a sound player, though in his young days stronger on the off than on the leg. He was determined and could be trusted not to throw his wicket away stupidly. He was left-handed, he was adaptable and equally happy to open or to go in six or seven. Above all he was a superb field, whether at short leg or in the slips. Though he never made a big score for England, he often played bravely when runs were wanted. At Sydney in 1946-47 his 60, made in three hours, was the second-highest innings in a total of 255, while at Melbourne in a desperate situation he made 48 and helped Yardley to put on 113 in two hours. In 1951 against South Africa at Trent Bridge his 33 was top score in the second innings, at Lord's he made 51 and at Old Trafford, where he faced bravely a fierce battering form McCarthy, his 22 and 38, made as Hutton's opening partner, were important contributions in a low-scoring match. In 1952 he made 53 against India at The Oval. In 1955, after a three-year absence, he was recalled as one of five left-handers to counter Goddard's leg-theory, but the experiment was not a success."", ""Born at Stoke-on-Trent, he played for Staffordshire in 1934 at the age of sixteen gained a regular place in the side in 1936 and in 1938, when he headed the batting, was picked for the Minor Counties against Oxford University. In 1939 he appeared in four matches for Lancashire and took his first wicket in first-class cricket, that of the great George Headley. Playing regularly for Lancashire in 1946, he was picked for England before he had got his county cap and that winter went with MCC to Australia, where he played in all the Tests. In 1947-48 he was a member of G. O. Allen's side to the West Indies, but was a failure. His only other tour was with a Commonwealth team to India in 1950-51. Here he had the most prolific season of his career, heading the averages in the unofficial Tests with 625 runs and average of 89.28. An injury forced him to refuse the MCC tour to India the following winter. For Lancashire he did splendid work as a batsman and was also useful as a leg-break and googly bowler. Against Somerset at Taunton in 1949 he did the hat-trick. His highest score was 192 against Oxford University at Oxford in 1951. Latterly he missed a good deal of cricket through ill health and injury and it was this that caused him to retire at the end of 1957."", 'However, his career was far from over. He rejoined Staffordshire and continued to play for them until 1968, scoring heavily and captaining them from 1957 to 1967. In 1965-66 he was assistant manager on the MCC tour to Australia and New Zealand, and after retiring from active cricket he did much coaching in the North and Midlands. Gentle, generous and friendly, he perhaps lacked the toughness to make quite the most of a considerable natural talent. In all first-class cricket he scored 17,968 runs with an average of 36.81 and took 339 wickets at 30.27.

6 ft 4 in ",,Top-order batsman,Right-hand bat,Right-arm offbreak,,,,"[""\nFew cricketers have divided opinion like Kevin Pietersen. When he was unceremoniously dumped from England's set up early in 2014, with lawyers at the ready on all sides, he was presented by those in authority as an egotistical individualist whose reluctance to respect those in charge forever undermined attempts to build a strong team ethic. Whatever view you held, Pietersen deserved to be recognised as one of the most captivating cricketers to pull on an England shirt. His flamboyant strokeplay was at the heart of many of England's finest performances for a decade. A brazen belief in his own ability, moments of outrageous unorthodoxy and, at times, a surprising vulnerability on and off the field have all combined to give him great box-office appeal.  \n"", ""His 8,181 Test runs at 47.28 in 104 Tests had few rivals in England's history and his record in limited-overs cricket was also outstanding. In 2013, he became the highest England run-scorer in all international forms of the game combined. But Pietersen's ability to command attention on the field has been matched only by his ability to divide opinion off it. After more than nine years and many controversies, Pietersen's England career was at an end, a fact he wrestled with interminably: accepting it one day, holding out hope of a miraculous return the next. He had no choice but to commit himself to the life of a T20 specialist."", 'For many England cricket fans, no name sparks more excitement. But his celebrity status, individualistic streak and outspoken ways often grated with the England cricket authorities who prefer their star names to be more malleable and conservative. The English media, which has at times been vitriolic - not to say personal - about his rebellious streak has generally recognised that he has few peers.', 'An attempt to introduce him into the inner sanctum, by appointing him England captain in August 2008, lasted only five months as his relationship with the coach, Peter Moores, was uncomfortable from the outset. Their differences simmered throughout a troubled tour of India and when the rift became public Pietersen was forced to resign early in the New Year with a disenchanted Moores sacked on the same day. ', ""Another dispute arose in May 2012 when Pietersen, agitating for the freedom to play for longer in the Indian Premier League - where his popularity was unquestioned - briefly announced his retirement from all forms of limited-overs international cricket. Pietersen's frustration had a disruptive effect on England's summer Test series against South Africa. The ECB regarded the matter as an unacceptable display of player power. He was dropped for the final Test at The Oval and omitted from World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, England predictable struggling in his absence."", ""Pietersen was born in Pietermaritzburg to an Afrikaner father, Jannie, and an English mother, Penny, and abandoned South Africa cricket as a teenager in protest against the racial quota system which he felt was unfairly restricting his opportunities at KwaZulu Natal. He joined Nottinghamshire in 2000, attracted by the chance to work with Clive Rice, the county's coach and a former South Africa allrounder, but left at the end of the 2003 season after Nottinghamshire were relegated, unhappy with the standard of the Trent Bridge pitches and expressed his feelings strongly enough for the captain, Jason Gallian, to fling his kit out of the dressing room window. He signed for Hampshire, where he remained until 2010, at which point he decamped to Surrey to be close to his Chelsea home, but by then his county appearances had long become sporadic."", 'His England career began in a low-key one-day series in Zimbabwe in 2004 when Andrew Flintoff was ""rested"" after expressing moral misgivings about the political regime of Robert Mugabe. Pietersen averaged 104 in England\'s 4-0 victory. A subsequent tour of South Africa was more daunting, but he produced three audacious centuries in the series, his unbeaten 100 in 69 balls becoming England\'s quickest ODI hundred. He went on to reach 1000 one-day runs in just 21 innings - equalling Viv Richards\' record. ', ""Test cricket beckoned with the 2005 Ashes the following summer: Pietersen's selection ahead of Graham Thorpe representing the toughest selectorial decision of early summer. He sealed the return of the urn after 17 years with a stroke-filled 158 at The Oval on the final day of the series. England needed to avoid defeat to regain the Ashes and Pietersen was dropped three times on the way to 60, but tension gave way to scenes of jubilation as his adrenalin-charged climax included seven sixes, breaking Ian Botham's record for England in an Ashes Test. He was named man of the match, finished an uneven series as top scorer, with 473 runs at 52.55 and, like the rest of the side, was awarded an MBE amid an atmosphere of national jubilation. He was also named as one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year."", ""The subsequent years were a whirl of exciting innings, occasional rash dismissals and celebrity engagements. Sri Lanka's visit to England in 2006 was a high point. He matched his highest Test score of 158 in the first Test and in the following Test at Edgbaston, to general incredulity he unveiled the Switch Hit as he reversed his stance to slog-sweep Muttiah Muralitharan for six. There was no more appropriate way for a player of Pietersen's razzamatazz to become the first batsman since Graham Gooch in 1990 to score a century in three successive Test innings in England. The MCC ruled in 2008 that the shot was legal. He was up for the challenge, too, in Australia in 2006-7, averaging more than 50, and in the World Cup which followed, but England were a ramshackle lot as Flintoff, the captain, and coach Duncan Fletcher rarely had a meeting of minds. "", ""Soon it was time for his ill-fated tilt at the England captaincy. His tenure officially began when Michael Vaughan, the Test captain, retired and Paul Collingwood stood down as ODI captain at the same time. Pietersen started with a century and victory against South Africa at The Oval but that was perhaps as close as he ever got to acceptance from the establishment. England's ODI series against India ended prematurely because of terrorist attacks on Mumbai, but England returned to fulfil the Test tour amid unprecedented security as Pietersen expressed the need not to be cowed by terrorism. But behind the scenes Pietersen's relationship was deteriorating with Moores, a coach with no international experience and an unrelenting work ethic. Pietersen recommended, rather too publicly, that Moores be removed and got his way, only to be summarily sacked as well. His relationship with the ECB never entirely recovered. Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower, who took over as captain and coach, had much healing to undertake."", ""Alongside brushes with management - a feature in all the teams he has played for - injuries have interrupted him at key moments. His 2009 Ashes campaign was cut short by leg trouble that needed surgery and he left the 2011 World Cup with a hernia. His form became mercurial rather than reliable and he seemed to develop a curious fallibility against a succession of left-arm spinners, some more renowned than others. But he ended a 20-month wait for an international century by making a career-best 227 as England won the Ashes in Australia for the first time in 24 years, then scored 533 runs at 106.60 in England's 4-0 home whitewashing of India that secured them the No.1 ranking in Tests. His reputation as one of England's greats could no longer be denied."", ""He was also the Man of the Tournament in England's World Twenty20 win in 2010 but his one-day batting tailed off, with no centuries over a three-year period between 2009 and 2011. He scored two in successive innings against Pakistan in 2012 - including his highest ODI score of 130 - and, briefly, it appeared they would be his last innings in coloured kit for England when he announced his retirement from limited-overs internationals, briefly seduced by the attractions of IPL. "", 'England\'s Test against South Africa at Headingley in 2012 captured his career in microcosm. His power struggle with the ECB had left him moody and unpredictable before the Test, but when the match began he struck a quite brilliant 149 and, in the process, became the fastest man in terms of time, to reach 7,000 Test runs. That was quickly followed by more off-field drama, as reports of derogatory text messages about his captain, Strauss, to South Africa players, filled the media. Pietersen was dropped for the next Test at Lord\'s and, even though he did an about turn and reconfirmed his desire to play for England in all formats, forgiveness did not come quickly enough for him to play in World Twenty20. When he was officially invited back into the ranks, in Colombo, he had to sit next to the ECB chairman, Giles Clarke, as details of his ""reintegration process"" were sternly issued.  His response was to bat as well as ever. His 186 in Mumbai was a jewel in England\'s crown as they won a Test series in India for the first time in 28 years.', 'The detente was short-lived, however, as cracks reappeared on England\'s disastrous 2013-14 tour of Australia where, despite being the leading run-scorer - a modest achievement in the circumstances - rumours surfaced of a further deterioration in his relationship with Flower. Although Flower himself resigned, the ECB decided to cut its losses a few days later and summarily brought down the curtain on Pietersen\'s England career as well, citing a need to rebuilt ""team ethic and philosophy"". An autobiography published later that year was arguably the most outspoken in cricket history as he launched an emotional attack on those he felt had wronged him. It was a desperately sad end.\n', '\n']","['ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2005', 'ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2006']",104.0,181,8,8181.0,227,47.28,13255,61.72,23,35,985,81,62.0,0.0,136.0,125,16,4440.0,130,40.73,5128,86.58,9,25,427,77,40.0,0.0,37.0,36,5,1176.0,79,37.93,831,141.51,0,7,119,32,14.0,0.0,217.0,358,26,16522,355*,49.76,,,50,71,,,152,0,253.0,233,34,8112,147,40.76,,,15,46,,,85,0,200.0,193,25,5695,115*,33.89,4160,136.89,3,35,495,220,66,0,104.0,58,1311,886,10.0,3/52,4/78,88.6,4.05,131.1,0,0,0,136.0,23,400,370,7.0,2/22,2/22,52.85,5.55,57.1,0,0,0,37.0,3,30,53,1.0,1/27,1/27,53.00,10.6,30.0,0,0,0,217.0,,6443,3760,73,4/31,,51.50,3.50,88.2,,0,0,253.0,,2390,2122,41,3/14,3/14,51.75,5.32,58.2,0,0,0,200.0,30,396,534,17,3/33,3/33,31.41,8.09,23.2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

5 ft 7 in ",,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm fast,,"['Brother - ', ',', 'Son - ']",,"['\nThe ""Croucher"" (so named for his somewhat odd stance) was one of the most exciting players of his, or any era. A fast bowler good enough to be selected for England purely in this role, a superlative cover fielder, Jessop is best remembered for his thrilling batsmanship. To quote HS Altham ""no cricketer that has ever lived hit the ball so often, so fast and with such a bewildering variety of strokes"". By no means a big man at 5\'7"" and 11 stone, he was a powerful driver, fierce cutter and hooker, but could also play delicate late cuts and glances. In his best innings he scored at rates of close to 100 runs/hour. He debuted for his native county, Gloucestershire at the age of 20, and arrived at the wicket to save a hat trick by striking his first delivery in county cricket for 4. His great innings included 286 in less than 3 hours, 157 runs in an hour against the West Indian team of 1900, and famously, the century that won the Oval Test of 1902. Going in with England 48/5 he made 104 out of 139 in 75 minutes, taking England to an improbable victory. Originally a fast bowler, he strained his back when overbowled in his first Test match in 1899, and afterwards was less effective. As a fielder, the power and accuracy of his returns from cover combined with fleetness of foot made him the undisputed master of that position prior to the Great War. Named after WG Grace, he eventually followed him as captain of Gloucestershire, and later club secretary. Originally a school teacher, Jessop married an Australian met on the boat returning from the 1901-2 tour (his son later played for Hampshire), and in later years moved to London where he wrote and was secretary to a golf club. Due to poor health he retired young, but lived to over 80.\n', ' \n', ' ', ""\nGilbert Laird Jessop, who died at St. George's Vicarage, Dorchester, on May 11, aged 80, was famed as the most remarkable hitter cricket has ever produced. He had lived with the Rev. Gilbert Jessop, his only child, from 1936 till his death."", 'Born at Cheltenham on May 19, 1874, he enjoyed a memorable career in first-class cricket which, dating from 1894 to the start of the First World War, extended over twenty years. There have been batsmen who hit the ball even harder than Jessop, notably C. I. Thornton and the two Australians, George Bonnor and Jack Lyons, but no one who did so more often or who, in match after match, scored as rapidly. Where Jessop surpassed all other hitters was in the allround nature of his scoring. At his best, he could make runs from any ball, however good it might be. Although only 5ft 7ins in height, he bent low as he shaped to play, a method which earned him the sobriquet of The Croucher. Extraordinarily quick on his feet, he was ready to hit firm-footed if the ball were pitched well up and equally, when it was of shorter length, to dash down the pitch and drive. When executing leg-side strokes, he almost lay down and swept round with the bat practically horizontal, putting great power behind the ball as, thanks to strong, supple wrists, he also did when bringing off the square cut. Lightness of foot allied to wonderful sight made it possible for him to run out to the fastest bowlers of his time -- Richardson and Mold -- and at the peak of his form pull or straight-drive them with almost unerring certainty. No one ever approached him in this particular feat; indeed, nobody else could have attempted it with reasonable hope of success.', 'At times Jessop sacrificed his wicket through trying to hit before he got a true sight of the ball or judged the pace of the turf and, not unnaturally in view of the liberties he took with good length bowling, the ball which kept low often dismissed him. A batsman with such marvellous gifts that in half an hour he might win a game seemingly lost, he was a wonderful personality on the field and the idol of spectators who always love a fearless batsman.', ""Jessop's claims to distinction were not limited to the brilliancy of his run-getting. For a number of years he ranked high as a fast bowler and for a man of his pace he showed surprising stamina. Far more remarkable than his bowling, however, was his fielding, which might fairly be termed as phenomenal as his hitting and which was a matter of great pride to him. No hit proved too hard for him to stop and his gathering and returning of the ball approached perfection. In his early days he fielded at cover-point; later he specialised in the position of extra mid-off, standing so deep that with almost anyone else a run would have been a certainty.  Jessop's presence deterred the boldest of batsmen from making any attempt. In short, such a fine bowler and such a superb fieldsman was he that, even without his batting ability, he would have been worth a place in almost any team. A man of engaging manners, he was a charming companion and, like most truly great men, modest to a degree."", 'First tried for Gloucestershire in 1894,  Jessop established his reputation a year later when, among other performances, he hit 63 out of 65 in less than half an hour from the Yorkshire bowling at Cheltenham. He continued to assist Gloucestershire till the end of his first-class career and for thirteen years from 1900 he captained the side. By 1897 he had become one of the great players of the day, making 1,219 runs in first-class matches and taking 116 wickets for less than 18 runs each. In that summer he hit two particularly noteworthy innings - 140 for Cambridge University against the Philadelphians in 95 minutes and 101 out of l18 in 40 minutes against  Yorkshire at Harrogate. In the course of the latter display he hit the ball six times out of the ground and some dozen times over the ropes. Until 1907 a hit over the ropes counted four; only a hit out of the ground earned six. Except in 1898 he regularly made over 1,000 runs every season until 1909, when a bad back injury sustained while fielding in the Test match at Leeds in early July kept him out of the game for the rest of the year. In 1900 he scored 2,210 runs and took 104 wickets and next summer his aggregate amounted to 2,323, including 157 out of 201 in an hour against West Indies at Bristol.', ""Among his 53 centuries were five of more than 200: 286 out of 335 in 175 minutes for Gloucestershire against Sussex at Brighton, 1903(he and J. H. Board adding 320 for the sixth wicket); 240 out of 337 in 200 minutes for Gloucestershire v. Sussex at Bristol, 1907; 234 out of 346 in 155 minutes for Gloucestershire v. Somerset at Bristol, 1905; 233 out of 318 in 150 minutes for An England XI v. Yorkshire at  Lord's, 1901; and 206 out of 317 in 150 minutes for  Gloucestershire v. Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge,  1904."", 'Four times for Gloucestershire he reached three figures in each innings of a match: 104 and 139 v. Yorkshire at Bradford, 1900, when the newspapers stated that, in the two innings he cleared the ropes more than twenty times; 143 and 133 not out v. Somerset at Bath,  1908; 161 and 129 v. Hampshire at Bristol, 1909; and 153 and 123 not out v. Hampshire at Southampton, 1911. He achieved the feat on another occasion, against Somerset in a friendly game organised for the opening of a new club pavilion. S. M. J. Woods termed this a remarkable performance on a pitch far from true and against professional bowling. Altogether in first-class cricket he hit 26,058 runs, average 32.60.', 'His bowling successes included 8 wickets for 34 runs v. Hampshire, 1898; 5 for 13 v. Lancashire, 1895; 8 for 54 v. Lancashire, 1898; 8 for 29 v. Essex, 1900; 8 for 58 v. Middlesex, 1902. All these were achieved for Gloucestershire except that against Hampshire, on which occasion he was playing for Cambridge. His wickets in first-class cricket totalled 851, average 22.91.', "" Jessop took part in eighteen Test matches between 1899 and 1909, thirteen against Australia and five against South Africa, and would probably have appeared in others but for the back strain he suffered in l909. He disappointed in  Australia except for his fielding, and in most of the contests in England met with moderate success; but he earned undying fame in The Oval Test of 1902. There, under conditions considerably helpful to bowlers, England, set 273 to make to win, lost their first five wickets for 48.  Australia looked to have the match in hand, but Jessop joined F. S. Jackson and in marvellous fashion hit 104 out of 139 in an hour and a quarter, paving the way to victory by one wicket for England. Twice he sent the ball on to the roof of the Pavilion and from another big hit was caught on the Players' Balcony by H. K. Foster."", 'Jessop went to Cambridge in 1896 and played for the University for four seasons, being captain in 1899. He accomplished little of note against Oxford in the way of batting, two innings of over 40 being his best scores on the big occasion, but he bowled to good purpose in two of the games, taking six wickets for 65 in the first innings in 1897 and six for 126 in the first innings a year later.', ""Besides his cricketing ability, Jessop was an allround athlete of note. He got his Blue as a hockey goalkeeper, but fell ill and could not play in the University match; came near getting an Association football Blue and played for The Casuals as half-back or goalkeeper. He also appeared as a wing-threequarter for Gloucester R.F.C. He would have played billiards for Cambridge against Oxford, but was gated and could not take part. In one week he made two breaks of over 150. He could run the 100 yards in 10.2 seconds and frequently entered for sports meetings. A scratch golfer, he took part in the Amateur Championship in 1914, was Secretary of the Cricketers' Golfing Society and for some years Secretary of the Edgware Club."", 'In addition to the visit he paid to Australia in 1901-02 under A. C. MacLaren, he went to America with the team captained by P. F. Warner in 1897, and again in 1899 when K. S. Ranjitsinhji led the side.', 'For Beccles School in 1895, when a master there, Jessop scored 1,058 runs, average 132, and took 100 wickets at a cost of less than two and a half runs apiece.', 'He served as a captain in the Manchester Regiment during the First World War from 1914 till he was invalided out with a damaged heart in 1918. Married in October 1902, he first met his bride a few months earlier during his visit to Australia. She died in 1953.', 'Tributes paid to Jessop include:', 'Sir Pelham Warner: ""He was a wonderful cricketer. It was a great pleasure to play with or against him. It has been said that he was unorthodox, but no one watched the ball more closely.""', 'Sir John Hobbs: ""He was undoubtedly the most consistently fast scorer I have seen. He was a big hitter, too, and it was difficult to bowl a ball from which he could not score. He made me glad that I was not a bowler.  Gilbert Jessop certainly drew the crowds, too, even more than Bradman, I should say.""\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1898'],18.0,26,0,569.0,104,21.88,,,1,3,,3,11.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,493.0,855,37,26698,286,32.63,,,53,127,,,463,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18.0,14,732,354,10.0,4/68,4/91,35.4,2.90,73.2,1,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,493.0,,42442,19904,873,8/29,,22.79,2.81,48.6,,41,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Highly regarded by the England management, and viewed as captaincy material, he was a batsman for the future at a time when the prolific career of his fellow England left-hander, Alastair Cook, was nearing its end. But life proved more taxing for Jennings than had been imagined. But the time Cook retired, he had played 22 Test innings and had added only one more half-century, that also on his debut India tour. \n', ""Jennings' career took shape in fine style in 2016 when, at 24, he was named as the County Championship player of the year by the Cricket Writers' Club. It recognised a season in which he had been the leading run-scorer in the competition with 1,548 runs at an average of 64.5 with seven hundreds, including a double century against Yorkshire. His career-best 88 as Durham were beaten finalists in the NatWest Blast was also the highest score during Twenty20 finals day. "", ""England recognition came on the 2016 tour to India, as a replacement for the injured Hasseb Hameed, and he made an immediate impact with a century on debut in Mumbai. Subsequent leadership experience with England Lions, plus the Durham 50-over captaincy, saw him identified as a potential Test captain, but his form plummeted the following summer and after eight innings against South Africa without a half-century, his footwork increasingly static, he was dropped after six Tests. Eager to press his England claims, and concerned about Durham's faltering status on and off the field, he sought salvation with a move to Lancashire."", ""He topped the averages in his first Lancashire season, and won a recall to the Test side, initially against Pakistan, and then for a home series against India - Cook's last - but often got out after doing the hard work. The freewheeling county strokeplay of 2016 had become a distant memory."", 'Jennings, a tall left-handed batsman, made his first-class debut for Gauteng against Free State in his native Johannesburg in December 2011 aged 19, having spent a season with Durham, where he made 1,319 runs in Academy and Second XI matches. He is a former South Africa Under-19 captain who led the touring side in England in 2011 and is the son of former South Africa coach Ray Jennings, but committed himself to serving a four-year qualification period to become eligible for England. ', 'His strong north-east links should not be discounted - his mother is from Sunderland - but his arrival at Chester-le-Street owed more to the friendship Durham coach Geoff Cook struck up with his father when they played domestic cricket in South Africa, Cook for Eastern Province, Jennings for Transvaal.  ', 'A patient batsman with an old-fashioned willingness to occupy the crease, Jennings enjoyed a prolific 2nd XI season in 2012 and earned his first-class Durham debut against Surrey in August 2012, a week after making 201 for the Seconds against Ireland A. He made a favourable impression with an assured 70 spanning two and a half hours against Lancashire at Aigburth in his third first-class match for the county.', ""For a while he struggled to progress, his innings often conducted on challenging Riverside surfaces, but relief came in his first full season against Derbyshire at Chester-le-Street in July. He compiled an increasingly careworn 90 in the first innings, but that proved to be a scouting mission for his maiden Championship hundred second time around: a more assured 123 before he was run out.

He caught tick fever while visiting Southern Rhodesia in 1957 and thenceforward had been in poor health. \n"", 'The son of MR Jardine, himself an Oxford Blue, Douglas Jardine was born at Bombay and educated at Winchester, where he was in the XI for three years, being captain in the last, 1919, when he headed the batting figures with 997 runs, average 66.46. Going up to New College, Oxford, he got his Blue as a Freshman and played against Cambridge in 1920, 1921 and  1923 without achieving anything out of the ordinary. He missed the 1922 University match because of a damaged knee. In 1923 he began to play for Surrey and in 1932 took over the captaincy from PGH Fender.', ""He went to  Australia in 1928-29 with the MCC team under APF Chapman, taking part in all five Test matches. To England's success by 12 runs in the fourth Test he made a big contribution when scoring 98 and sharing with WR Hammond in a third-wicket partnership of 262. He also enjoyed the distinction of hitting three centuries in successive innings, against Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales."", 'Four years later he captained the MCC side in Australia in what was probably the most controversial tour in history. England won four of the five Tests, but it was the methods they employed rather than the results which caused so much discussion and acrimony. H. Larwood and W. Voce, the Nottinghamshire fast bowlers, exploited leg-theory, or what came to be known as body-line bowling to a packed leg-side field. The Australians and others considered this means of attack placed batsmen at a grave disadvantage because they had either to risk being struck on the head or body by persistently short-pitched balls or, if they attempted to play them, were virtually certain to be caught by the close-set field.', 'Strongly-worded cables passed between the Australian Board of Control, who asserted that Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace the best interests of the game, making protection of the body the main consideration, and the MCC. The Australians threatened to call off the projected tour of England in 1934. MCC at length agreed that a form of bowling which is obviously a direct attack by the bowler upon the batsman would be an offence against the spirit of the game. Jardine always defended his tactics and in a book he wrote about the tour described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful.', 'Finally in 1934 MCC issued a ruling:  That the type of bowling regarded as a direct attack by the bowler upon the batsman, and therefore unfair, consists in persistent and systematic bowling of fast and short-pitched balls at the batsman standing clear of his wicket. That was the end of body-line bowling.', 'Meanwhile in 1933, however, fast leg-theory had been employed by both England and the West Indies in the second Test match at Old Trafford. Jardine, who always held that this type of attack could be successfully countered by a resolute batsman, set out to prove the accuracy of his contention. For nearly five hours he faced the hostile pace of LN Constantine and EA Martindale and he hit 127, his first and only century in a Test match. In the process, he took much physical punishment, but The Iron Duke, as he was sometimes called, had proved his point to his own satisfaction.', 'Jardine captained the MCC team in India the following winter, but thereafter his appearances on the field became fewer till in 1937 he dropped out of first-class cricket altogether. At the same time he maintained his interest in the game, being President of the Oxford University CC from 1955 to 1957 and making occasional contributions to the Press. In 1953 he became the first President of the Association of Cricket Umpires.', 'Six feet tall, he possessed a very strong defence and was specially skilful in on-side strokes. In 22 Test match appearances he hit 1296 runs, average 48, and held 26 catches. During his career his runs numbered 14,821, average 46.90, the highest of his 35 centuries being 214 not out against Tasmania in 1928-29. Extremely proud of his Oxford associations, he always wore a Harlequin cap.', 'Tributes included:', ' In my humble opinion, Jardine was a very fine captain, both on and off the field, and in the committee-room he was also extremely good. If ever there was a cricket match between England and the rest of the world and the fate of England depended upon its result, I would pick  Jardine as England captain every time.', ' I played with him a lot in the Surrey side and I feel that he will be chiefly remembered as a splendid skipper. As a captain, I would rank him second only to PGH Fender. He was a great batsman -- how great I do not think we quite appreciated at the time. I remember that he was the first man to refer to me as ""The Master"".', ' To me and every member of the 1932-33 MCC side in Australia, Douglas Jardine was the greatest captain England ever had. A great fighter, a grand friend and an unforgiving enemy.', ' Jardine was a great player and captain and a man of character who, like all men of character, was not liked by everybody. He did what he set out to do, as when his side won The Ashes in Australia in 1932-33, even if the method he adopted did not meet with general approval.

Primarily he was a bowler, the second in the remarkable succession of slow left-handers -- Edmund Peate, Peel, Wilfred Rhodes and Hedley Verity -- who rendered such brilliant service to Yorkshire over a period of sixty years. Born at Churwell, near Leeds, on February 12, 1857,  Bobby Peel first played for his county in 1882, when  Yorkshire were singularly rich in bowling talent, so that he had to wait several years before attaining real distinction. Still, being a capital fieldsman, especially at cover-point, and a punishing left-handed batsman, he kept his place in the team, and when Peate's connection with the county ceased in unhappy circumstances Peel came to the fore. For nine seasons, with his fine length, easy action and splendid command of spin, this sturdily built left-hander regularly took over 100 wickets for Yorkshire, his county total amounting to 1,550 at an average cost of 15 runs each. He was often a match-winner. In 1887 he took five Kent wickets for 14 runs in an innings and, with 43 runs in a low-scoring match, helped largely in a victory by four wickets. In the same season eleven Leicestershire wickets fell to him for 51 runs at Dewsbury, five in the  first innings for four runs. A year later he took eight  Nottinghamshire wickets in an innings for 12 runs, while in 1892 five wickets for seven runs in an innings and eight for 33 in the match against Derbyshire at Leeds was a startling performance. He did even better in 1895 against  Somerset, 15 wickets falling to him in 36 overs for 5 runs, nine for 22 in one innings causing a sensation. At Halifax in 1897, a month before his county career ended, Peel dismissed eight Kent men in an innings for 53 runs, his match average showing eleven for 85; this performance gave  Yorkshire an innings victory with 103 runs to spare in two days. Peel's full return in bowling in first-class cricket was 1,754 wickets at 16.21 runs apiece. \n"", ""He did some remarkable things in Test matches with Australia, against whom he played for England twenty times. At Sydney in  1894, Australia set to get 177, hit off 113 of the runs for the loss of two wickets before stumps were drawn on the fifth day. The result then appeared a foregone conclusion, but strong sunshine followed heavy rain during the night.  Peel slept through the storm. Astounded when he saw the drying pitch, he said to the English captain, Mr. Stoddart, gie me t' ball, and with Johnny Briggs, the Lancashire left-hander, also at his best, the remaining eight batsmen were disposed of for 53 runs. So England gained an extraordinary win by 10 runs after facing a total of 586, then a record for these Tests, the previous being Australia's 551 at The Oval in 1884. Peel's analysis in the fourth innings was six for 67. Peel also enjoyed a large share in winning the rubber match of that tour. He took seven wickets, scored 73 in a stand for 152 with A. C. MacLaren, and following a grand partnership for 210 by Albert Ward, of Lancashire, and J. T. Brown, of Yorkshire, the two best scorers of England's first innings hit off the runs, the victorious total being 298 for four wickets. In 1896 at Kennington Oval, with conditions very difficult for batsmen, he and J. T. Hearne got rid of Australia for 44. Peel's share in the victory by 66 runs was eight wickets for 53 runs, and his last innings analysis six wickets in 12 overs for 23 runs -- some revenge for getting a pair. Hearne's figures showed ten wickets for 60. That was the last match in which W. G. Grace led England to success over Australia."", ""Besides his great achievements as a bowler, Peel scored over 11,000 runs for Yorkshire, hitting two centuries. His highest innings was 226 not out against Leicestershire in 1892, and four years later he obtained 210 not out in a Yorkshire score of 887 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, a total which remains a county match record. Peel and Lord Hawke, who added 292 for the eighth wicket, F. S. Jackson and E. Wainwright all reached three figures in that innings -- then a record, four centuries in an innings. In 1889, the year in which the over was increased from four balls to five,  Peel put together 158 in the Yorkshire second innings at  Lord's, but yet was on the losing side, a brilliant 100 not out in eighty minutes by T. C. O'Brien taking Middlesex to victory by four wickets with ten minutes to spare. Yielding 1,295 runs for thirty-six wickets, the game produced a record aggregate for a match in England at the time."", ' Peel went four times to Australia, in 1884-85, 1887-88, 1891-92 and 1894-95, and in Test matches with Australia he took 102 wickets for less than 17 runs each. He also figured in Players teams against the Gentlemen from 1887 to 1897, taking in those games 48 wickets at a cost of 16 runs apiece.', ""He scored 1,206 runs and took 128 wickets in all matches in 1896, the year before his remarkable career came to an end. Sent off the field by Lord Hawke during a game at Bramall Lane and suspended for the remainder of the 1897 season, he was not seen again in the Yorkshire team. He did, however, appear for an England XI against Joe Darling's Australian side at Truro two years later, taking five wickets. His benefit match at Bradford in 1894 realised £2,000.\n"", '\nPeel is possibly best remembered for being the man who in 1897 was banned from playing for Yorkshire by Lord Hawke after supposedly urinating on the pitch during a Championship game against Lancashire.  That rumour is generally considered to have been an exageration, but what is beyond doubt is that he had drunk too much.  The Almanack in 1942 wasn\'t up to mentioning such vulgar events.

A tall man with a beautifully easy run-up and a high action, which gave him a particularly awkward flight, he bowled leg-breaks and googlies, and in an age of fine leg-spinners he was, for a while, the equal of any. \n', ""The start of his career was unusual. Coming south from Scotland in the hope of getting a chance in the cricket world, he was engaged as Secretary at the Aubrey Faulkner School of Cricket and so impressed Faulkner himself (to whose coaching he always acknowledged a great debt) and also Sir Pelham Warner that, when difficulty was found in raising a good enough Gentlemen's side against the Players at the Oval in 1927, he was given a place. On this occasion he bowled Sandham, but that was his only wicket; nor was he more successful later in the season at the Folkestone and Scarborough Festivals. However that winter he was sent with the MCC side to South Africa: ostensibly he went as secretary to the captain, but he bowled well enough to secure a place in the first four Tests and, without doing anything spectacular, made it clear that his possibilities had not been overestimated. In 1928 he played a few matches for Middlesex, but it was in 1929 that he really came to the fore, taking 120 wickets at just under 20 runs each and being one of three amateurs to take 100 wickets for the country that season - a unique performance. In 1930 he was up at Oxford, for whom he took 70 wickets, thirteen of them against Cambridge; then, after taking six wickets (including Hobbs, Sutcliffe and Leyland) for 105 for the Gentlemen v the Players, he was picked for the forth Test at Old Trafford. Here, as soon as Peebles came on, Woodfull, who was well set, became acutely uncomfortable, on one occasion leaving a ball which just went over his middle stump; Bradman, coming in, was all but bowled first ball by Peebles, who then had him dropped in the slips and finally caught at slip for 14. The first three balls Kippax received from Peebles produced three confident but unsuccessful appeals for l. b. w.. For such bowling three for 150 was a wholly inadequate reward. In the final Test at the Oval six for 204 may not look much, but in an Australian total of 695 it was better than anyone else. That winter Peebles went again with MCC to South Africa and both there and against New Zealand in the following summer he was one of the most effective bowlers. Already, though, the amount of bowling he had had to do in matches, followed by countless hours in the nets in winter, was affecting him: his leg-break was losing its venom, he was becoming increasingly dependent upon his googly, and his great days were passing, though he was picked for the last Test in 1934, an invitation which he had to refuse owing to injury. When, after several seasons of intermittent appearances, he returned to regular county cricket in 1939 to captain Middlesex, Peebles was really no more than a change bowler, and though he played occasionally until 1948, the loss of an eye in a war-time air-raid had, to all intents and purposes, ended his serious cricket career."", 'After his playing day were over he entered the wine trade and also became a notable cricket writer and journalist. When writing of players he had played with or seen, he was in the top class; to a deep knowledge of the game he added rare charm and humour.

From the time that F. S. Jackson at Lord's by his remarkable allround success helped Harrow gain a victory over Eton by 156 runs in 1888, he went on from strength to strength, until he became one of the finest cricketers ever seen in England. Unfortunately he could not go on any tour to Australia owing to business reasons, and the presence of Lord Hawke in command of Yorkshire until 1910 prevented him from ever being the county captain, though he was occasionally in charge of the side. He reached the zenith of his fame in  1905 when captain of England against Australia. In all five Tests he won the toss; made 492 runs with an average of 70, among his scores being 144 not out at Leeds, 113 at  Manchester, 82 not out at Nottingham, 76 and 31 at The Oval; took 13 wickets at 15.46 each, surpassing the efforts of all his colleagues and opponents. Of the five contests,  England won that at Nottingham by 213 runs --- after declaring with five men out --- and that at Manchester by an innings and 80 runs, while they held much the stronger position in each of the three matches left unfinished. By a curious coincidence Stanley Jackson and Joseph Darling, then the Australian captain, were exactly the same age, both having been born on November 21, 1870. That was  Darling's third visit as captain and his last tour in  England. He died on January 2, 1946, and his obituary in last year's "", ' contains some of his experiences in opposition to Jackson. \n', ""Regarding his luck in winning the toss in those 1905 Tests and as captain of  M.C.C., for whom he scored 85 in a rain-ruined match at  Lord's, Jackson said that at Scarborough, when captain for the seventh time against the Australians: I found Darling stripped to the waist. He said, `Now we'll have a proper tossing, and he who gets on top wins the toss.' So I said to George Hirst, `Georgie, you come and toss this time.' Darling then said, `All right, we'll toss in the old-fashioned way!' Again winning the toss, Jackson scored 123 and 31 not out, rain preventing a definite result."", ""Born at Chapel Allerton, near Leeds, Stanley Jackson showed remarkable batting ability when at a preparatory school before he went to Harrow, when he was in the eleven for three years, being captain in 1889. He did little on the first occasion, and his father, then the Rt. Hon. W. L. Jackson, a member of the Cabinet in Lord Salisbury's second Government, promised Stanley a sovereign for each wicket he took and a shilling for each run he made. Stanley scored 21 and 59 and took eleven wickets for 68 runs; Harrow won by 156 runs. His father's generosity over cricket ceased with that match. Stanley's only comment was that he was glad he had come off, as it would do father so much good."", 'Next year, when captain, five wickets fell to him, and his vigorous 68, best score in the match, accounted largely for victory by nine wickets. Proceeding to Cambridge, Jackson gained his Blue as a Freshman, and in 1892 he headed both the batting and bowling averages, and in first-class matches came out third among the amateur bowlers with 80 wickets for less than 19 runs apiece.', ""Re-elected captain, he led Cambridge to victory by 266 runs in 1893, showing such convincing form that he was given a place in the England team for the  First Test at Lord's. He followed a splendid innings of 91 with 103 at The Oval, but when, late in August, the time came for the third Test --- at Manchester --- he and other Yorkshiremen who might have been included in the side turned out for their county against Sussex at Brighton. He was one of five Allrounders given prominence in 1894 "", '.', ""Describing his first Test innings of 91 in 1893 at Lord's, Sir Stanley smiled and then related that, in the second Test at The Oval, W. G. Grace, the  England captain, said, With all these batsmen I don't know where to put you. Anywhere will do. Then number seven. Thanks. That's my lucky number; I was the seventh child. And that match brought my first hundred for England. Mold came in last when I was 99. He nearly ran me out, so in desperation I jumped in and drove Giffen high to the seats, reaching 103. Then the bewildered Mold did run me out."", '(There were five daughters besides the elder son, children of the first Lord Allerton. Stanley Jackson married in 1902 Julia, daughter of Henry Broadley Harrison-Broadley, then M.P. for Howdenshire. Their son, Henry Stanley Lawies, married in 1927 Grace Diana, daughter of Dr. Arthur Phillip Beddard.)', ""Jackson figured in all the 1896 Test matches, also in the next visit of Australia when the rubber was extended to five fixtures, being credited with 118 at The Oval in 1899. In the great games of 1902 Jackson was England's best batsman. He did little at Sheffield, but at Birmingham, when three wickets fell for 35, he scored 53 and with J. T. Tyldesley saved England from collapse. At Lord's Fry and Ranjitsinhji were dismissed without a run, but Jackson and A. C. MacLaren, contemporaries at Harrow, raised the total to 102 without being separated before rain washed out the match. In the memorable Manchester struggle, which Australia won by three runs, five England wickets went down for 44 in reply to a total of 299, but Jackson and Braund pulled the game round with a partnership of 141, Jackson himself going on to make 128. At dinner in the evening of that great day a lady sitting next to him said, I was so disappointed that Ranjitsinhji failed --- and this remark was made to the man who had played the innings of his life. He was fond of telling this little yarn against himself. At The Oval Jackson scored 49, sharing in a partnership of 109 with G. L. Jessop, whose wonderful innings of 104 paved the way to  England's one-wicket victory. Altogether Jackson scored 1,415 runs in Test matches against Australia --- all in this country --- with an average of nearly 49, and took 24 wickets at an average of 33."", 'Jackson played first for Yorkshire in 1890, and his last appearance for the side was in 1907. During that period he scored 10,405 runs for the county, averaging nearly 34 an innings, and dismissed 506 batsman for 19 runs apiece. In 1898, the only season when he appeared regularly for his county, he scored 1,566 runs and took 104 wickets. His highest scores for Yorkshire were 160 against Gloucestershire, 158 against Surrey, and 155 against Middlesex. He appeared on many occasions for  Gentlemen against Players, and in those games made a thousand runs, average 31.50, and took fifty wickets. His aggregate for all first-class matches was 16,251 runs, average 33, and 834 wickets at 19 runs each.', ""Among his bowling triumphs were eight Lancashire wickets at  Sheffield in 1902 for 13 runs, and the last four Australian wickets in five balls at Leeds in the same year, his analysis being five wickets for 12; he and George Hirst dismissed the Australians for 23. This happened directly after England in a drawn Test match had disposed of  Australia for 36; Rhodes, who took seven wickets for 17, did not bowl in the more remarkable collapse of the  Australians for the second lowest total ever recorded by an Australian side in England. When in 1896 Harry Trott's team fell for 18 before M.C.C. at Lord's, Jackson scored 51 on a treacherous pitch. In the Gentlemen and Players match at  Lord's in 1894 he and S. M. J. Woods bowled unchanged. Jackson took 12 wickets for 77 and, in addition, made 63 --- the highest score of the match, which the Gentlemen won by an innings and 37 runs before four o'clock on the second day."", ""Going to India with Lord Hawke's team in the winter of 1892-93, Jackson took 69 wickets at 10.27 runs apiece and tied for first place in the batting averages with A. J. L. Hill, a Cambridge contemporary. When again captain of the Light Blues in 1893, Jackson gave Ranjitsinhji his Blue. At Lord's he instructed C. M. Wells to bowl wides in order to prevent Oxford from getting a desired follow-on, and Cambridge won by 266 runs. This set an example followed by Frank Mitchell three years later, when Oxford won by four wickets, and so primarily led to an alteration in the laws, making the follow-on an optional choice for the side holding the upper hand."", 'President of the Marylebone Club in 1921, the highest honour that a cricketer can enjoy, Sir Stanley Jackson was chairman of Test Match Selection Committee in 1934, and in 1943 presided over the special committee appointed by  M.C.C. to consider Post-war Cricket.', ""Well-built and standing nearly six feet high, Stanley Jackson was equipped with special physical advantages for cricket; to these were added fine judgment, perseverance, and, above all, exceptional courage which amounted to belief in his own abilities. Free and stylish in method, he drove splendidly on either side of the wicket and was perhaps the finest forcing on-side batsman of his time. While essentially a forward player on hard wickets, he had at his command on sticky wickets a strength and science of back play to which few men have attained. His great stroke sent a good-length ball through the covers; he cut square or late and turned the ball cleverly on the leg side with similar precision. Nothing was better than the way he jumped in and drove the ball over the bowler's head, as shown in the life-like picture at Lord's, and as I saw at Bradford, where he sent the ball high over the football stand."", 'A right-handed rather fast-medium bowler with a nice easy action and plenty of spin, he kept a good length and often got on a sharp off-break. On a difficult wicket he was a bowler who might dispose of any side. While always a keen and smart field, especially at cover-point, he was not in his early days a sure catch, but steadily improved in this respect and made himself in every sense a great player.', ""At Bradford on one occasion he was out to a brilliant catch in the long field, whereupon he tucked his bat under his arm and joined vigorously in the applause which greeted the fieldsman's splendid effort."", ""On the same ground, where there is a stone wall in front of the pavilion, a ball bowled by Jackson was sent by a low skimming drive with such force that it rolled back from the wall into the middle of the field, coming to rest practically at the bowler's feet. Jackson, in appreciation of the remarkable occurrence, made the ball a dignified bow."", 'In the South African War Jackson served with the Royal Lancaster Regiment of Militia, and in the first Great War, 1914-18, he was Lieutenant-Colonel of a West Yorkshire Regiment battalion which he raised and commanded. He entered Parliament in 1915 and remained Unionist member for Howdenshire Division of Yorkshire until 1926. One day in the House of Commons dining room Mr. Winston Churchill, who had been his fag at Harrow, said, Let me introduce you to Mr. Lloyd George. There came a quick exclamation, I have been looking all my life for the man who gave Winston Churchill a hiding at school.', ""When he wanted to make his maiden speech the debate went unfavourably, and he received a note from the Speaker: I have dropped you in the batting order; it's sticky wicket. Then, at a better opportunity, he sent this hint: Get your pads on; you're next in."", 'In 1922 he was appointed Financial Secretary to the War Office, and next year he succeeded Lord Younger as Chairman of the Unionist Party Organisation. In 1927 he went out to India as Governor of Bengal. There he proved equal to the most trying situation, behaving with splendid nerve and authority when he nearly fell a victim to attempted assassination by a Calcutta girl student who fired five shots at close range, narrowly missing Sir Stanley when presiding at a meeting. His London home was bombed in 1940, and in August 1946 he was run over by a taxi, receiving a severe injury to his right leg: a climax to unpleasant experiences which no doubt contributed to his last illness and hastened the end of this very distinguished Englishman.  H. P.', 'In ', ', 1932,  Lord Hawke, in an article -- Fifty Years of Yorkshire County -- wrote:--', ""Our greatest amateur was undoubtedly Stanley Jackson, who was `Jacker' to everyone from his Harrow days. He was a great batsman, great bowler, fine fielder -- a great cricketer to the core. Few who remember him as a batsman know that he was once No. 10 in the batting order for Yorkshire! This is how it happened. Though he had just taken seven for 42 against Middlesex, somebody had run him out for a song and he did not seem keen to play in the next match at Chesterfield."", ""`Why,' I argued with him, `you've just got seven of 'em out at six apiece! You must come.' So he came all right. Next day as I was writing out the order I asked him where he'd like to go in, so he said, `Oh, don't know. Treat me as a bowler.' So I wrote him down No. 10.  Brown and Tunnicliffe then proceeded to make 554 for the first wicket. I was No. 3 that day in Jackson's place. As they walked out to bat I put on my pads. I took them off for the lunch interval; I put them on again and took them off again for the tea interval. Again I put them on, and sat another couple of hours. Such is cricket!"", ""I have never seen `Jacker's' equal at bowling for his field. I remember one occasion when we were `in the cart' at Bradford against Surrey how precisely he bowled for his field, and how he apologised to me for having bowled a ball not intended. Though his grand batting for England is probably best remembered, he was a bowler of the very highest class, with a graceful, flowing delivery of a kind but rarely seen nowadays."", ""Since those happy days `Jacker' has passed through more serious times in Bengal. There, a couple of years ago, he and I were the guests of honour at the dinner to us of the Calcutta Cricket Club given at the Bengal Club. We both made speeches, and when he got up to speak first he said across the table to me, `I've got first innings today, old man. You bossed me often enough in the past, but I'm boss here!'"", 'Sir Pelham Warner, in a letter to ', ', wrote:--', ""I had known Sir Stanley Jackson since 1889, when Harrow met Rugby at Althorp Park. On that evening began a friendship which grew with the years, and which I prized greatly. `He was my friend, faithful and just to me,' and though we all have to face the Pale Horseman there is no need to be afraid of him, and I am certain Sir Stanley faced him with the same calm courage as he showed in the great matches of his day. He was a splendid allround cricketer -- one of the finest in the history of cricket -- and never was he finer than in a crisis; it was a stirring sight to see him come down the pavilion steps to set right any early failures there may have been; immaculate in his flannels and his beautifully cleaned pads and boots, with his neat trim figure every inch a cricketer. No English cricketer had a finer record in England against Australia. And then, when he gave up, he sat on the Woolsack of Cricket, as President of the  M.C.C., and at the time of his death he was a trustee of  Lord's, chairman of the Cricket Committee, and president of the Yorkshire C.C.C. To the end he took the greatest possible interest in M.C.C. Never a week passed, even during the winter, that he was not at Lord's, and in the summer he was the best known of all the men who delight in the charm and atmosphere of the famous ground. He was busy with every avenue and aspect of the game and his enthusiasm never flagged. That he had been seriously ill for some time was obvious, but only a few days before he died he telephoned asking me to come to see him. I found him in good spirits, saying that he felt so much better that he had good hopes of coming to Lord's for a committee meeting."", ""As a batsman he was soundness itself, with all the strokes -- what I call a `complete' batsman. His style was easy and natural and he inspired confidence. Bowling medium pace, with a beautifully easy action, he kept a length. At cover point, his usual position, he was not a Hobbs or a Jessop, but active and quick, missing few chances. In a gallery of great players it is impossible to have a fixed order of merit, but he was in the first class of an honours school of cricket both as a batsman and an allrounder. When you have known and been very fond of a man for nearly sixty years it is not easy to write exactly what you feel about him, but this I will say, that his manner was always easy and pleasant, and in the cricket world, by young and old alike, he was welcomed, appreciated and respected. His absence leaves a big void."", 'Wilfred Rhodes, now 70 years of age, wrote:--', ""In paying a modest tribute to the late Sir Stanley Jackson it is difficult for me to find words that would express my appreciation of such a great cricketer with so fine a personality. From 1898 to the close of his first-class cricket career I was fortunate to play on the same side for Yorkshire and under his captaincy several times for  England, chiefly in Tests against Australia, and had a great admiration for his ability. He was one of England's greatest captains and played many splendid innings during this period. It was a pity he never toured Australia, as I think he would have been very successful with his style of play on their fast wickets."", 'A model allround cricketer if ever there was one, he was immaculately dressed, flannels always neat and trim even at the end of a long innings, and whether batting, bowling or in the field, his movements were stylish and graceful. He was a great batsman and possessed the gift of a fine temperament, with plenty of confidence and pluck, and always appeared at his best on great occasions, especially when fighting with his back to the wall. Many times he pulled the game around for  England and helped to put them on the way to victory. His batting was stylish, orthodox and very copy-book, with strokes all round the wicket, and particularly strong to the off.', ""As a bowler he used spin and variation of pace with a clever slow one. On one occasion, when bowling to G. L. Jessop at Cambridge, he sent up his slower ball, which was hit out of the field over the trees. Schofield Haigh, fielding mid-on, was laughing, and F.S., turning round, said to him, `What are you laughing at?' Haigh replied, `Your slow ball, sir.' F. S.: `It was a good one, wasn't it?'"", ""George Hirst, the famous Yorkshire cricketer, now in his 77th year, wrote at the time of Sir Stanley's death:--"", 'I am deeply grieved to learn of the death of my friend and colleague. He was one of the most graceful of all cricketers, whether he was batting, bowling or fielding, and he was a perfect gentleman in everything he did, both on and off the field.', 'In him young cricketers had a perfect model. Many are the times I have seen him with a beautifully rolled umbrella in his hand demonstrating strokes to schoolboys. He loved to help the youngsters, and that was possibly why he was always so keenly interested in my work as coach to the county club. I have indeed lost a good friend.', 'Mr. H. D. G. Leveson Gower said: As a Test Match player Sir Stanley never has been excelled in temperament or skill. I served with him on many M.C.C. committees, and his views on the game always commanded attention. I played against him for Oxford in the Varsity match of 1893, and consider the Cambridge eleven he captained one of the most powerful to represent that University. His name will always live in the annals of cricket, the game he adorned.', 'Mr. Stanley Christopherson, President of M.C.C. for several years until 1946: I held the greatest admiration for Sir Stanley both as a cricketer and for his great work for the game; he was most painstaking and did splendid work on many committees and as a selector.', ""Mr. T. L. Taylor, an old Cambridge Blue who was elected the new president of Yorkshire in the autumn, a contemporary player with Sir Stanley, described his death as a very serious loss to county and international cricket and the game in general, and said:  He was one of Yorkshire's greatest allrounders, and one of  England's most redoubtable Test captains."", 'The King was represented by Lord Chorley at the London memorial service for Sir Stanley Jackson. Canon F. H. Gillingham, the former Essex cricketer, who conducted the service, said:--', 'The first time I ever played with him I was impressed with his strength of character and control. He always seemed to have that extra reserve of strength to compete with any cricket crisis, however severe.', 'He was the most honest man I ever met -- in fact he was too honest. I never heard him say an unkind word about anyone, and he always had excuses for anyone who spoke an unkind word to him.', 'So we say farewell to a great English gentleman, but we will retain with us for ever the remembrance of all that he meant to us and to the country he served so well.\n']","['Later Rt.

This in itself would entitle him to a place among the great, but his figures become even more remarkable if his innings are analysed. In three of these matches he came to the rescue at a grave crisis. On the first occasion, the third Test in 1932-33, he came in at 186 for 5, not a good score by the standards of Tests in Australia in those days, and made 77, adding 96 with Verity for the eighth wicket. In the fourth Test at Brisbane, he was taken to hospital with tonsillitis and doubtless, had all gone well with England, would not have batted. But all did not go well, and at 216 for 6 he emerged from the pavilion, refused Woodfull's offer of a runner, was still there at the close, and returned to bed in hospital. Next morning, he was not out until he had scored 83 in nearly four hours. On this occasion he and Verity put on 92 for the ninth wicket. Normally quick on his feet and a fine driver, he had conserved energy by waiting for opportunities to hit the ball to leg, preferably to the boundary. Few innings in history have so captivated the imagination of the public. Moreover, Paynter insisted on fielding for a couple of hours before retiring and then, as if to show that he was none the worse, in a brief second innings he finished the match with a 6. \n"", ""In 1938 at Lord's, he came in a 31 for 3 and helped Hammond in a stand of 222, of which his own share was 99. In the previous Test at Nottingham he had broken the record for England against Australia in this country with an innings of 216 not out. In all Tests, Paynter's average was 59.23. In the series in South Africa in 1938-39 he averaged 81.62 scoring a hundred in each innings of the first Test, and 243 in the third. Yet Paynter was 24 when he first made a hundred for Lancashire II, and between 1926 and 1929 he appeared only 11 times for the county without any success. It was not until 1931, when he was 30, that he made his first century against Warwickshire at Old Trafford, gained a regular place, and reached his thousand runs. In 1932 he was inconsistent, but on the strength of some notable innings was selected for the MCC side to Australia. He had been picked for the third Test against New Zealand in 1931 but scored only 3."", 'It was four years after the 1932-33 tour before Paynter played for England again. Meanwhile, he had made plenty of runs for Lancashire, and in 1936 actually scored 964 runs in August; unfortunately the side for Australia had already been picked. In 1937, however, he could be denied no longer. He scored 2,904 runs with an average of 53.77, including 322 in five hours against Sussex at Hove, and 266 against Essex at Old Trafford, and played in two Tests against New Zealand, missing the third because of injury. Two years later the war virtually ended his career. He resisted pressure to return to the county side at 45, but in 1947, in a couple of festival matches at Harrogate, played innings of 154, 73, and 127, the last taking only eighty-five minutes.', ""A small man, Paynter was by instinct an attacking batsman, particularly effective against slow spin, but also a fine hooker and cutter who did not spare the fast bowler if he pitched short. He was one of the great outfields of his day and almost equally good at cover - a beautiful thrower with a safe pair of hands. This was the more remarkable as early in life he had lost the top joints of two fingers in an accident. At Lord's in 1938, when Ames had broken a finger, Paynter kept wicket through the Australian second innings of 204, and though he had little or no experience of wicketkeeping conceded only 5 byes and held a catch.

Graeme Swann made his England debut as a raw 20-year-old in 2000, in a nondescript one-day international in Bloemfontein, but it was a brief foray into the top level. Eight years later, having learnt his trade on the county scene with Northamptonshire and then Nottinghamshire, his Test debut came against India, at Chennai, and from that point he never looked back, becoming one of England's greatest spinners. \n"", ""In 60 Tests, he took 255 wickets at a touch under 30 runs apiece in a little more than five years, prolific wicket-taking exceeding anyone else in Test cricket in that period, with James  Anderson (232), Stuart Broad (207) and Dale Steyn (205) behind him. He retired as England's sixth highest wicket-taker, the leading offspinner and second among all England slow bowlers only to Derek Underwood, who took 297 wickets. He was wonderfully adaptable: attuned when necessary to a defensive role to allow the quicks in England's four-strong attack time to rest, and also blessed with the ability to dip and turn the ball markedly. He was also one of England's great character cricketers, refreshingly individualistic on and off the field, bringing fun wherever he played. He was a fine slip fielder, too, although the hours spent in the field, and the training grind necessary to achieve peak physical fitness, did not always some naturally to him."", ""As the new millennium dawned, there was a fear that traditional offspinners were becoming defunct at the highest level. Swann was one of a special band who challenged the notion. He did not have a doosra, but he had cunning, flight and turn. He was also helped by a striking number of left-handed batsmen at the highest levels and a growing use of technology which made it more likely that umpires would uphold lbw appeals. Of his 255 wickets, 70 were lbw, compared to Laker's 32 from 193; 121 of his victims were left-handers whereas Laker only returned 32. When he retired, he felt irreplaceable."", ""His debut at Chennai was marked by two wickets in his first over - the knack of striking in his first over would be a skill that stayed with him - and within a few months he had usurped Monty Panesar as England's premier spinner, a position he would not relinquish. Swann loved a wise-crack (his 2010-11 Ashes video diary became an internet hit) - a trait that did not endear him to all early in his career - but it would be unfair merely to brand him as a dressing-room joker. He was the ultimate competitor on the field, often bordering on feisty, and a master of his craft. His record showed the value of developing at domestic level and the fact he was pulled out of the international game as a youngster, almost as quickly as he was handed his chance, with the severe England coach at the time, Duncan Fletcher, not alone in regarding him as somewhat immature, perhaps saved him from being overwhelmed before he was ready."", ""After biding his time on the domestic circuit, he soon became a matchwinner at Test level and a key part of both the one-day side and Twenty20 sides. After a successful tour of West Indies (albeit in a losing cause) he played a key role in the 2009 Ashes victories at Lord's and The Oval. Further incisive spells followed over the years to come: South Africa in Durban, Bangladesh in Chittagong, Pakistan at Edgbaston and Lord's, Australia in Adelaide, Sri Lanka in Cardiff, India at The Oval, Sri Lanka in Colombo."", ""During the 2012 home season, Swann's career hit a blip. The snap and spark in his bowling disappeared for a time as he was superbly played by Hashim Amla. For only the second time in his Test career he was dropped: the Test at Headingley became infamous for a text-message furore which engulfed Kevin Pietersen. However, the following winter Swann was back to being a central figure, helping England to an historic series win in India, his alliance with Monty Panesar as they claimed 19 of the 20 wickets to fall representing one of the greatest spin-bowling double acts in England's Test history. "", ' dubbed them ""the dust devils"".', ""A recurrence of a long-standing elbow problem, which he has been forced to manage throughout his career, meant he required surgery in early 2013 and England were forced to contemplate life without Swann. He was back for that summer's Ashes, and took 26 wickets without ever being at his best, but he would not last the return series in Australia. The third Test in Perth proved to be his last. The last ball bowled he bowled in Test cricket flew deep into the Prindiville Stand at wide long-on; his final over went for 22, all to the whirring blade of Shane Watson. Seven wickets at 80 in the series, as he failed to get enough revolutions on the ball to remain a threat, represented an unhappy end."", 'With the Ashes lost after three Tests, Swann announced his retirement four days before the Boxing Day Test.  A tour which had started with such promise for England was by then in disarray: Jonathan Trott, the long-serving No 3, had already departed with a stress-related illness.

His technical talent matched his character and his achievements were therefore on the highest plane. \n', ""In a career extending from 1919 to 1939 Herbert Sutcliffe scored more than 50,000 runs and averaged 52. He never knew a season of failure, except by the standard of his own astonishing peaks, and at the zenith of his career he scored 16,255 runs in five years as a measure of mastery in all conditions and over the world's best bowling of the time."", ""The First World War delayed his entry into county cricket until he was 24 years old when, after demobilisation from a commission in the Green Howards, he was given a place in the Yorkshire side. His quality was never in doubt and by the end of the 1919 season he had scored five centuries in an aggregate of 1,839 runs. He had also established a first-wicket partnership with Percy Holmes. For fourteen years these two batsmen opened the innings for Yorkshire, representing a partnership of unparalleled success in which they put up the hundred on 74 occasions. Equally happy was Sutcliffe's Test match association with J. B. Hobbs, for this became the most accomplished of all opening partnerships. Sutcliffe's good fortune, however, was only in the presentation of opportunity. Seizure of it was his own merit and with one partner or another he constructed 145 first-wicket century stands."", 'His artistry and efficiency in difficult conditions became legendary in his lifetime, with his centuries against Australia at The Oval in 1926 and at  Melbourne in 1929 as historic examples. Matches against  Lancashire stirred him to nine centuries. His defensive patience and skill became a byword, yet at need his hitting was brilliant in the extreme. Against Northamptonshire at Kettering he met spin on the sticky wicket with an innings of 113 which included ten 6s. At Scarborough against the fast bowling of Farnes and Nichols, Sutcliffe took his personal score from 100 to 194 in forty minutes. His 100th first-class century was the 132 he hit in less than two hours at Bradford when Yorkshire were hurrying to defeat  Gloucestershire.', 'Courage and concentration were his basic attributes. No prospect daunted him, no difficulty dismayed him, no crisis upset him. He was an artist of the dead bat and an uncompromising hooker of fast bowling. He sought solution to his batting problems by taking them as they came, one at a time. He never allowed the present to be influenced by the alarms of the past or fears for the future. In the means and manner of his performances he raised enormous prestige for himself throughout the cricketing world. He was admired and respected wherever he played and by his refusal to depreciate his own value he raised the status of his profession.', 'He took the supplementary rewards of his distinction with polished grace and unfailing consideration for colleagues. Herbert Sutcliffe the individual always made it clear that he was  Herbert Sutcliffe inseparable from Yorkshire and England. He was as punctilious in acknowledgment of obligations as he was single-minded towards the immediate task in hand.', 'After the retirement of A. W. Lupton in 1927,  Sutcliffe was offered the Yorkshire captaincy as a professional player. Although he was on tour in South Africa when the invitation came he appreciated the possibility of divided opinions and with characteristic diplomacy declined the appointment, giving an insurance of his willingness to play under any captain.', 'During his playing days he founded and developed a sports outfitting business, now directed by his elder son. After his retirement from the field he took a managerial appointment in the paper trade. He showed himself as successful in commerce as in cricket and for the same reasons of application and reliability. His repayment to the game which had given him so much was service on the Yorkshire committee, as an England selector, and as sponsor for many good causes in cricket.', ""Though he was born in Summerbridge, Sutcliffe was a Pudsey native in cricket association. There, as a schoolboy, he began league cricket and from there he advanced to the county, but neither Pudsey nor any other nursery could have claimed Herbert Sutcliffe as a typical product. He was a Yorkshireman in his loyalty and training, but he was cosmopolitan in approach and outlook. His manner fitted Lord's as expressively as it fitted Leeds."", 'Immaculate, alert, brisk of movement, serene in repose, he carried his character with a clear label wherever he appeared. His off-drive wore a silk hat and his hook was a ready response to the aggressive intent of any bumper. His defensive play was the reduction of risk to the minimum and his self-confidence was unshakeable.', 'In his first-class career he scored 149 centuries. He shared with Holmes a partnership of 555 for Yorkshire, and with Hobbs a partnership of 283 for England against  Australia.', 'Second in the nominal batting order,  Herbert Sutcliffe was second to none in steadfastness on all occasions.

With his black patka, wide eyes and eager (if a touch hapless) fielding, he rapidly became a fan favourite.  \n', 'After years of limited and negative England spinners, Panesar was a revelation. His languid action deeply excited England supporters and even on the occasions when sharp turn was not forthcoming that was belied by an effervescence apparent in his cherubic and unconfined celebrations at the fall of each and every wicket. Like a lamb let loose from the paddock, he cut a joyful figure. ', 'For a time, he was considered the saviour of English spin bowling, but that position was usurped by the emergence of his old Northants colleague Graeme Swann, who had greater command of spin and dip on flat surfaces and who also had a shrewdness about him which Panesar occasionally seemed to lack. They combined in spectacular fashion, however, in Mumbai in November 2012, dubbed the ""dust devils"" as they returned joint figures of 19 for 323, in one of the greatest England spin double acts in history, only the fourth occasion that England spinners had combined to take 19 wickets or more wickets in a Test and the first time for 54 years.', ""When Swann retired midway through England's Ashes debacle in 2013-14, debilitated by elbow trouble, Panesar should have been ready to step in. But his career was by then in question. He left Sussex under a cloud in 2013 after urinating from on high upon a nightclub bouncer in the early hours of the morning, and his behaviour on long tours had its eccentric moments. He joined Essex, with his many fans hoping that it would revive a faltering career, but despite respectable returns in his first full season at Chelmsford the rise of Moeen Ali looked to have consigned his England days to the past."", ""A Luton lad by birth he progressed through Northamptonshire's youth teams and was picked for England Under-19s in 2000. He marked his first-class debut a year later against Leicestershire with a match haul of 8 for 131. Opportunities thereafter were limited but a fine 2005 season kick-started his career. He took 46 Championship wickets at 21.54, and spent part of the winter at the Darren Lehmann Academy in Adelaide. That was enough for Panesar to be picked for England's 2006 tour of India in February. He made his Test debut at Nagpur picking up his boyhood hero, Sachin Tendulkar, as his first Test wicket and Rahul Dravid as his third."", ""The following summer, against Pakistan, Panesar attracted national headlines, even beyond the game, by spinning England to a series win. At Old Trafford he made the most of a helpful surface with eight wickets then, at Headingley, he was England's best bowler on a run-filled strip. The loop, guile and changes of pace outfoxed Pakistan's top-order, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf and Younis Khan."", ""In a matter of months he had elevated himself to the position of England's senior spinner, pushing aside Ashley Giles. Yet Duncan Fletcher - ever the loyalist, rarely the risk-taker - preferred a rusty Giles for the first two Tests of the 2006-07 Ashes. England were thrashed in both but Monty got a chance in the third at Perth, becoming the first English spinner to take five at the WACA (and eight in the match). As England crashed to a humiliating 5-0 defeat, Panesar was one of the precious few to return home with their reputation intact."", ""He started the 2007 summer with 23 wickets in four Tests against West Indies, which brought a career-high No. 6 ranking, but things began to go awry thereafter. He struggled in the following home series against India, and away in Sri Lanka, where he lost his confidence and misunderstood mutterings began about his lack of variety. Though he fared well in New Zealand a tough 2008 summer, where Graeme Smith swept him to distraction in South Africa's series-clinching win in Edgbaston, blunted his cheerful persona. "", ""He was comprehensively outperformed by a resurgent Swann during his return to India in December 2008, and again in the Caribbean, where he lost his position as England's No. 1 spinner. The bowling lacked spark but more significantly, so did the man. Lost in a confusion of 'expert' opinion around him, he lost faith in his method. That trend continued in the first Test of the 2009 Ashes at Cardiff, where he and Swann both underperformed with the ball, claiming one wicket between them. However, by batting through to the close in a remarkable tenth-wicket stand with James Anderson, Panesar reaffirmed his cult status. That was as good as the summer got for him though as his bowling form slumped and he lost his central contract. "", ""By the end of 2009 the future of Panesar's international career looked doubtful but he took control by leaving his life-long county Northamptonshire and moving to Sussex. Trusted to set his fields and take a senior role in the dressing room he rediscovered his vim. A strong 2010 season saw a return to the England squad for the Ashes win. On the 2012 winter tour to UAE he finally got his chance for England again, picking up 14 wickets at 22 from his two Tests against Pakistan, but opportunities continued to be sporadic."", 'There followed a disturbing deterioration in both his professional and personal life. He was released by Sussex late in the 2013 season after urinating on high on a Brighton nightclub bouncer after he had been asked to leave. After a loan spell at Northants, it was Essex who gambled on him, but his form remained unconvincing and there were reports of unpredictable and difficult behaviour as he was left out of the side for long periods. By the time Essex also let him go, in September 2015, he had taken 67 wickets in 24 first-class games (all in Division Two) at 28.62 and  was back with his long-time mentor, Neil Burns, following a holistic approach to his career which emphasised personal and mental welfare alongside cricketing skills. It brought him a couple of matches for Northants in 2016 but no sign of regular cricket.\n', '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2001'],50.0,68,23,220.0,26,4.88,749,29.37,0,0,23,1,10.0,0.0,26.0,8,3,26.0,13,5.2,91,28.57,0,0,2,0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1.0,1,1.00,2,50.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,219.0,270,87,1536,46*,8.39,4315,35.59,0,0,,,44,0,85.0,29,13,141,17*,8.81,251,56.17,0,0,,,15,0,33.0,7,2,7,3*,1.40,15,46.66,0,0,0,0,3,0,50.0,85,12475,5797,167.0,6/37,11/210,34.71,2.78,74.7,4,12,2,26.0,26,1308,980,24.0,3/25,3/25,40.83,4.49,54.5,0,0,0,1.0,1,24,40,2.0,2/40,2/40,20.00,10.0,12.0,0,0,0,219.0,,48193,22135,709,7/60,,31.22,2.75,67.9,26,39,6,85.0,,3725,2892,83,5/20,5/20,34.84,4.65,44.8,0,1,0,33.0,32,648,816,27,3/14,3/14,30.22,7.55,24.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

One of the greatest and assuredly one of the most popular players of his time, he helped to get rid of 1,493 batsmen, 71 of them in Test matches, and he established another world record which still stands by holding 1,235 catches. His stumpings numbered 258. He set up a third record in 1903 when taking 71 catches and bringing off 20 stumpings, but Fred Huish, of Kent, surpassed this eight years later. \n', 'Strudwick figured regularly behind the stumps for Surrey for 25 years and, becoming scorer afterwards, served the county altogether for 60 years. He played 28 times for England between 1911 and 1926 during the period when Australia and  South Africa were their only Test match opponents and would doubtless have been chosen more often had he not been contemporary with A. A. Lilley, of Warwickshire, a better batsman. Four times he toured Australia, in 1903-04, 1911-12, 1920-21 and 1924-25 and visited South Africa with M.C.C. in 1909-10 and 1913-14. In addition, he was a frequent member of Players teams against Gentlemen. For  England at Johannesburg in 1913-14, he dismissed seven South African batsmen in the match. His best performance in a single innings was six catches against Sussex at The Oval in 1904 and in a match eight victims (seven caught, one  stumped) against Essex at Leyton in 1904.', 'No more genuine sportsman, in every sense of the word, than the teetotal, non-smoking Strudwick ever took the field for Surrey. An idol of the Surrey crowd, he was always ready to proffer helpful advice to young players. He never appealed unless sure in his own mind that a batsman was out, and such was his keenness to save runs that he was frequently known to chase a ball to the boundary. Sir H. D. G. Leveson Gower, the former Oxford, Surrey and England captain, once wrote: When you walk on to a certain cricket ground and you find Strudwick behind the wicket, you feel that you will not only get full value for your money, but you will participate in the cheerfulness that his presence always lends to the day.', 'In an article, From Dr. Grace to Peter May, in the 1959 ', ', hailed by the critics as one of the best published by ', "" for many years, Struddy, as he was affectionately known throughout the cricket world, described how hard was life as a professional cricketer in his young days. Then, one dare not stand down because of injury for fear of losing a place in the side and consequent loss of pay. Compared with that of today, the equipment of wicketkeepers was flimsy and the men behind the stumps took a lot of punishment, especially as, on the far from perfect pitches, it was difficult to gauge how the ball would come through. The article mentioned that F. Stedman, Strudwick's predecessor in the Surrey side, habitually protected his chest with a South Western Railway time-table stuffed into his shirt, and on one occasion, after receiving a more than usually heavy blow, he remarked to a nearby team-mate: I shall have to catch a later train tonight. That one knocked off the 7-30!"", ""It is of interest to note that a lady set Struddy on the path to becoming the world's most celebrated wicketkeeper. As a choir-boy at Mitcham, his birth-place, he took part in matches under the supervision of the daughter of the vicar, a Miss Wilson. Then about 10 years old, Strudwick habitually ran in from cover to the wicket to take returns from the field. Observing how efficiently he did this, Miss Wilson once said:  You ought to be a wicketkeeper. From that point, Strudwick became one."", ""Not in the ordinary way regarded as much of a batsman, he hit 93 in ninety minutes, easily his largest innings, against Essex at The Oval in 1913, when he and H. S. Harrison shared an eighth-wicket partnership of 134. In the Second Test Match at Melbourne during the Australian tour of J. W. H. T. Douglas's 1920-21 team, he distinguished himself with innings of 21 not out and 24."", 'Honours bestowed upon Struddy included honorary membership of M.C.C. in 1949 and life membership of Surrey, whose oil-paintings of celebrities in the Long Room at The Oval include one of him.', ', under whose captaincy he played in Australia: Not only was he a magnificent wicketkeeper, but he set a fine example to the rest of the side, always being first to be ready to play. He was 100 per cent in every way.', ', Yorkshire and England: Struddy was above all a wonderful man and a great player. I telephoned him just before his 90th birthday and we had a long chat over old days. I went with him on his first M.C.C. tour to Australia in 1903-04 and then to South Africa. We were great friends.', ', M.C.C. Secretary and a former England wicketkeeper: This wonderful man and great cricketer taught me, when 14, all I ever knew about wicketkeeping at the cricket school he helped to run in South London.

5 ft 11 in ",,Opening batsman,Left-hand bat,Left-arm medium,,,,"[""\nUpstanding, self-effacing and privately educated, Andrew Strauss was the archetypical England captain, and one of their most successful ones. His understated authority underpinned England's rise to the top of the world rankings - for the first time in 31 years, according to back-dated calculations - in a journey that included a home Ashes win in 2009, an even sweeter victory in Australia for the first time since 1986-87, and a 4-0 whitewash to usurp No. 1-ranked India in 2011. \n"", 'A compact left-handed opener, Strauss was severe on the cut shot, efficient off his pads and workmanlike everywhere else. Though most comfortable with pace on the ball, Strauss made two centuries against an Australian attack that included Shane Warne in 2005 and tenacious back-to-back hundreds against India in Chennai in 2008. ', ""His early county cricket with Middlesex did not exactly suggest a star in the making, but a century in 2003 against Lancashire, with Andrew Flintoff haring in, set the selectors sniffing - and also made Strauss believe he had what it took. After a few one-day caps that winter, Strauss was called up for the first Test against New Zealand in 2004 after Michael Vaughan twisted his knee in the Lord's nets. Strauss responded with a confident century, and was on his way to another in the second innings when Nasser Hussain ran him out 17 short. But Hussain had seen enough: with Vaughan set to return, he announced his immediate retirement and Strauss's England career was set.  \t"", 'Strauss flirted with England captaincy in 2006 - dubbing himself ""the stand-in for the stand-in"" in the absence of the injured Vaughan and Flintoff -  and led England to victory at home against Pakistan. Universally admired by his team-mates, it now seems bizarre that a natural leader would ever be overlooked for the captaincy but that\'s exactly what happened for Ashes the following winter.  Flintoff was chosen instead as England flunked to 5-0 loss. It was the first disappointment in Strauss\'s Test career and instigated a slump in form that saw him go 15 matches without a Test hundred. With his England spot looking desperately insecure he produced a eight-hour 177, his highest Test score, to seal a series win in Napier and salvage his career. ', ""His form flooded back and when Kevin Pietersen - Vaughan's successor as captain - and coach Peter Moores fell out spectacularly, England turned to the steadiest pair of hands. He forged a partnership with new team director Andy Flower in 2009 and the 'Andocracy' has since reached almost hallowed status. "", 'During the early part of his England career hundreds came apace - with 10 in his first 30 games - but captaincy, as it so often does, dented his form. Despite centuries in the 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes, Strauss struggled elsewhere and when England lost four consecutive Tests in the 2011-12 winter, murmurings began about his future. But Strauss stayed true to himself - affable, calm and respectful - and began the 2012 season with two hundreds against West Indies to put him within touching distance of the most by an England batsman. However, soon after that, Strauss had a terrible both on and off the field against South Africa - England lost the series 2-0 and with it the number one ranking, Strauss scored 107 runs in six innings, and the Pietersen controversy went from bad to worse. A week after the end of that Test series, Strauss announced his retirement from all international cricket, having played 100 Tests, and having led England to victory in 24 out of 50 Tests in charge.']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005', 'Awarded the OBE in June 2011']",100.0,178,6,7037.0,177,40.91,14385,48.91,21,27,867,10,121.0,0.0,127.0,126,8,4205.0,158,35.63,5195,80.94,6,27,454,25,57.0,0.0,4.0,4,0,73.0,33,18.25,64,114.06,0,0,9,0,1.0,0.0,241.0,424,25,17046,241*,42.72,,,46,74,,,228,0,254.0,247,14,7631,163,32.75,,,10,49,,,90,0,28.0,28,0,519,60,18.53,442,117.42,0,2,73,3,12,0,100.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,1,6,3,0.0,-,-,32.91,3.00,-,0,0,0,4.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,241.0,,132,142,3,1/16,,47.33,6.45,44.0,,0,0,254.0,,6,3,0,-,-,-,3.00,-,0,0,0,28.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

But the Test breakthrough that had coincided with his move from Durham to Surrey never quite resulted in satisfactory returns. None of his five half-centuries went beyond 60 and he was omitted after 11 Tests with an average of 27. His last Test innings had an element of ill luck as Pakistan's legspinner Shadab Khan scuttled one through at shin height out of the footholes. He had won his place at the expense of his close friend and former Durham team-mate Keaton Jennings and, in a role reversal, it was Jennings who replaced him. \n"", ""At Durham, Stoneman had long been regarded as the most reliable opening batsmen in county cricket. Strong square of the wicket, he had eventually prospered in the English game's most northerly outpost like few before him. Yet as he approached his 30th birthday he must have wondered if England would ever come calling. An unobtrusive batting style is one thing, invisibility quite another, but all that changed when Durham hit the financial rocks and, as part of a mass exodus, he moved from Durham to Surrey. "", ""The switch enabled him to revive his relationship with Michael di Venuto, Surrey's coach and a mentor at Durham. By the end of his first run-strewn season in the capital, he had three Test caps against West Indies - making one half-century at Headingley - and Trevor Bayliss, England's coach, who had admitted he had never watched him live, was impressed enough to favour his selection for the Ashes tour of 2017/18."", ""Surrey gained a batsman who had passed 1,000 first-class runs for four successive seasons and with ambition still evident. Another 1,000-run season, including a career-best 197 against Essex, ensured that desire was satisfied in a summer where Surrey boasted the top three Championship run-makers in the country - Kumar Sangakkara, Rory Burns and Stoneman - all taking advantage of true Oval surfaces.  There was a high-profile one-day innings too - 144 against Notts in the Royal London Cup final, even it was overshadowed when Alex Hales retorted with a matchwinning 187, the highest score ever made in a Lord's final."", ""Stoneman did attract England's interest as a teenager. He played at Under-17 and Under-19 level for England, making his bow for the Under-19s in the 2006 World Cup in Sri Lanka, although he had a miserable time, registering just 20 runs in four innings, and trashed a dressing room in frustration after he was dropped. He also spent five seasons with St George in Sydney Grade."", 'He broke into the Durham first team at 20 in the second half of the 2007 season, hitting 50 in his second match against Hampshire before making a real impression with a patient 101 from 232 balls in the victory over Sussex to keep Durham in the title race.  But it was a considerable time before his potential began to be realised. He was part of the Championship-winning squads in 2008 and 2009 but only began to lay claim to a regular place at the top of the order upon the retirement of Australian Michael Di Venuto.', 'His second Championship century some four years after his first, in August 2011, and it was another year before he made his third.  His career average refused to rise much above 30, and it was limited-overs cricket where he first began to make an impact. His 40-over form was outstanding in 2012 and   one of three hundreds included an unbeaten 136 against Scotland at Chester-le-Street, his highest score at that time.', ""\nHe was the club's Batsmen of the Year in 2012 and, as his confidence spread into the four-day game, was a key player in Durham's 2013 title season - indeed, Stoneman and Scott Borthwick passed 1,000 first-class runs in successive seasons, a feat strikingly out of kilter with Durham's history. He also captained the side when Paul Collingwood was out injured, an indication of the growing respect in which he was held, and as one-day captain led Durham to the Royal London Cup in 2014.

And it's true that Ben Stokes' combative nature, allied to his powerful frame and outrageous talent, lifted a somewhat diffident England side to another level. Capable of turning games with his batting, his bowling and in the field - through his character as much as his deeds - Stokes soon attracted comparisons with Ian Botham. Expectations were huge. \n"", 'It is his misfortune therefore that he may be most remembered for two episodes he would rather forget. The first came in the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup final in Kolkata. Asked to defend 19 in the last over against West Indies, his attempted yorkers missed the mark by inches resulting in Carlos Brathwaite heaving him for four successive sixes into a sweltering night sky.', ""The second, and altogether more serious, incident occurred in September 2017. Celebrating an ODI victory in Bristol, Stokes became embroiled in a fight outside a club in the early hours of the morning that resulted in his arrest. A trial at Bristol Crown Court subsequently saw him cleared of the charge of affray but by then the reputational damage had been done. He had already missed the 2017-18 Ashes tour - a toothless England were beaten 4-0 with Stokes not considered for selection - and been stripped of the team's vice-captaincy. "", 'He could console himself with the knowledge that he had the time and the ability to ensure he was remembered for more positive reasons. Within months of his comeback, Stokes had played a key role in England\'s 3-0 Test win in Sri Lanka, their first whitewash series victory in Asia. Trevor Bayliss praised Stokes\' attitude as ""exemplary"", saying he had ""learned his lesson"". ', 'Stokes, from the moment he made his Durham debut, felt very much a product of the northeast of England. He was actually born in Christchurch, New Zealand and came from a rich sporting pedigree with his father, Ged, playing international Rugby League for that country.', 'His prodigious talent was clear from an early age. A true allrounder, Stokes debuted for Durham at 17 and dismissed Mark Ramprakash with his third legal delivery in senior cricket. He enjoyed a productive time at the 2009 Under-19 World Cup, scoring a century against India, before registering a maiden fifty on his first-class debut for Durham. But it was in 2011 that he really began to blossom. In April he took 6 for 68 and scored a brilliant hundred that included five sixes in an over, and a month later registered his maiden limited-overs ton. A broken finger hindered his bowling, but he played for England Lions and made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin, going on to play four times against India, albeit with limited impact.', ""A first brush with the management was to follow, after being called up to the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia in early 2013. Stokes ended up being sent home with three matches remaining, along with Kent's Matt Coles, after two breaches of discipline. It was a watershed moment, and he was rapidly rehabilitated back at Durham, playing a key role in their Championship-winning season and being recalled to England's limited-overs teams. He took a maiden ODI five-for and won selection for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, a return to Australia that would command attention for the right reasons."", ""Stokes' performances were a rare bright spot on a disastrous trip. When the agony was all over, only Stokes returned to England as a star on the rise. Brought into the XI at Adelaide, after Jonathan Trott's untimely departure, his pugnacious nature came to the fore during a maiden Test hundred in Perth, a doughty response out of keeping with England's general demeanour throughout the tour."", 'But with fire came combustibility. Stokes missed the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh after reacting to a dismissal in Barbados by punching a dressing room locker and sustaining a broken wrist. During a difficult year, he was dropped from the Test team after making three ducks in a row against India, and then lost his one-day place on the tour of Sri Lanka - ultimately missing out on selection for the 2015 World Cup.', ""Stokes, like England after a dismal tournament, needed rejuvenating. It began with the Lord's Test against New Zealand, when Stokes scored 92 and 101 after being promoted to bat at No. 6. A successful Ashes followed and he was also a central figure in the new-look ODI side that began to put the World Cup behind them under the guidance of Bayliss and Paul Farbrace. A few months later he produced a barnstorming 258 from 198 balls against South Africa in Cape Town - the fastest England double-hundred in history and the second fastest of all time - during a stand of 399 with Jonny Bairstow."", ""Following his Kolkata nightmare, he nevertheless grew in stature within the side and was promoted to the vice-captaincy (at least until the Bristol episode). He scored his maiden ODI hundred in Dhaka in late 2016 and added four more across international formats the following year, while also taking Test-best figures of 6 for 22 against West Indies at Lord's, becoming a key cog for England despite a chequered injury record."", 'An IPL millionaire twice over - he was bought for £1.7m by Rising Pune Supergiant in 2017, winning tournament MVP, and then picked up for £1.4m the following season by Rajasthan Royals - Stokes was one of the most talked-about players in the world. But there was a sense the best was yet to come. Going into 2019, a year containing an Ashes series and a World Cup, he looked to be a player at the peak of his powers who had finally understood the level of sacrifice and discipline required to coax the best out of his undoubted talent.

In 1886 he scored a world record 485 in 370 minutes for Hampstead against Stoics,  all after spending the entire night before the game playing poker.  But even then the indefatigable Soddart wasn't tired - he spent the rest of the  afternoon playing tennis and finished off with a dinner party in the evening.   That summed up the man.  An excellent rugby three-quarter - he played 10 times for England - his energy was boundless.  An aggressive opening batsman, right-arm medium-pace change bowler, and outstanding fielder, he seemed to epitomise the late amateur Victorian sporting ethos.  He led England on two of his four tours of Australia, and was the first England captain to insert Australia and the first to declare a Test innings closed.  But as he aged his health deteriorated, and faced with his declining powers and burdened by financial worries, he shot himself three weeks after his 52nd birthday.\n"", ' \n', ""\nAndrew Ernest Stoddart, one of the greatest of batsmen, died by his own hand on Saturday, the 3rd of April, shooting himself through the head. A brilliant career thus came to the saddest of ends. Mr. Stoddart was born at South Shields on March 11th, 1863, and had thus completed his 52nd year. Curiously enough, considering the great fame he won, he did not take to cricket seriously until 22 years of age, when he became associated with the Hampstead Club, and showed such form, scoring no fewer than five separate hundreds for that team, that before the end of the season of 1885 he had been tried for Middlesex. From 1886 to 1898, except for the summer of 1888, when he was engaged playing Rugby football in Australia and New Zealand, Mr. Stoddart proved a tower of strength to Middlesex in batting, keeping up his skill so well that in 1898 -- his last full season in county cricket -- he averaged 52. He soon became a popular idol at Lord's, his batting, in conjunction with that of  T. C. O'Brien, making the Middlesex matches far more attractive than they had ever been before his day."", ""He turned out only once for Middlesex in 1899, and twice in the following year, but in his last match for the county -- against Somerset at Lord's -- he put together a score of 221, the highest of his career in first-class cricket. Among his most famous innings were 215 not out against  Lancashire at Manchester in 1891 and 151 for England against the M.C.C. at Lord's in 1887, when he and Arthur Shrewsbury raised the total to 266 for the first wicket. In 1886, for Hampstead against the Stoics, he played an  innings of 485 -- at that time the highest individual score on record."", ""On four occasions Mr. Stoddart paid visits to Australia, first in 1887, as a member of G. F. Vernon's team, when he averaged 32. Four years later he formed one of the side taken out by Lord Sheffield, his average then amounting to 37. In 1894-95, and again in 1897-98, he himself took a team out to Australia. The first of these undertakings resulted in England winning the rubber after two victories had been gained by each country, but the second proved a big disappointment, no fewer than four of the five Test matches ending in favour of Australia. Still, in the two tours associated with his leadership, Mr.  Stoddart came out well with averages of 51 and 34. In the fifth match in the tour of 1894-95, which decided the  rubber in England's favour, J. T. Brown played a memorable  innings of 140, and Albert Ward scored 91. As a Test match player in this country, Mr. Stoddart achieved no special distinction. He took no part in those games in 1890, and although he played in all three matches three years later, making 83 at The Oval, his only other appearances for  England at home were at Lord's and Manchester in  1896."", ""A splendid batsman to watch, Mr. Stoddart had all strokes at his command, but was especially strong in driving and hitting on the leg side. Again and again he proved his greatness by his ability to make runs under conditions which found other batsmen at fault, his play, both on fiery and on soft wickets, being quite exceptional. As a special instance of his power on fiery wickets one recalls a superb innings of 91 for Middlesex against  Surrey at The Oval in 1892. The Oval was not in good order that year, and Lockwood's bowling needed some facing. Stoddart, however, did not mind a bit. Two or three times he hit to the boundary balls that got up as high as his head. Almost equally good was his batting, when in with W. G. Grace, against Richardson and Mold in the Gentlemen and  Players match at Lord's in 1895. In the early part of his career he proved a useful change bowler, and anywhere in the field he was both brilliant and safe. In his early seasons for Middlesex he had onerous work to do on the off-side when George Burton was bowling, but he was never known to flinch."", 'Mr. Stoddart was one of the very few men who have represented their country at Rugby football as well as at cricket. Between 1886 and 1893 he took part in ten international Rugby matches, and would certainly have played in more but for the fact that in two of the intermediate seasons England, owing to a dispute with the other Unions, had no International matches. He appeared twice against Scotland, three times against Ireland, and four times against Wales, while in 1889 he played against the Maories. A splendid runner, with plenty of pace and dodging ability, and not above jumping over an opponent on occasion, he was a great three-quarter -- possessed of a very fine pair of hands -- a brilliant kick, and a player full of resource.', 'It was a memorable drop-kick against a gale of wind he made that, giving Middlesex victory over Yorkshire by a goal to four tries, led to the rules of the game being altered. At that time a goal counted more than any number of tries. Mr. Stoddart captained England against Wales in 1890, when, on a muddy swamp at Dewsbury, Wales, scoring a try to nothing, gained their first victory over England. Another famous match in which he took part was that at Cardiff in 1893, when, after England had established a commanding lead, Wales finished in great form, and, under the method of scoring then in vogue, succeeded in snatching a win by one point. It may be questioned whether any two players ever enjoyed a better understanding than Alan Rotherham, at half, and Andrew Stoddart at three-quarter. Certainly the combination of these two men formed one of the brightest features of the Rugby game in the eighties.']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1893'],16.0,30,2,996.0,173,35.57,,,2,3,,5,6.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,309.0,537,16,16738,221,32.12,,,26,85,,,257,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16.0,6,162,94,2.0,1/10,1/10,47.0,3.48,81.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,309.0,,14717,6571,278,7/67,,23.63,2.67,52.9,,10,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Relying\non touch, he was in his element against the quicks, cover-driving with a neat\nflourish and pulling with panache - most memorably when he thundered two\ncenturies during England's storming of fortress Bridgetown in 1993-94. He was\nless secure against the spinners, however, and his instinctive style meant\nhis career was a sequence of purple patches and less colourful troughs. \n"", ""Stewart's strength as an opening batsman was compromised by the\nselectors' desire for balance: he and Jack Russell swapped the\nwicketkeeping gloves regularly throughout the 1990s, but Stewart, better\nstanding back than standing up, eventually became the regular No. 1.

Despite calls for a younger wicketkeeper to take his place, Stewart continued to give his all for England until he called it a day from all forms of the game after England's drawn series with South Africa in 2003.

Brian Statham was one of the best of all English fast bowlers, and beyond question the best-liked. A gentle man who had to be persuaded to bowl a bouncer, he was a mainstay of the England team in its vintage period between 1951 and 1963: he took 252 wickets in 70 Tests. His name will forever be coupled with that of Freddie Trueman, though they actually played together in only half his Tests. Statham\'s name always came second because he was the foil to Trueman\'s sabre - and the more reticent man. In cricketing folklore he is remembered primarily for his accuracy: ""If they miss, I hit,"" he would say. This diminishes his astonishing skill. He was indeed accurate; so are many fast-medium bowlers. Statham kept his line and length at a very high pace indeed, comparable with all but the very fastest of Test match bowlers. A batsman hit by Statham - even on the foot, which was more likely than the head - knew all about it. In Statham\'s case the area around off stump was more a corridor of certainty than uncertainty, but if the ball hit the seam it jagged back in very sharply. The results were always formidable, and occasionally devasting. \n', 'Statham came from Gorton, in Manchester. There was no silver spoon, but there was cricket in his background: three of his brothers appeared in local leagues. He played for Denton West and then Stockport, but Lancashire never noticed him. His corporal during national service in the RAF - a southerner - recommended him to MCC, however. He was told to write to Old Trafford, and Statham was offered a trial. In May 1950 he was on the ground staff; a month after reporting to the coach, Harry Makepeace, he was in the first team. It was his 20th birthday: ""He was a youngster who carried his flannels in a canvas bag,"" said Wisden, ""and his boots in a brown paper parcel."" His reputation grew quietly until the Roses match at Old Trafford in August, when he shocked a huge and expectant crowd by immediately falling over in his run-up. He picked himself up, dusted himself down and later that over ripped out Frank Lowson\'s middle stump. In the same spell he also dismissed Ted Lester and Willie Watson; all three got ducks and Wisden said his bowling ""bordered on the sensational"". Five months later, along with his county colleague, Roy Tattersall, he was flown out to Australia to join Freddie Brown\'s injury-stricken party. Both Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton, who had seen him at close quarters in the Roses match, argued for him, though many in the party had never seen him. Coming straight from a hard English winter, Statham played his first first-class game for MCC on a day of extreme midsummer heat at Adelaide. It might have broken some young players but, with his easy-going, beer-and-fags style, Statham was soon just ""George"" to everyone and fitted in beautifully. It was the New Zealand leg of the tour before he made his mark on the field, with figures of four for 17 in more Mancunian conditions against Otago. Then in Christchurch, ten months after his arrival at Old Trafford, he became a Test cricketer.', 'It took a while for him to make the impact in Tests that he had in county cricket, and he made only occasional appearances for England over the next three seasons. None the less, he continued to improve - 97 wickets at just 15.11 in 1951, 110 at 18.08 in 1952, 101 at 16.33 in 1953. Even more significantly, he quickened up to the point of being a genuine fast bowler rather than a sharp fast-medium, and on the difficult West Indies tour of 1953-54 he came into his own. At Sabina Park, he opened the bowling with Trueman for the first time for England and, in the Third Test at Georgetown, turned the series with a devastating new-ball spell, sending back Worrell, Stollmeyer and Walcott for ten runs. Alex Bannister of the Daily Mail reported that Stollmeyer had received the best fast ball bowled for England since Alec Bedser bowled Bradman for a duck at Adelaide seven years earlier.', ""Statham was England's leading wicket-taker in Tests in the West Indies, and the following winter he reached his peak. The name in the headlines was Frank Tyson, whose ferocious bursts at Sydney and Melbourne gave England the Ashes. But the quiet man made it possible: while Tyson raced with the wind at Sydney, Statham battled into it; he took five for 60 to restrict Australia's lead in the first innings at Melbourne, and gave the batsmen no respite in the second, when Tyson took seven for 27. By now, with Bedser fading, Statham was England's most reliable bowler. And sometimes he was more than that. At Lord's in 1955, he bowled unchanged in the second innings as South Africa were dismissed for 111 to lose a match they had been dominating. His figures were 29-12-39-7: it was a feat of endurance even allowing for a lunch break extended to two hours by bad light."", 'All this time, he was - year after year - Lancashire\'s leading bowler. And lacking anyone to give him the support he himself provided so unstintingly for England, until the emergence of Ken Higgs in 1958, he sometimes had to do all the work himself. At Coventry in 1957, he bowled Lancashire to an innings win with match figures of 15 for 89. Though he dipped in and out of the England team, through injuries and the whims of selection, his form remained constant, whether or not it was reflected in the statistics. A half-volley remained a major event. On the unhappy Ashes tour of 1958-59, he took seven for 57 on the way to defeat at Melbourne, and reports suggested he often bowled just as well for less reward. He had a few final hurrahs for England in the early 1960s, but on his fourth Ashes tour, in 1962-63, his pace had declined; the following summer he appeared to fade out of Test cricket. Yet he was recalled two years later and, together with Higgs, bowled out South Africa for 208 at The Oval. He was 35 but still took 137 wickets that season at 12.52 and could apparently have gone on a fifth Ashes tour had he wanted. By now, he was Lancashire captain, a job he held for three years. His performances never wavered and Lancashire\'s were reasonable, although by the end, Wisden said, his decisions ""often puzzled"". It was a happy ship, though: ""Fewer jollier bands have ever laughed and sung their way through the shires,"" said Derek Hodgson, who travelled with them for the Daily Express. In 1967 Statham passed Johnny Briggs to become Lancashire\'s leading wicket-taker, and he added 69 more in his last season, 1968. In all first-class cricket, he took 2,260 wickets, putting him 19th on the all-time list. But his average of 16.37 is the best of the top 20 wicket-takers and beaten only by Briggs - who bowled on the primitive pitches of the 19th century - among the top 30.', 'His methods remain a matter of some debate. His action was certainly too chest-on to be accepted as classical. He swung the ball only rarely, and perhaps never by design. Part of the secret seems to have been that Statham was not merely supple but double-jointed. ""He could put his right arm round his face and touch his right ear and do the same with his left arm and his left ear at the same time,"" said an admiring Geoff Pullar. He was certainly an impressive athlete: a beautiful outfielder and an occasionally effective left-handed tailender. His bowling quality was never in dispute. Nor was his character: he had an enchantingly easy-going temperament. ""I only saw him lose his rag twice,"" said Pullar, his Lancashire and England team-mate. ""Both times he was certain they had gloved a catch. One was Easton McMorris in the West Indies - he hit him on the chest and made him spit blood. The other was `Pom-Pom\' Fellows-Smith, and he knocked his cap off."" Even the accuracy seems to have been a reflection of his temperament: ""I\'m not going to run in 30 yards and watch a batsman shoulder arms,"" Statham once said. ""It\'s a waste of energy.""', 'Despite his huge popualarity, his life after cricket was a difficult one. He was employed by Guinness to go round pubs and clubs - more celebrity PR than selling. But after the company was taken over, a stern new management tried to force timetables and paperwork on him, and Statham\'s life was made intolerable. He became ill and in 1989 his financial plight was such that his friend Trueman organised some benefit dinners for him. More than 1,000 turned up at the Grosvenor House in London. He was a cricketer who engendered admiration and affection from both those who saw him from a distance, and those who knew him best. ""I knew him for 50 years and we never had a wrong word,"" said Trueman.\n']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1955', 'Awarded CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1966 for services to cricket']",70.0,87,28,675.0,38,11.44,,,0,0,,5,28.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,559.0,647,145,5424,62,10.80,,,0,5,,,230,0,15.0,11,6,72,36,14.40,,,0,0,,,4,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70.0,129,16056,6261,252.0,7/39,11/97,24.84,2.33,63.7,9,9,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,559.0,,100955,36999,2260,8/34,,16.37,2.19,44.6,,123,11,15.0,,991,464,22,5/28,5/28,21.09,2.80,45.0,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

If he\'d been Australian he would have been an automatic pick for every Test when fit. But he was strong-willed and difficult, and, being subject to the whims of English panels of selectors, he won only 49 Test caps. Even more absurdly, he went on only three tours. He was dropped twice in unusual circumstances: by Sussex for ""not trying"", and by England for barging India\'s Sunil Gavaskar off his feet at Lord\'s in 1971. Gavaskar, the non-striker, had crossed Snow\'s running line in going for a quick single after the ball had been pushed towards mid-on. Two years earlier, in Pakistan, Snow had cost himself another cap by bowling fast bouncers at Tom Graveney, the vice-captain, on a dangerous net pitch in Lahore the day before a Test. The son of a Church of England clergyman, Snow was a strange mixture altogether. Away from cricket, until he mellowed, he could be unapproachable. But his artistic flair was manifest in two published books of poetry, and in retirement he unexpectedly set up a successful travel agency. For England he reached his peak in West Indies and Australia, where his 31 Test wickets in 1970-71, combined with 1305 runs from Boycott and Edrich, were Ray Illingworth\'s main weapon in winning back the Ashes. In rhythm, accuracy, pace and possession of a vicious bouncer, Snow had much in common with Glenn McGrath of Australia as a spearhead. But in one respect they widely differed: Snow never needed to resort to sledging to make a batsman feel uncomfortable.

Surprisingly, he was uninspired as manager in two tours in the 1990s. His great strength as a batsman was his pragmatism. He observed that that all bowlers except offspinners had most of their fielders on the off side, so considered it only sensible to aim to score most of his runs to leg, which he dubbed ""The man\'s side"". He was a quick judge of line and length (despite, or perhaps because of, wearing glasses), a six-footer of wiry strength, and the possessor of a strong right hand.

Born on February 6, 1886, Ernest James Smith was just 10 years old when he watched Kent v Warwickshire from a tree outside his beloved Edgbaston ground. From that day he was hooked on Warwickshire cricket. It was a relationship which mellowed over the years and right up to the recent Test match at Edgbaston he was a familiar, well-loved figure at the ground.', 'During that Test it was heart-warming to see men like Bob Willis, Geoff Boycott and Mike Brearley ask him for advice that was readily given and sensibly atriculated with his trusty stick tapping the ground for extra emphasis. It was difficult to imagine, while listening to him analysing Gower""s technique or Taylor""s skills behind the stumps, that this man had played many times with W. G. Grace, had kept wicket behind men like Victor Trumper, Clem Hill, Gilbert Jessop and C. B. Fry, had batted against the likes of Wilfred Rhodes, Colin Blythe and J. J. Kotze.', 'He had a colossal memory for incidents in bygone matches yet he could be gracious in his praise of the great modern players. \'This here Viv Richards is a great player,"" he told me during the Somerset match this season. \'I came here today to criticise him but when his first five scoring shots go for boundaries, what can you say?""', 'He was proud to uphold the traditional values of the game (\'It""s a sideways-on game,"" he""d say while wincing at the defects of the current England batsmen, \'doesn""t anybody tell them that these days?"").', 'On the second day of the Warwickshire v Lancashire match at Edgbaston, (August 13) E. J. (\'Tiger"") Smith set up a new record of longevity for a professional cricketer. Smith made his first-class debut for Warwickshire, against the South Africans at Edgbaston, on June 16, 1904 and was thus alive 75 years 59 days after his debut, exceeding the record for a professional held by Wilfred Rhodes. He had extended the period to 75 years 77 days at the time of his death.', 'A very small number of amateurs exceed Smith. F. A. Mackinnon died in 1947, 76 years 284 days after his first-class debut for Cambridge University, while others to reach 76 years were H. M. Lawrence (Kent), died 1975, and J. Gilman (MCC), died 1976.', 'However, the English record appears to be held by H. Jenner, who died in 1904, 77 years 57 days after his appearance for Cambridge in the 1827 University match. Even Jenner has to give best to the Australian-born John Wheatley, however. Wheatley made his first-class debut for Canterbury against Otago in February 1883, and died aged 102 in 1962, 79 years 78 days afterwards.', 'But nobody could ever accuse \'Tiger"" of living in the past. In his last few days he struggled painfully but cheerfully (\'I""ve told \'em I want hops on my coffin not lilies,"" he""d joke)- but he""d still constructively analyse the batting of Gooch (\'You come back and tell me I""m a bloody fool if you like- but you take a look at his front foot"")- or the wicketkeeping of Bob Taylor (\'They""d be mad not to take him to Australia- he""s got the best pair of hands in the game"").', 'And no man alive was better qualified to comment on the art of wicketkeeping: on the 1911-12 tour of Australia he stood up to Barnes and Foster in four Tests on those lightning fast wickets. By common consent he kept immaculately, with the highlight a superb leg-side stumping of Clem Hill off Frank Foster at Adelaide (\'Bob Crockett, the umpire at square leg, said  Good God, Clem, you""re out and I said Aye, and by a long way! I did it again in the second innings but the other umpire was asleep!"").', 'He could bat too- nearly 17,000 runs and 20 centuries in a career lasting from 1904 to 1930- and in his last season he was still fit enough to score a hundred before lunch against Essex-\'and I even had time to drink a glass of Guinness before the players came off for lunch!""', 'At the time of his death he was the oldest living Test cricketer - but his real love was Warwickshire. As the county""s coach in the immediate post-war years his disciplinarian yet kindly methods yielded an outstanding crop of players - and even in his last days, he talked with warm affection of his \'boys""- players like David Brown, Dennis Amiss, John Jameson, Jack Bannister, Tom Cartwright and Neal Abberley. And the respectful attention the players continually showed him spoke volumes.', 'It""s not an overstatement to say that \'Tiger"" Smith was a legend in the game. It""s difficult to think of any Englishman with a more distinguished career in three major facets of the game - 11 Tests as a player, nine seasons as a first-class umpire (including eight Tests) and coach to the champion county in 1951.', 'He was present at some of cricket""s great moments - at Leyton in 1932 he signalled the boundary that posted the new world record first-wicket stand by Holmes and Sutcliffe. He kept to Syd Barnes as he mesmerised 49 South African victims in just four Tests in 1913-14.

Small, a last-minute replacement, stunned a Boxing Day crowd of 58,000 at the MCG by splitting Australia's first innings wickets with Ian Botham. Small took 5 for 48 and Australia were rolled over for 141. When England won, Small was named Man of the Match, as much for his enthusiasm as anything: he was always a whole-hearted tryer, a committed team man and a delightful guy. Australia's discomfiture was increased by Small's strange build: seemingly without a neck, he walked around as though he still had a coathanger inside his jacket. He came to England from Barbados just after his 14th birthday, the cut-off date for automatic qualification. However, the combination of his looks and his then-pair of nerdish specs made the Lord's registration committee think he had no chance of ever playing Test cricket anyway, so they let him through. In good times, Small might not have played for England; he was neither especially fast nor reliable, and early in his career was an infuriatingly regular no-baller. But he cut his run right down and settled for being predominately an outswing bowler, still hostile enough to worry even the best batsmen, as Australia found again a week after the MCG, when he whipped through the middle order in Sydney. Like most players of that era, he then drifted in and out of the England side but took eight wickets in the defeat at Bridgetown in 1989-90 and was still a key figure for Warwickshire in their all-conquering year of 1994.\n"", ' \n']",[],17.0,24,7,263.0,59,15.47,601,43.76,0,1,31,0,9.0,0.0,53.0,24,9,98.0,18*,6.53,188,52.12,0,0,7,,7.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,315.0,404,97,4409,70,14.36,,,0,7,,,95.0,0.0,390.0,191,65,1072,40*,8.50,,,0,0,,,74.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17.0,31,3927,1871,55.0,5/48,8/183,34.01,2.85,71.4,4,2,0,53.0,53,2793,1942,58.0,4/31,4/31,33.48,4.17,48.1,1,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,315.0,,49567,24392,852,7/15,,28.62,2.95,58.1,,29,2,390.0,,18434,12230,462,5/18,5/18,26.47,3.98,39.9,9,5,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

The accolade everybody anticipated became his three years later, when Alastair Cook stood down after the 2016-17 tour of India. It was understandable that there were a few fears for Root's future workload. He was rare among England batsmen in achieving maturity so quickly, and had looked consumed by the delights of batting from the moment he first took guard. Now he had new responsibilities.  \n"", ""Slight of build, perky of shot and with a scampish grin that got under a bowler's skin, by the time Root was appointed Test captain he had rattled up 53 Tests within five years with an average top side of 50, comfortably the highest among contemporary England players. Early expectations that he would establish himself as an opener did not materialise as an expansive game increasingly seemed better suited to No. 3 or No. 4. He was equally influential in limited-overs cricket where England's commitment to fearless cricket after their 2015 World Cup was much to his tastes, his crispness of stroke and shrewd judgment enabling him to bat purposefully around batsmen of greater weight of shot."", ""Root had never been a strikingly heavy scorer as he worked through the ranks, nor was he particularly athletic, but his systematic approach was that of a young batsman who would not sell his wicket easily and gave England hope that he would be able to attune his game to the highest level. A slender batsman reliant on precision, his patience and stubbornness at the crease had Geoffrey Boycott gushing that he reminded him of himself, although Root soon developed a much broader range. Others saw some of his mentor Michael Vaughan in Root's front-foot drive - the pair also both attended Sheffield Collegiate."", ""Root's Test debut for England in Nagpur in 2012 exemplified the qualities which had attracted coaches from an early age. Picked to tour India on the strength of two encouraging seasons with Yorkshire - and having been named Cricket Writers' Club Young Player of the Year - he impressed enough to be selected for the final Test of the series. He began with England's sixth-longest debut innings in terms of balls faced, scoring 73 from 229 balls as he displayed the patience and discrimination demanded both by the situation of the game and a desperately slow surface. "", ""His rise continued with a maiden Test hundred in his home ground, Headingley, against New Zealand in 2013 followed by a maiden Ashes century at Lord's having been promoted to open. Root looked set to occupy that role for many years to come, but his fortunes dipped as the series went on and then crashed along with the team as England were whitewashed in Australia in 2013-14. He began the tour at No. 6, moved up to No. 3 after the enforced departure of Jonathan Trott, then saw his Ashes ended early when he was dropped for the fifth Test in Sydney."", ""Proof of Root's ability came in the way he responded. Back in England, he followed up a two-tone double hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's - a disciplined innings with a freewheeling finale - with two more big hundreds against India. All three had the not-out asterisk. That seemed to say a lot about him."", 'He even had the fortune to skipper Yorkshire to the Championship title at Trent Bridge in 2014 when Andrew Gale was suspended, less than a fortnight after he became the first Yorkshire batsman to hit an ODI hundred at Headingley, with India the victims. He was also in charge for Yorkshire\'s thumping defeat at Middlesex, in which they chased down 472 in the fourth innings. To his amusement, his team-mates dubbed him ""Craptain"". ', ""His full potential then poured forth in 2015 when he made 1385 Test runs in the year, and vied with Australia's Steven Smith at the top of the ICC Test rankings. Root played with alacrity on all surfaces and in all formats and his obvious delight in his art was a positive symbol in an England side committed in all formats to a more enterprising approach. Jaunty Ashes hundreds at Cardiff and Nottingham helped England to victories, his consistency at No. 4 repeatedly masked top-order frailties, and a mischievous sense of humour made his success all the more pleasurable."", 'As England fell to defeat against Pakistan in the UAE in late 2015, a pattern began to build up which piqued Root even as he confirmed himself as one of the best batsmen around: his world became rather too full of entertaining 70s and 80s when he felt that a big hundred was there for the taking. Between his hundred in Johannesburg in early 2016 on a triumphant England tour and a century in Rajkot as England slumped 4-0 to India, he passed 50 six times but only converted one into a hundred. There again, it was quite a hundred: a career-best 254 against Pakistan at Old Trafford that banished talk of premature burnout in a non-stop England programme.', 'Firmly established among the modern game\'s ""Big Four"" batsmen (Root, Smith, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson), these were years of easy scoring. In 2015 and 2016 he set consecutive records for runs accumulated across all formats in a calendar year for England, with 2228 and 2570 respectively; in 2017, he came within five runs of surpassing Vaughan\'s calendar high-water mark of 1481 for England in Tests, which had stood since 2002. The following summer, with back-to-back efforts against India, Root surpassed Marcus Trescothick\'s English record of 12 ODI hundreds.', ""Problems of conversion returned to afflict him in his second year as Test captain, however. Having made a matchwinning 190 against South Africa at Lord's, in his first match in charge, and a century in England's first day-night Test, against West Indies at Edgbaston, he went more than a year before again reaching three figures in a Test. That period included another unsuccessful Ashes tour of Australia, where Root topped the England averages but could only manage a highest score of 83. Defeat in New Zealand followed, then a messy draw at home to Pakistan, before England rallied to beat No. 1 side India 4-1 and give Root encouragement in his plans to rebuild the Test side."", '\n', '\n']",[],80.0,147,12,6685.0,254,49.51,12059,55.43,16,41,755,19,91.0,0.0,126.0,119,19,5090.0,133*,50.9,5871,86.69,14,29,407,40,57.0,0.0,31.0,29,5,846.0,90*,35.25,665,127.21,0,5,87,16,18.0,0.0,137.0,239,22,10474,254,48.26,18614,56.26,25,56,1226,29,128.0,0.0,165.0,157,25,6374,133*,48.28,7472,85.30,15,38,523,45,69.0,0.0,71.0,65,13,1572,92*,30.23,1246,126.16,0,9,175,24,32.0,0.0,80.0,70,1968,986,20.0,2/9,2/9,49.3,3.00,98.4,0,0,0,126.0,60,1342,1299,20.0,3/52,3/52,64.95,5.80,67.1,0,0,0,31.0,9,84,139,6.0,2/9,2/9,23.16,9.92,14.0,0,0,0,137.0,124,3613,1840,40,4/5,4/5,46.00,3.05,90.3,1,0,0,165.0,85,1929,1798,34,3/52,3/52,52.88,5.59,56.7,0,0,0,71.0,31,264,415,10,2/9,2/9,41.50,9.43,26.4,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

His international career is now behind him but he can draw much satisfaction not only from the manner in which he took a belated second chance in international cricket, but the way that latterly he has committed himself with skill and determination to an extended career on England's professional circuit with Yorkshire, the county of his birth. \n"", 'Like his father Arnie, who was an accomplished footballer and one-time Test player, Ryan made his county debut for Yorkshire having previously impressed the scouts of Sheffield United Football Club. For much of his career it appeared Sidebottom jnr, a left-armer unlike Arnie, would also follow his father in Test cricket by remaining a one-cap wonder. He was handed his debut in 2001 against Pakistan, but after a wicketless performance was banished back to county cricket. Although he bowled tidily throughout, he was generally considered to be out of his depth and was quickly discarded, and seemingly forgotten after two poor ODIs against Zimbabwe that October. He proved them wrong, possessing a resolve and bowling nous that few had recognised.', 'He left Yorkshire in 2004 and headed to nearby Nottinghamshire, where he impressed in his first two seasons. The first year there he helped them to a double promotion, and the second year he took 50 first-class wickets to become the Player of the Year and help them to the Championship title for the first time in 18 years.', ""With Duncan Fletcher, England's coach, obsessed by finding bowlers of true pace, Sidebottom was continually overlooked despite having one of the best records in the country. However, six years after his debut - under the new Peter Moores regime - he was surprisingly recalled after a spate of injuries to England's attack. He responded with eight wickets against West Indies at Headingley, still his spiritual home, and developed into a key member of the line-up. He helped England to a 3-0 win over West Indies before bowling without luck against India."", ""Equally impressive with the white ball he was Man of the Series as England won the one-day tournament in Sri Lanka, but it was during the New Zealand leg of England's winter that he really shone, decimating the hosts with 24 wickets at 17.08, including 7 for 47 in the final Test in Napier."", ""Further success followed in the home series against New Zealand, during which he was unveiled as England's Player of the Year, but the pressures of carrying England's attack took their toll, and he struggled for fitness thereafter, culminating in an Achilles injury that limited him to a single wicket in an arduous tour of the Caribbean in February 2009. While injuries dented his opportunities in Test cricket thereafter he became an important member of the one-day side. In the 2010 World Twenty20 in the Caribbean his selection ahead of James Anderson raised a few eyebrows, but he proved the doubters wrong as his fiery and disciplined opening bowling was a crucial part of England's triumph."", 'His England career, though, ended with his international retirement late in 2010, leaving him to play out time on the domestic scene. After helping Nottinghamshire to a last-gasp Championship title that summer, he returned to his Yorkshire roots for the final stage of his career.', 'Given that Yorkshire were relegated it was not immediately the return he hoped for, although on a personal level 2011 was a highly successful season. His 62 first-class wickets at 22.00, including three five-wicket hauls and a career best 7 for 37 against Somerset at Headingley, were the most he had taken in a single season. He contributed useful runs, too, including two fifties in an aggregate of 389 in the Championship. His 61 against Worcestershire at New Road was a career best. ', ""He missed a large part of the 2012 promotion season to injury but signed a further contract extension until the end of 2015 towards the end of a summer which saw him lead Yorkshire's Championship bowling records with 49 wickets at 20.30 apiece. He won the Members' Player of the Year award as a result, and hankered after 700 first-class wickets before he took his boots off for the last time. He achieved a landmark achieved by few in spectacular style against Middlesex as Yorkshire completed successive Championship wins, taking four wickets in his first four overs, including a hat-trick, and topping the county averages at 37. Five years on from his international retirement, his longevity was deeply impressive."", 'As well as leaving his father, Arnie - 596 first-class victims - by now a long way in his slipstream, he also had five Championship titles, adding two with Yorkshire to the three won with Notts. He swung the ball as consistently as any bowler on the county circuit and his accuracy was exemplary.

In three of his four years in the XI at Highgate School he headed both batting and bowling averages, being captain in the last, 1925, when, with an innings of 206 and seven wickets for 54 runs against Aldenham his outstanding performance, he scored 816 runs, average 62.76, and dismissed 60 batsmen for 15.18 runs apiece. He also captained the Highgate football XI. In 1925, while still at school, he made his first appearance for Middlesex, for whom he played irregularly till 1950. In all first-class cricket, he hit 13,490 runs, average 26.45, and took 946 wickets at 23.59 runs each--figures which do not convey his true worth. \n"", 'From an early age, Robbie was taught the rudiments of the game by his father, a Staffordshire player, and as a boy he assisted East Molesey C.C. He attributed his success to an indefatigable, patient male parent, but whatever the reason, he always displayed an aggressively enterprising attitude to the game, whether in batting, bowling, fielding, particularly at cover point, or in captaincy, which made him immensely popular with spectators and frequently swayed the course of a match.', ""He got his Blue as a Freshman at Cambridge in 1926 purely as a batsman, scoring 37 and 21 not out. In the next season's University match he hit 55 and 41, sending down only one over; but in 1928 he not only put together innings of 53 and 101 not out, but took eight wickets for 151 runs, almost bringing success over Oxford. That gained him a place in the Gentlemen's team against the Players for the first of numerous occasions. Impatient of dull cricket, Robins wasted few scoring opportunities as a batsman, employing his nimble footwork and flexible wrists to the full, especially in cutting and driving. His example transformed a hitherto drab Middlesex side when he took over the captaincy from 1935 to 1938. He also led the county in 1946, 1947--when they carried off the Championship--and 1950."", ""In his first full season for them, 1929, he achieved his only double, scoring 1,134 runs, including one century, and taking 162 wickets, but more than once he came near repeating that feat. He took part in 19 Test matches for England, being captain in the home series with New Zealand in 1937, and in these he made 612 runs, average 26.60, and took 64 wickets for 27.46 runs each. His highest innings in a Test was 108, when runs were sorely needed, against South Africa at Old Trafford in 1935, and his best bowling analysis six wickets for 32 runs against the West Indies at Lord's in 1933. His one major tour abroad was to Australia in 1936-37, when he was vice-captain under G. O. Allen. Unfortunately he broke a finger of the right hand at fielding practice in the first week of the tour with the result that he could not spin the ball and achieved small bowling success. At the age of 45, he captained the M.C.C. team which visited Canada in 1951, meeting with considerable all-round success."", ""As a bowler of leg-bowlers and googlies, Robins could not always command a good length; but though he sometimes came in for punishment he was always capable of producing a telling delivery. Twice he did the  hat-trick for Middlesex: against Leicestershire in 1929 and against Somerset in 1937, both at Lord's. At Trent Bridge in 1930, he bowled Sir Donald Bradman with a googly to which that famous batsman did not offer a stroke and virtually won the game for England. One recalls, too, an occasion at Lord's when Robins, arriving late through business claims, put himself on to bowl directly he took the field. Nottinghamshire at that time were making runs comfortably, with F. W. Stocks, the left-hander, well set. The last ball of an over from Robins pitched so near the end of the popping crease on the batsman's off-side that he completely ignored it. To his astonishment, the ball turned almost at right-angles and hit the stumps! No wonder that Robbie doubled up with laughter."", 'As a Test team selector, Robins served from 1946 to 1949 and again in 1954 and was chairman of the Committee from 1962 to 1964. He began this latter period by issuing an ultimatum to first-class cricketers: Play aggressively at all times; otherwise you will not be chosen for England. It cannot be said that this produced precisely the results desired, but at least it relieved Test cricket of some of the stagnation which threatened its popularity at the time. Robins also ably filled the position of manager of the M.C.C. team in the West Indies in 1959-60.', 'As an Association footballer, he displayed much of the same dash which distinguished him on the cricket field. He played on the right wing for Cambridge in the University matches of 1926, 1927 and 1928, being captain in the second season, and he appeared with credit for that celebrated amateur club, the Corinthians.

And at Test level, no more elegant pair than Len Hutton and Robertson ever opened England's batting. Unfortunately for the Southerner, and for impartial spectators, Hutton and Robertson opened together in only three Tests - two in West Indies in 1947-48, and at Lord's in 1949- because Lancashire's Washbrook was invariably seen as slightly superior against fast bowling. \n"", ""This led to the absurdity of Robertson's omission after scoring 121 against New Zealand in that Lord's Test (143 with Hutton for the first wicket), because the injured Washbrook recovered in time for the next Test. So Robertson had the rare distinction of a century in his final home Test: to which he added two half-centuries at Madras in his last England appearance, on the 1951-52 tour of India."", "" John David Benbow Robertson was born in Chiswick on Feb 22, 1917. His father was a regular player with Turnham Green. At 15 Jack played for Middlesex 2nds, and came under the watchful eyes of Plum Warner and coach Jack Durston. His first-class debut in 1937 saw him stumped for a duck at Oxford. Capped in 1939, when he was 22, Robertson then found himself one of cricket's lost generation as world war cut away six summers. A driver in the RASC during the Dunkirk evacuation, he ended the war as a captain in the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, and a battle-school instructor. He was also responsible for a famous act of patriotic defiance during a Services match of Lord's in 1944. A flying-bomb just missed Lord's and exploded near the church. The players, having thrown themselves to the turf, then resumed play, and Robertson hooked Bob Wyatt's first ball into the Grandstand."", ""His career with Middlesex ( 1937-59) was exemplary. Fourteen times he reached 1000 runs in a season, going on past 2000 in nine of them. He came within 83 runs of 3000 in 1951, but was at his peak in the late 1940s. The golden 1947 season may well be branded with the names of Compton and Edrich, who both passed 2000 for Middlesex, but Jack Robertson (2214 runs at 65.12, with 11 centuries) and his opening partner Syd Brown (1709) were also key agents in the winning of the Championship. They followed their first-wicket stand of 310 against Notts with 222 against Yorkshire, both at Lord's. The former was a record until Eric Russell and Pasty Harris bettered it against the 1967 Pakistanis."", ""  Robertson's 1947 fluency earned him a place as one of "", ""'s Five Cricketers of the Year. Alan Melville, South Africa's captain, and Walter Robins, the Middlesex skipper, declared him the best player of the new ball in England. And in 1948 he continued to sparkle, with twin centuries at Lord's against Sussex in Laurie Gray's benefit match, and season's aggregate of 2366 at 50.34. But there was a setback in July, when a bouncer from Lindwall broke his jaw."", ""In the preceding winter he had headed England's Test averages in the Caribbean with 390 at 55.71, his First Test century coming in Trinidad, where England were in danger on the matting surface. Robertson's 133 spanned 5¾ hours (15 fours) and saved the match, though the debut centuries from S. C. Griffith and Andy Ganteaume remain better-remembered."", ""This was Robertson's destiny. Self-effacing, abstemious, a pillar of decency and integrity, he so often allowed others the spotlight of glory. Even when, in 1949, he scored 331 not out, still the Middlesex record and the highest score made in Worcester's wondrous setting, he made much of the fact that his pleasure was dulled when he found his car-tyres deflated that evening, the story told with an amused air."", 'His 11 Tests brought him 881 runs at 46.37, figures which point to fickle selection, and in all first-class cricket his 31,914 runs (37.50) contained 67 centuries.

Later, in front of Sheppard's home-county crowd at Hove, he and Dewes (212) improved on that with a stand of 349 against Sussex. \n"", ""Such form won Sheppard a place in the 1950 Test Trial, a match rather ruined by Jim Laker, who found the Bradford pitch to his liking and bowled out The Rest for 27 before lunch on the first day, taking 8 for 2.

But he was in the selectors' thoughts, and made his debut in the final Test of the summer, scoring 29 and 11 at The Oval as England lost again to go down 3-1 to West Indies. Sheppard toured Australia that winter, with Freddie Brown's young but outgunned side, and played in three of the Tests with little success. He fell out of favour for a time, but returned in 1952 with 119, his first Test century, in the final Test against India at The Oval. The following year he captained Sussex, and spirited them up to second in the table, equalling their best performance until that long-awaited first Championship triumph in 2003.

It was the middle one of an impressive hat-trick of hunches from the selectors - Cyril Washbrook (who actually was one of the selectors) was brought back for the third Test, his first for five years, and scored 98 after England had been 17 for 3; then in the final Test at The Oval Denis Compton made a comeback after a knee operation and made 94."", ""Sheppard continued to make occasional appearances for Sussex, and in 1960 he refused to captain the Duke of Norfolk's XI against the touring South Africans in protest against the apartheid regime.  But his Test days appeared to be behind him - until 1962, when there was some debate about who should captain England on that winter's Ashes tour. Ted Dexter was the man in possession, but Colin Cowdrey captained in one Test against Pakistan that summer, and the waters were further muddied when Sheppard emerged from semi-retirement. He scored 112 for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's and then, in his next match, 83 in the fourth Test. He was heavily tipped for the captaincy in Australia - but in the end it went to Dexter."", 'Sheppard did go to Australia for his second tour there, and scored 113 in the second Test at Melbourne, and 66 in the fifth at Sydney. In between, some fallible catching irked Fred Trueman, who reportedly advised him to keep his hands together a bit more often in the field. Another possibly apocryphal story has Sheppard eventually clinging on to a spectacular catch in the outfield, and showing the ball to the crowd who had been hooting his errors ... only for Fred Titmus to run over from his fielding position and ask for the ball back ""as it was a no-ball and they\'ve already run five"".', 'Sheppard wrapped up his first-class career with the three Tests that followed in New Zealand. He finished with 1172 runs (37.80) in 22 Tests, and 15,838 runs in all first-class cricket at the useful average of 43.51, with 45 centuries.', 'Concentrating on the Church, Sheppard worked for a time at the Mayflower Centre in London, before becoming Bishop of Woolwich in 1968, and moving up to Liverpool in 1975. He retired in 1997, and was made a Life Peer in 1998. He wrote two volumes of autobiography: ', ' in 1966, and ', ' in 2002.', ""He kept in touch with cricket over the years, being one of the main voices opposing the South African tour in the apartheid days of 1970 (and being disappointed that previous friendships were ruptured by his views), while in 1995 he gave an entertaining speech at the annual launch dinner of the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack."", 'His wife of 47 years, Grace, survived a skirmish with cancer early in their married life, but Sheppard himself contracted bowel cancer in 2001.

August 11, 1870, Byfleet, Surrey ","July 2, 1912, St Jean d'Arvey, Chambery, Savoie, France (aged 41 years 326 days) ",,"['England,', 'London County,', 'Somerset,', 'Surrey']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm fast,,,,"['\n', ""\nTom Richardson, whose tragic end caused such a painful shock to his friends, was born at Byfleet, August 11, 1870; died at St Jean d'Arvey, July 2, 1912. He will live in cricket history as perhaps the finest of all fast bowlers. Among the only men who can be placed with him are George Freeman, John Jackson and William Lockwood. Many famous batsmen, among them Ranjitsinhji, contend that on his good days Lockwood was more difficult to play than Richardson, but for consistent excellence there was no comparison between the two bowlers. While he was at his best - from 1893 to 1897 inclusive - Richardson scarcely knew what it was to be out of form. Allowing for the excellence of the wickets on which he had to bowl, it is quite safe to say that his work during those five years has never been surpassed. Too much was exacted from him, but he ought not to have gone off as soon as he did. He began to lose efficiency before he was 28, and though for a year or two longer he did brilliant things he was never again his old self. A great increase in weight rather than hard work was responsible for his comparatively early decline. Looking at the matter in the light of after events, it was no doubt a misfortune that he paid a second visit to Australia. When in the autumn of 1897 he went out with Mr Stoddart's second team, he was at the top of his fame, having just completed a wonderful season's bowling. In English first-class cricket in 1897 he took 273 wickets for less than 14½ runs each. One remembers that when Mr Stoddart's team sailed from Tilbury, Maurice Read was full of forebodings as to the effect the tour might have on Richardson's future, thinking that a winter's rest after his strenuous labours would have been far better for him than Test matches on Australian wickets. After Richardson came home his falling off was plain for all to see. He took 161 wickets in first-class matches in 1898, but his bowling had lost its superlative quality, and only in two or three matches at the end of the season - notably against Warwickshire at The Oval - was he the old Richardson of the previous year. He continued to assist Surrey for several seasons, playing for the county for the last time in 1904. After that he lived for a time at  Bath and appeared once at least in the Somerset XI, but he had become bulky in figure, and his day for serious cricket was over. \n"", 'In his prime Richardson had every good quality that a fast bowler can possess. Lithe and supple in figure he combined with his splendid physique an inexhaustible energy. While he kept his weight down to reasonable limits no day was too long for him. There have been faster bowlers - WN Powys, 40 years ago, and CJ Kortright and Ernest Jones, the Australian, in our own day - but for sustained pace through a long innings he perhaps never had an equal. Pace, however, was only one of his virtues. It was his pronounced offbreak in combination with great speed that made him so irresistible. He took a long run up to the wicket and kept his hand very high at the moment of delivery. Purely a fast bowler, he did nearly all his best work on dry, run-getting wickets. A firm foothold was so essential to him, that he was far less effective after heavy rain than offbreak bowlers of less pace, such as Spofforth and Charles Turner. Still, when the ground was dry on the surface and soft underneath he could be very deadly. One recalls a Surrey and Notts match at The Oval that began under these conditions. Mr JA Dixon won the toss for Notts and, as it happened practically lost the game before luncheon. Richardson on that August Bank Holiday was literally unplayable, fizzing off the pitch and breaking back five or six inches at his full pace.', ""As regards sustained excellence Richardson never did anything better than his wonderful effort in the last innings of the England v Australia match at Manchester in 1896. After having made England follow on the Australians were left with 125 to get to win. They won the match by three wickets, but it took them three hours to get the runs. It was said at the time that during those three hours Richardson did not send down one really bad ball. He took six wickets and would have won the game if Briggs and Hearne had given any effective help. In the Test match at Lord's in the same season he did one of his finest performances, he and George Lohmann getting the Australians out for a total of 53. Richardson in that innings bowled 11 overs and three balls for 39 runs and six wickets. As contradictory statements have been made on the point, it is only right to say that at the outset of his career the fairness of Richardson's delivery gave rise to a great deal of discussion. When he came out for Surrey in 1892 his action was condemned by, among others, the late WL Murdoch, and when in the Whit Monday match at Trent Bridge in 1893 he gained for Surrey an easy victory over Notts, half the Notts XI expressed a positive opinion that he threw his very fast ball. However, he soon learned to straighten his arm, and little or nothing more in the way of adverse criticism was heard. Like a wise man, Richardson in his great days treated himself as a bowler pure and simple. He once scored 60 against Gloucestershire at The Oval, but he never took his batting seriously. His business was to get wickets and, with that end in view, he kept himself fresh, seldom staying in long enough to discount his bowling. He was one of the pre-eminent cricketers of his generation.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1897'],14.0,24,8,177.0,25*,11.06,,,0,0,,0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,358.0,479,124,3424,69,9.64,,,0,2,,,126.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14.0,24,4498,2220,88.0,8/94,13/244,25.22,2.96,51.1,1,11,4,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,358.0,,78992,38793,2104,10/45,,18.43,2.94,37.5,,200,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

For Yorkshire he scored more than 30,000 runs, averaging 30 an innings; for Yorkshire he took 3,597 wickets at 16 runs each. When he was not playing for Yorkshire, in his spare time, so to say, he played for England and amassed 2,000 runs, average 30, and took 127 wickets, at the cost of 26.96 apiece. In his first Test match he was last in the batting order, and at Sydney in the 1903-04 rubber he took part in the most persistent and prolific Test match last-wicket partnership to this day; he helped RE Foster to add 130 for the tenth wicket, his share 40 not out. Eight years afterwards he went in first for England at Melbourne, and against Australia he was the partner of Hobbs in the record first-wicket stand of 323. \n"", ""His career is already legendary; it does indeed read like a fairy tale. He was not 21 years old when he first bowled for Yorkshire in a match against MCC at  Lord's. In the first innings he accounted for Trott and Chatteron; in the second, Trott,  Chatteron, CP Foley, and the Hon JR Tufton -- six wickets for 63, a modest beginning, true. But at the season's end he had established himself as the greatest slow left-hand bowler in England with 154 wickets, average 14.60."", ""During the period in which Rhodes and Hobbs opened every England innings by prescriptive right, Rhodes put aside his bowling. In the Australian rubber of 1911-12 he contributed only 18 overs. But then the war came, reducing the Yorkshire attack. In  1919 Yorkshire needed again the spin and flight of Rhodes, so he picked up his bowling arts exactly where years before he had laid them down, picked them up as though he had not lost touch for a moment. He headed the bowling averages of 1919, 164 wickets, average 14.42 in 1048 overs. He was nearly 42 by the calendar. In 1902 he had gone in last for England at The Kennington Oval when 15 runs were wanted to beat Australia; George Hirst, with whom he always opened Yorkshire's attack, was holding the wicket at the other end. England won by one wicket."", 'Twenty-four years afterwards, Rhodes in his forty-ninth year was recalled to the England XI and was one of the main causes of Australia\'s defeat and  England\'s emergence from years in the wilderness. On this, his last appearance for England, Rhodes took the wickets of Woodfull, Ponsford, Richardson (twice), Collins, and Bardsley for 79 runs. He had probably lost by then much of his old quick vitally fingered spin: but as he explained to me: ""If batsmen thinks as I\'m spinnin\' them, then I am"" -- a remark metaphysical, maybe, but to the point. At Sydney, in December 1903, on the shirt-fronted polished Bulli soil pitches of that distant halcyon day for batsmen, Australia scored 485, and the might of Australia\'s champions commanded the crease -- Trumper, Hill, Duff, Armstrong, Gregory. Rhodes bowled 48 overs for 94 runs, five wickets. It was on this occasion that Trumper, the most brilliant of all batsmen, alive or dead, made his famous remark to Rhodes -- ""for God\'s sake, Wilfred, give me a minute\'s rest.""', ""Rhodes could not turn the ball on the Australian grounds of half a century ago. He prevailed by length, variations of flight, but chiefly by unceasing accuracy of pitch, always demanding close attention from the batsman, the curving arc through the air, the ball dropping on the same spot over by over, yet not on quite the same spot, each over in collusion with the rest, every ball a decoy, some balls apparently guileless, some artfully masked -- and one of them, sooner or later, the master ball. He was economical in action, a few short strides, then a beautifully balanced sideways swing of the body, the arm loose and making a lovely arch. He could go on for hours; the rhythm of his action was in its easy rotation, hypnotic, lulling his victims to the tranced state in which he could work his will, make them perform strokes contrary to their reason and intention. Batsmen of Rhodes's heyday frequently succumbed to his bait for a catch in the deepfield.  David Denton had safe hands at long-on; and the score-sheets of the period repeated day by day the rubric -- c Denton b Rhodes. In rainy weather, c Tunnicliffe b Rhodes was familiar proof that  Wilfred was at work on a  sticky pitch, for Tunnicliffe was the best slip fielder of the century, a long giant with a reach into infinity."", 'Rhodes really was a slow bowler, not quick and low flight to the pitch, after Lock\'s manner. At the end of his career he proudly maintained that ""Ah were never hooked and Ah were never cut,"" a pardonable exaggeration considering the proportion of truth in it. Rhodes seldom pitched short. ""Best ball on a `sticky\' pitch is a spinnin\' half-volley,"" such was his doctrine. And he bowled to his field with the precision of high mathematics. Ernest Tyldesley once told me that he often had no alternative but to play at least three balls an over, on a batsman\'s wicket, straight to mid-off, an inch off the spot where Rhodes had planted mid-off.', ""Rhodes made himself into a batsman by practice and hard thinking. He was one of the first batsmen to adopt the full-fronted stance, left shoulder pointing to forward leg. But it is a mistake to suppose that his batting was perpetually dour and parsimonious in strokeplay. In the Test match against the Australians at Lord's in 1912, England had first innings on a rain-damaged pitch.  "", ' relates that Rhodes, with Hobbs as company, so monopolised the hitting that his share of 77 runs amounted to 52. On the whole and naturally enough, Rhodes distrusted the romantic gesture. One day in conversation with him, I deplored the absence in modern cricket of the cut. ""But it were never a business stroke,"" he maintained.', 'While he was actively engaged in the game he was not a man given to affability. He was known as a natterer on the field; and to natter in the North of England means to talk naggingly, most to oneself, with the intention of being overheard. At Old Trafford in the 1930s Lancashire reached a total of 500 against Yorkshire. The Lancashire captain, Leonard Green, was about to take the bowling of Rhodes when the score was 499. Green was sure in his mind that a total of 500 would never again, or not for decades, be achieved by Lancashire against Yorkshire. He therefore determined that come what may, he would himself score the five hundredth run. So he blocked a ball from Rhodes, then ran like the wind. The ball was picked up by Emmott Robinson at silly-point, and hurled to the bowler\'s end, where it struck Rhodes on the wrist even as Green got home by the skin of his teeth. And in all the scurry and excitement Wilfred was heard to mutter, while he retrieved Robinson\'s violent throw, ""There\'s somebody runnin\' up and down this wicket. Ah don\'t know who it is, but there\'s somebody runnin\' up and down this wicket.""', 'He was a great player, one of the greatest of cricket\'s history, not only for his allround performances denoted by the statisticians: nearly 40,000 runs scored in 37 seasons and 4,184 wickets taken. He was great because his cricket was redolent and representative of Yorkshire county. In his old age he lost his eyesight and found his tongue. He accepted his affliction philosophically, and consoled himself by a flow of genial chatter never before heard from him. He attended cricket as long as health would permit. With an acquired sense he was able to follow the play. ""He\'s middlin\' the ball right."" But it was his delight in his last years to recall the old days. I asked him what he thought of Ranjitsinhji. ""He were a good bat were `Ranji.\' But I always fancied myself getting him leg before doin\' that leg glance of his."" I tried again.  What did you think of Trumper? ""\'E were a good bat were Victor."" There was no advance on a good bat in Wilfred\'s vocabulary of praise. Once, though, he let himself go. I asked him his opinion of Sidney Barnes as a bowler. ""The best of \'em today is half as good as Barnie."" He intended this as a compliment to the champions of today.', ""I last saw him as his daughter, Muriel, and her husband Tom Burnley, led him out of  Trent Bridge at the close of play of a Test match. More than fifty years ago he had first played for England, on this same ground, in 1899, when he was 21. Now he was going home to Canford Cliffs, Bournemouth, white stick in hand, arm in arm with his son-in-law, his face ruddy after hours sitting and listening to cricket, and whether he knew it or not, himself a permanent part of the game's history and traditions.

In 1884 he scored 567 runs for Notts in thirteen matches, with an average of 31.9; in 1885, 442 runs in fourteen engagements, with an average of 22.2; and in 1886, in county fixtures only, 559 runs, with an average of 29.8. Though he several times made higher scores, his finest performance was undoubtedly his innings of 90 for England against Australia at Kennington Oval in August, 1884. The match, as cricket readers will readily remember, resulted in a draw, Australia scoring 551 and England 346 and 85 for two wickets. In England""s first innings Scotton went in first, and was the ninth man out, the total when he left being 332. During a stay of five hours and three quarters he played the bowling of Spofforth, Palmer, Boyle, Midwinter, and George Giffen without giving the slightest chance, and but for his impregnable defence it is quite likely that England would have been beaten. Up to a certain time he received very little assistance, but when W. W. Read joined him, 151 runs were put on for the ninth wicket. Against the Australian team of 1886 Scotton played two remarkable innings in company with Mr. W. G. Grace, the two batsmen scoring 170 together for the first wicket for England at the Oval, and 156 for Lord Londesborough""s Eleven at Scarborough. Scotton""s score at the Oval was only 34, but at Scarborough he made 71. Scotton paid three visits to Australia, going out with Shaw and Shrewsbury""s teams in 1881, 1884, and 1886. In the three tours he averaged respectively in the eleven a-side matches, 20.8, 17.3, and 10.13. Few left-handed men have ever played with so straight a bat or possessed such a strong defence, but he carried caution to such extremes that it was often impossible to take any pleasure in seeing him play.']",[],15.0,25,2,510.0,90,22.17,,,0,3,,0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,237.0,377,33,6527,134,18.97,,,4,23,,,122.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,1,20,20,0.0,-,-,35.33,6.00,-,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,237.0,,765,410,8,1/7,,51.25,3.21,95.6,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

W. Read died on Sunday, January 6th, at his residence, Colworth Road, Addiscombe Park. More than nine years have passed away since Mr. Read dropped out of the Surrey eleven and gave up first-class cricket, but his wonderful play during a long career is vividly remembered. Beyond question he was one of the greatest batsmen the game has known, holding a high place among those nearest in merit to W. G. Grace. Born on November 23rd, 1855, he was in his fifty-second year. He had been in poor health for some little time, but his illness did not assume a dangerous form until a week before his death. \n', 'While still quite a lad Mr. Read showed extreme promise as a batsman in local cricket at Reigate, and soon came under the notice of the Surrey committee, with the result that he was given his first trial for the county before he was eighteen, playing against Yorkshire at The Oval in the season of 1873. He was put to rather a severe test against the bowling of Hill and Tom Emmett, but, though he scored only 3 and 14, his form was so good that no doubt could be felt as to his ultimate success. At the outset of his career, and for some years afterwards, he assisted his father as a schoolmaster at Reigate, and could only spare time to play for Surrey in the latter part of the summer. Still, though his opportunities were restricted, he steadily improved, and in 1877 he took his place among the best batsmen of his day, playing an innings of 140 against Yorkshire at The Oval, and, with the late Henry Jupp as his partner, sending up 206 for the first wicket.', ""The turning point of his cricket life came in 1881, when an appointment as assistant secretary at The Oval enabled him to devote all his life to the game. From that year until his powers began to wane he was, as a batsman, the mainstay of the Surrey eleven. In the revival of Surrey cricket, which began in 1883, he and the late George Lohmann had the chief share. They, far more than anyone else, enabled Surrey, under Mr. John Shuter's captaincy, to recover in 1887, after an interval of twenty-three years, the first position among the counties. The success was uninterrupted till the breakdown of Lohmann's health after the summer of 1892, and, with only one moderate season, went on until after Mr. Read himself had retired, Surrey winning the championship for the last time in 1889. In the meantime, Mr. Shuter, compelled by business to give up first-class cricket, was succeeded as captain by Mr. K. J. Key."", 'Mr. Read was perhaps at his very best as a batsman during the seasons of 1885, 1886, 1887 and 1888. It was a little earlier, however, that he played the innings of his life - his memorable 117 for England against Australia, at The Oval, in August, 1884. England had a magnificent eleven, and Mr. Read, though he ought to have gone in earlier, was tenth on the batting order. In ordinary circumstances he would not have had much chance of distinction, but Scotton, who had gone in first and was firmly set, kept up such an impregnable defence that the ninth wicket added 151 runs, England drawing the game in the face of a total by Australia of 551. The way in which Mr. Read that afternoon punished the bowling of Spofforth, Palmer, Giffen, and Midwinter, will never be forgotten by those fortunate enough to be present. His innings ranks among the finest ever played in Test matches, and after the lapse of twenty-two years it is still constantly talked about.', ""His highest score in first-class cricket was 338 for Surrey against Oxford University at The Oval in 1888. In 1887, however, he did something even more remarkable than this, making two scores of over 200 in successive matches - 247 for Surrey against Lancashire at Manchester, and 244 (not out) for Surrey against Cambridge University at The Oval. After 1888 his play fell off to some extent, but he recovered his form, and in 1892 he was again one of the most successful of batsmen. He remained one of Surrey's chief run-getters for some time longer, but his powers gradually declined, and in 1897, as I have already stated, he dropped out of the eleven. Of his doings for Surrey during his long career it would be an easy matter to write a column. As a match-winner, the county never had a better batsman. He was a wonderfully punishing player, with tremendous power in his off-drive."", 'More forward in style than most of the great batsmen of the present time, he was seen at his best on true, lively wickets, but he came off under all conditions of ground and weather. Among many fine innings that he played, I recall in particular one on a frightfully rough wicket at Derby, when the ball was getting up shoulder high. In his young days Mr. Read could be described as an orthodox player, depending as he did on his driving and the perfect straightness of his bat; but as time went on he developed a great fondness for pulling. He carried the pull to a higher pitch than anyone else in his day, but from being a good servant the stroke became, to some extent, his master, and impaired his batting. That, at least, was the opinion of Mr. Shuter, than whom he had no warmer admirer.', ""Mr. Read played regularly in the England and Australia matches in this country, from 1884 to 1893, only missing, if I remember rightly, two matches during that period. Next to his 117 in 1884 his best score in the series of games was 94 at The Oval in 1886. He finished up well, making 52 at The Oval match of 1893. In Gentlemen v. Players matches he was not so conspicuously successful as some other batsmen of his class, but he made 159 at The Oval in 1885, and had an average of 28 in forty-one innings. He went twice to Australia, first with the eleven captained by the Hon. Ivo Bligh (now Lord Darnley) in the winter of 1882-83, and afterwards with the late Mr. G. F. Vernon's team, 1887-88. In the latter tour he was easily first in batting in the eleven-a-side matches, scoring 592 runs, with an average of 65, but he did not play consistently, owing his position entirely to three long innings. Mr. Read was pre-eminently a batsman, but he bowled lobs at times with no small amount of success, and was a very good, safe field at point. He had for the last two years acted as coach to the young players at The Oval.

He played for 15 seasons before, at the age of 36 and after a season in which he had scored 1031 runs at 31, he retired to take an appointment on the Tichborne Park estate. Read made his debut for Surrey in 1880 and immediately won a regular place in the side as a hard-hitting batsman, an occasional fast bowler and an excellent specialist third man.  The Surrey side at that time was strong - they won five Championships in six seasons - and for almost a decade Read was also a fixture in the England team, making four tours to Australia and playing in early Tests in South Africa.  Read was also immensely popular with both team-mates and the public, and he was instrumental in changing the perception of the professional cricketer from being slightly rough and ready to that of a skilled artist.  A mark of his standing was that the Oval Test against Australia in 1893 was awarded to him as a benefit match.  He bowed out with 131 in his last innings for Surrey, and thereafter plundered thousands of runs off sides visiting the  Tichborne Park estate, averaging over 100 almost every season until his late middle-age, including double hundreds against Incogniti and Royal Navy.

From an early age, he quickly established himself as the tidiest gloveman in English cricket. But life as a wicketkeeping purist was no longer any guarantee of success by the time his career reached fulfilment and, even more than Jack Russell before him, he soon realised that England honours would not come easily.  He played 15 Tests and 36 ODIs for England between 1999 and 2007 before his career faltered on the rock known as Duncan Fletcher - England's coach at the time felt he was too undemonstrative as a keeper and a batsman overly committed to attack - but many admirers campaigned for his selection long after England had decided to look elsewhere. \n"", ""Not that Read was a poor batsman - far from it. He averaged 18.94 in Tests, but doubled that in the first-class game. A back-foot fighter with a productive whip-pull, he batted as high as No. 6 in the Nottinghamshire middle order and at one of the more treacherous batting venues in the country, he was often charged with walking out at Trent Bridge to avert a collapse with an individualistic mix of enterprise and batting gumption. It became one of county cricket's great sights."", 'Nothing encapsulated Read more than the manner of his parting. He had retired from the limited-overs game (Nottinghamshire won both trophies in his absence) but there was still a promotion to win in the final game of the Championship season in 2017. Midway through that game at Hove, disaster threatened. At 56 for 5, with Sussex\'s first innings of 565 light years away, defeat was looming. Read and Billy Root responded with centuries, the match was drawn and the eulogies could be written without any sense of regret. ""A magical season,"" he said as he reflected on a career that brought more than county records as a wicketkeeper, more than 16,000 first-class runs, just over 7,000 in limited-overs formats and considerable pleasure for all who watched him.', ""Almost two decades earlier, the emphasis was on England. When Read was picked by England against New Zealand in 1999, he infamously ducked into a Chris Cairns slower ball which he lost above the Lord's sightscreen. He made the one-day team that winter in South Africa and, despite a below-par performance behind the stumps, showed composure with the bat, memorably mowing Shaun Pollock for six to reignite a run-chase."", ""Read lost ground after his debut, dropping behind rivals such as Paul Nixon, strangely, and then James Foster, initially championed by the England coach at the time, Duncan Fletcher, in the race to become England's next keeper. But he was a more rounded player by the time Alec Stewart finally hung up his gloves in 2003. He duly returned to the top of the pile and, after an immaculate time behind the stumps in the Caribbean, he was controversially dropped in favour of another Fletcher hunch - Geraint Jones, a better batsman, although arguably not by much. Two months later, and Read had been axed from the one-day side as well, despite some combative performances low down the order."", ""He remained on the fringes of the team and an impressive unbeaten 150 for England A against the Pakistanis in July 2006 finally convinced the management that he was due another chance. A brisk 55 in his comeback Test against Pakistan, in the 3rd Test at Headingley, demonstrated a cricketer with far greater confidence in himself than in his youth. In a Fletcher-inspired see-saw, he was again left out for the 2006-07 Ashes before Jones's loss of form meant he was recalled for the last two Tests."", ""But Nixon edged him out for the one-day series that followed, and the emergence of Peter Moores as Fletcher's successor and the selection of Matt Prior meant Read slipped gently down the list of keepers. Craig Kieswetter's emergence provided another favoured alternative and put paid to any hopes that Read might be able to add to his 52 England caps."", ""If England proved unfaithful suitors, he remained a vital part of Nottinghamshire's squad. As he entered his 30s, in spite of taking on the extra demands of captaincy at Trent Bridge, he found a golden run of form that saw him average 42.06 in 2008, and rise to become Nottinghamshire's leading run-scorer by some distance in 2009, with 1203 runs at 75.18, including four hundreds, as the county finished as Division One runners-up. That he had found a mode of batting when England honours were no longer likely became more apparent with every passing season. In 2015, now 37, his average topped 50 and he even headed Notts' batting averages. His England exclusion felt more premature than ever."", ""Such analyses are worth listing in detail because they communicate how run-scoring had suddenly become part of his game. He was a respected captain, too, although at the end of a challenging 2013 season for Notts, in which they avoided relegation none too surely and won the YB40 final, he conceded the one-day captaincy to James Taylor who as a result was identified as Notts' potential captain-in-waiting if his own England career did not go according to plan.\n"", '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 1997'],15.0,23,4,360.0,55,18.94,912,39.47,0,1,36,4,48.0,6.0,36.0,24,7,300.0,30*,17.64,410,73.17,0,0,21,6,41.0,2.0,1.0,1,0,13.0,13,13.00,11,118.18,0,0,2,0,1.0,0.0,349.0,526,87,16361,240,37.26,,,26,92,,,1051.0,53.0,333.0,265,74,5564,135,29.13,,,2,24,,,319.0,73.0,119.0,98,36,1441,58*,23.24,1160,124.22,0,1,106,38,60.0,27.0,15.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,36.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,1.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,349.0,,96,90,0,-,-,-,5.62,-,0,0,0,333.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,119.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

When it is a young legspinner the hype is magnified. When it is a young spinner of Pakistani extraction, brought up in Yorkshire, the sense of excitement becomes palpable. Adil Rashid, the player who above all symbolized Yorkshire's growing success in fostering strong relationships in its minority ethnic communities, burst onto the scene with six wickets against Warwickshire on his first-class debut in 2006 at Scarborough. There was a sense in Yorkshire's much-loved seaside town that afternoon as Rashid cut through Warwickshire that a historic breakthrough had been made and more than one Yorkshire supporter observed Rashid's performance with hearts uplifted. \n"", 'A decade later, as he left a tour of India in which England had been trounced 4-0, it was still occasionally possible to see the vulnerable, taciturn 18-year-old of whom Yorkshire were so protective. Rashid had 10 Test caps, all of them in the UAE or South Asia where England needed a second spinner, but even on such surfaces he needed careful handling in case his leg spin succumbed under the pressure. He seemed happiest in limited-overs cricket where the game unfolded in a more predictable fashion and he knew that batsmen would be committed to attack. It was hard to imagine him as a single spinner in England unless he became more serviceable, but such had been remarked of countless legspinners before him.', ""A five-wicket haul on debut against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi after a return of 0 for plenty in the first innings augured well (setting up a short run chase which England narrowly failed to achieve) and he also brushed up well a year later in Dhaka at the start of England's 2016-17 tour of Bangladesh and India. His India series gradually took a turn for the worse, however, the promise of Rajkot and Visakhapatnam giving way to a more pessimistic air - and some hefty figures in the runs column - in Mumbai and Chennai. He had the ability to hoover up a tail at both England and county level; sometimes the problem was getting to it."", ""In the limited-overs formats, Rashid was a vital component of England's attack and a first-class average with the bat in the mid-30s told of a player who would not have been consigned to the tail in many England XIs in the past."", ""Rashid's also caught the eye early in his career for England Under-19s nd an eight-wicket haul during the second Test against India. But he suffered a stress fracture in his back in the close season which forced him to remodel his action. His profile rose further in 2007 when he struck his maiden Championship century against Worcestershire in August and at the end of the season the Cricket Writers' Club made him their Young Cricketer of the Year. In 2008 he enjoyed his most prolific season with 62 wickets in the County Championship and was a late addition to the squad for the Test series in India. That trip was purely for experience, however, as was the tour to West Indies which followed, but even so his career shone with potential."", 'Rashid responded the following season with 545 runs at 68.12, including two hundreds, and picked up 31 wickets at 36.06 in the 2009 first-class season. His statistics in one-day and Twenty20 cricket were more modest, but the selectors held faith in his potential, and he made his England debut during the World Twenty in June of that year. He also played in the post-Ashes one-day series against Australia, but his most notable achievement came with the bat when he scored a quickfire 31 in a narrow defeat at The Oval.', 'Rashid was included in the party to tour South Africa in 2009-10, but had a difficult time on the trip. He began amid high hopes that his combination of legspin and promising lower-order batting could cement a permanent role in the side, but his solitary over in the second Twenty20 went for 25, then he bowled three overs for 27 in the second ODI before being left out for a fit-again Graeme Swann. When he was released from the one-day party, James Tredwell, the Kent offspinner, remained on stand-by which suggested Rashid had fallen down the pecking order. ', ""Andy Flower, England's coach, rightly suggested that he would benefit from a chance to deepen his game at county level, but progress was not immediate. Yorkshire, by now, were showing signs of disquiet over Rashid's bowling. England had demanded that he bowled much quicker and his confidence and method had deserted him when he returned from international duty. His county form faltered, although he did win a place in the England Lions squad to tour UAE and was called-up briefly for the end of the World Cup campaign."", 'At home, Rashid enjoyed his most productive season for Yorkshire in 2010, scoring 732 first-class runs at 45.75 and taking 57 wickets at 31.29. He began the 2011 season with a bang, taking 6 for 77 and 5 for 37 to secure victory against Worcestershire at New Road, the best figures for a leg-spinner in Yorkshire history, but failed to maintain his form, finishing the season with 39 wickets at 43.38. From 10 Championship matches in 2012 he totalled only 16 wickets and 129 runs and his discontent was apparent. ', ""Rashid was at a crossroads. But more than 800 Championship runs at 50-plus in 2013 suggested that in his mid-20s not just his batting was maturing, and his bowling became more thoughtful, and dangerous in turn with a good googly particularly evident. Yorkshire's challenge was to bring his career to fruition, to bring him not just success on the field but a general contentment. A career that had begun with so much optimism began to reawaken England's interest again - cagily at first with a Lions recall - as Yorkshire won the title in 2014. The appointment of Trevor Bayliss as coach coincided with his return to the England side for the first time in nearly six years, a string of limited-overs displays being joined by limited success in his first three Tests, against Pakistan on the slow, big turners of the UAE."", 'He was a much-loved figure on Yorkshire grounds, contributing to back-to-back Championships in 2014 and 15, and dubbed ""The Hoover"" by the head coach Jason Gillespie. But his request to rest out a title decider against Middlesex at Lord\'s the following year - he later explained that his grandmother was unwell - exasperated his captain, Andrew Gale.

His keen eye, unorthodoxy and speed of reaction meant that introduced the late cut and leg glance, as well as the art of back-foot defence.   He arrived at Cambridge in 1891 (where he acquired the nickname ""Smith"") never having played an organised game and won a Blue in his final summer.   After serving his qualification, he marked his debut for Sussex at Lord\'s in May 1895 with 77 and 150 against MCC. On his Test debut against Australia, at Old Trafford in 1896, he scored 62 and 154 not out.   From 1895 he exceeded 1000 runs in 10 successive seasons, passing 3000 in 1899 and 1900.  He was as prolific overseas, scoring 1157 runs at 60.89 on his one trip to Australia in 1897-98.  In that Golden Age his name was synonymous with Sussex and his close friend, CB Fry.  He led the county for five years (1899-1903) but at the end of 1904 he returned to India to deal with increasing domestic responsibilities, and played only two more complete summers (1908 and 1912), again passing 1000 runs each time.

But even then the picture tells nothing of the astonishing agility of ""Arkle"": a split-second earlier, as the ball screeched overhead, he had been on his haunches three feet clear of any danger. A hyperactive cover fieldsman, who was often actually galloping in  as the bowler reached the crease, Randall, in a day\'s fielding, habitually saved 20 runs through quicksilver interceptions and the safe singles his mobility inhibited. As a batsman he was in David Gower\'s class when it came to timing a cover-drive, but he was a twitchy starter, especially when there was movement for the seamers, and was at his most effective at No. 5 or 6. ', ' \n', '\nIt was said of Derek Randall that he could catch swallows. Watching him\npatrolling the covers, you could almost believe it. It was his anticipation\nand speed over the ground rather than strength of arm that made him such a\nwonderful fielder - he would often run batsmen out simply by outpacing them\nto the wicket and whipping off the bails. With Randall on one side of the\nwicket and David Gower on the other, few batsmen chanced quick singles\nagainst England.', 'But there was more to Randall than his fielding. There was his\nspectacular, eccentric batting too. His Test record of 2,470 runs in 47\nmatches at an average of just over 33 betrays a lack of consistency, but\nwhen he was good, he was very, very good. There was his match-winning knock\nat Sydney in 1978-79 when, with England trailing after the first innings by 142\nruns, Randall held the second innings together with a magnificent 150. But\nthat was against an Australian side depleted by the Packer ban. On a\ndifferent plain altogether was his 174 in 1977 in the Centenary Test against\na strong Australia side at Melbourne. With England chasing an improbable 463\nto win, Randall took them unbelievably close - doffing his cap to the mighty\nDennis Lillee in the process after just evading a bouncer - but in the end\ntheir valiant chase fell 46 runs short.', ""Randall, known as Arkle after the racehorse, was seldom far from the\ndrama. His lightning run-out of Rick McCosker in the Test when England\nclinched the Ashes at Headingley in 1977 amazed all who witnessed it. And in\nthe previous Test at his home ground of Trent Bridge he had been\nridiculously run out himself, stranded by Geoffrey Boycott at the other end.\nBoycott went on to make amends by hitting his 99th first-class century,\nfollowed by his 100th at Leeds in the next game. In the one-day game,\nRandall's fielding came even more to the fore and he became a one-day\nregular, playing in the World Cup Final defeat at the hands of the West\nIndies at Lord's in 1979."", ""In Randall's Nottinghamshire career, which lasted from 1972 to 1983, he\nhit 1,000 runs in a season eight times and scored two double centuries.

Sixty-six times they posted a three-figures stand, including the towering 428 against Oxford University in 1926: yet the spotlight remained fixed to Hobbs, even when he failed and Sandham made runs. \n', 'From this it might be assumed that Andy Sandham was a mute No. 2. Some of his accomplishments argue otherwise. He once held the world Test record, making the First Test triple-century when he was in his 40th year, a 10-hour innings of 325 at Kingston, Jamaica, when England piled up 849 off the West Indies bowling. ', ""Sandham had to borrow his captain's long-handled bat and Hendren's shoes (which occasionally slipped off as he scuttled a single); and when England batted again, he went in at No. 7 and made 50. His match aggregate of 375 was a Test record until Greg Chappell beat it at Wellington 44 years and 543 Tests later."", 'Just before his 45th birthday, in 1935, the year of his second benefit, Sandham became the tenth batsman to score 100 centuries, turning the ball for two - ""I\'ll always remember that stroke"" - against Hampshire at Basingstoke. He finished with 107 centuries, including one in his last match for Surrey, at Hove in 1937. Ever neat, he finished with exactly 1,000 innings in first-class cricket, which produced 41,284 runs at an average of 44.83. Twice he came close to 300 for the county, retiring ill on 282 at Old Trafford in 1928 and being gently annoyed when Percy Fender declared overnight when he was 292 against Northants at the Oval in 1921.', 'Sandham was born in Streatham on July 6, 1890, and made his Surrey debut in 1911. In the years to come he established himself as one of the most trusty batsmen, but not as a Test player. Hobbs was an England fixture, and soon after the First World War, Sutcliffe made the other opening berth his own. Thus Sandham won a mere 14 caps, only three of them against Australia. ', 'Apart from his 325 he made 152 against West Indies at Bridgetown in the First Test of the 1929-30 series, which left him with the respectable Test average of 38.21; but his Ashes innings were all doomed to failure. By way of consolation, he is the only batsman to score a double-century for a county against the Australians; and he did score two centuries in a match for MCC against NSW.', '""A sort of exponent of judo-batsmanship"" was how Denzil Batchelor described him. He was not large enough to bang the ball about. He was a \'touch\' player, gliding and steering the ball, or flicking a bouncer off his eyebrows. Robertson-Glasgow saw him as ""primarily the servant of his art and his team, only secondarily the entertainer of the public"". ', ""He learned much from watching Tom Hayward in the early days, and it almost goes without saying that to bat with Hobbs every day was, for an observant man, a richly rewarding experience. Their running of lighting singles, born of almost telepathic understanding, was one of the game's pre-war joys."", ""Apart from the 428 against Oxford, Sandham's name remains beside two other Surrey partnership records: 298 for the sixth, and 173 for the tenth, when he went in last man at Leyton in 1921, having been sick after lunch. Ducat made 290 not out, Sandham 58 in 100 minutes. "", 'He toured South Africa twice, India, West Indies and Australia once, and had several private tours, unobtrusively and modestly representing his country, tucking away runs, fleet-footed in the deep-field, the model professional. ', "" When it was all over he became Surrey's coach, feeling a profound pride during the seven successive Championship seasons of the 1950s; and then he became the club's scorer."", ""With his sight failing, he spent his last years not far from Lord's, his 325 bat in the corner of his room. He was lured to the Centenary Test in 1980, when he responded to questioning with typically kindly recollections. The long run-ups of modern fast bowlers bored him, and he said so gently.

A star for Middlesex at 17, he captained England Under-19. But his international career became a monument to England selection policies of the period, with five distinct phases: adhesive beginner (1991), nervous wreck capable of shining only as a stand-in (1992-97), solid achiever lacking only a top gear (1997-99), blatant scapegoat (1999-2000) and seasoned spare part (2001-02). A better player abroad, he has been selected twice as often at home. Only David Lloyd, with his tender loving cheer, got the best out of him. Oddly, he always did well against Australia, averaging 42. His stylish 133 against them at the Oval in 2001, his first Test century in England, felt like a breakthrough, but turned out to be a swansong as Nasser Hussain and Duncan Fletcher lost patience after an indifferent tour of India and New Zealand. All along, he has been a fielder of world class at cover and bat-pad, and a county run-machine. When England gave up on him, he became even more prolific for Surrey: in 2006, his 20th county season, he was Bradmanesque, scoring 2,278 runs and averaging over 100.  That remarkable form continued, and at county level he was head and shoulders above his peers. His only (relative) lean patch came in 2008 when he was marooned on 99 first-class hundreds, but when the 100th came - and he may well be the last man to reach that number - the floodgates again opened.  In the winter of 2006-07 he astonished team-mates and fans by taking part in ', "", the BBC TV reality show which had been won the previous year by the much more extrovert Darren Gough. Ramprakash finally did what he hadn't done for England: he conquered his nerves, came out of his shell and rose to the big occasion, scoring a perfect 40 (10/10 from all four judges) for his salsa in the final. And he did it in a range of slinky shirts with not many buttons done up. \n"", ' January 2009\n \n']","['PCA Player of the Year 2006', 'Awarded the MBE on 29th Dec 2012']",52.0,92,6,2350.0,154,27.32,6495,36.18,2,12,251,7,39.0,0.0,18.0,18,4,376.0,51,26.85,544,69.11,0,1,22,5,8.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,461.0,764,93,35659,301*,53.14,,,114,147,,,261.0,0.0,407.0,394,64,13273,147*,40.22,,,17,85,,,137.0,0.0,63.0,63,10,1719,85*,32.43,1375,125.01,0,13,146,60,21.0,0.0,52.0,25,895,477,4.0,1/2,1/2,119.25,3.19,223.7,0,0,0,18.0,5,132,108,4.0,3/28,3/28,27.0,4.90,33.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,461.0,,4177,2202,34,3/32,,64.76,3.16,122.8,,0,0,407.0,,1734,1354,46,5/38,5/38,29.43,4.68,37.6,0,1,0,63.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

But he remains determined and likeable, and his batting, a mixture of well-organised defence and well-timed drives, is comfortably above the tailender category. Salisbury left Sussex for Surrey in time for the 1997 season, and prospered on the bouncier wickets. And in 1999-2000 he was player of the year in Sydney's grade-cricket competition.

On the morning of his death he was putting on his boots before going to his business at Deansgate, Manchester, when he collapsed and died. He had carried on his duties as coach at Old Trafford until the end of last summer. Born at Roe Green, Worsley, on November 22, 1873, he was just 57 years of age at the time of his death. Tyldesley received his early training in Lancashire club cricket -- a very stiff school -- and was a well equipped batsman when he first appeared for Lancashire in 1895. In his second match he scored 152 not out against Warwickshire on the Edgbaston ground -- the scene of many triumphs for him in subsequent years. He did nothing else of much note that summer -- he was not given a trial until the middle of July -- but two years later he made over 1,000 runs, and he achieved that performance for nineteen consecutive seasons. Four times he scored over 2,000 runs, and in 1901 he had an aggregate of 3,041, his innings including nine separate centuries, eight of which were made for Lancashire, and his average being 55. In two seasons -- 1897 and 1904 -- he played three successive innings of a hundred, and on three occasions he made two separate hundreds in the same match. These scores were 106 and 100 not out for Lancashire against Warwickshire in 1897, 121 and 100 not out in a North and South match in 1900, and 136 and 101 for  Lancashire against Hampshire in 1910. His highest innings -- all for his county -- were: \n"", ""Altogether in the course of his brilliant career he scored 37,803 runs in first-class matches with an average of nearly 41, and made eighty-six separate centuries. He played frequently in  Gentlemen v. Players matches and in 1901 made 140 at  Lord's. He also took a leading part in Test match cricket between 1899 and 1909, appearing for England in sixteen games in this country and going out to Australia with A. C. MacLaren's team in 1901-02 and with the M.C.C.'s side two years later. In England he made three hundreds against  Australia, scoring 138 at Birmingham in 1902 (after the side had started in disastrous fashion), 100 at Leeds in  1905, and 112 not out at The Oval in the latter year. In all he scored 1,661 runs in Test Matches with an average of 30. Tyldesley was a member of the team Lord Hawke took out to South Africa in the winter of 1898-99. He scored 742 runs during the tour with an average of 32. Among his innings was one of 112 in a Test match at Cape Town. There were few batsmen more attractive to watch than John Tyldesley. He was exceptionally quick on his feet and so always appeared to have plenty of time in which to make his strokes. Essentially a batsman of enterprise, when he went forward to the ball it was nearly always to hit. He also possessed a very strong defence and had at his command practically all the strokes in the game. His ability to adapt himself to circumstances was emphasised in a Test match at The Oval in 1905, when Armstrong, bowling well outside the leg-stump with an offbreak, reduced to impotence a number of batsmen, but not Tyldesley, who drew back and cut him.

Though never one of the giants of the game and rarely aspiring to brilliance of style, he established himself - especially\nduring the 1920s-as one of the pillars of Lancashire cricket, so that his final total of runs and centuries in first-class cricket has remained unsurpassed by any Lancashire player. \n', 'He was born at Roe Green, Lancashire, on February 5, 1889, and as a boy benefited from the guidance and tuition of his elder brother, the great J. T. Tyldesley. Although he eventually scored more runs than his brother-indeed, at a better average, too - Ernest suffered somewhat by comparison with ""J.T."", who\nhad, of course, already performed heroically in the ""Golden Age"" before Ernest gained a regular place in county cricket. He made his debut for Lancashire\nin 1909 and progressed but modestly until the First World War, but on the resumption of cricket in 1919 he advanced to the head of the Lancashire averages\nand began to show that consistent reliability that was to characterise his many seasons in the game. Not always happy at the commencement of an innings, his\npatience and the soundness of his defence often brought their reward in big scores. Seven times he made a double-century for Lancashire and twice scored a\nhundred in each innings of a match. On six occasions - the last time in his forty-sixth year - he passed 2,000 runs in the season, and in 1928 he amassed 3,024 runs at an average of 79.57: that summer he hit ten centuries, which he had also done in 1926, no Lancastrian either before or since having twice achieved that target.', ""He played in fourteen Tests for England, in this country and in Australia and South Africa, hitting centuries at Johannesburg, Durban and Lord's: in fact,\nit was not often that he failed in Tests, scoring in all 990 runs at an average of 55. He twice toured South Africa, in 1924-25 and in 1927-28, both visits proving highly successful for him, the matting wickets emphasising what a highly resourceful and accomplished batsman he was. Following his great summer in 1928,\nhe toured Australia with A. P. F. Chapman's talented side, but was chosen for only one Test. He also toured Jamaica with great success under the Hon. L. H.\nTennyson in the spring of 1927."", 'Of the many batting feats that stand to his name, the most remarkable was his seven centuries in seven successive matches (four of them in consecutive innings) in 1926, when Lancashire regained the championship after twenty-two years. In 1928, when Lancashire were champions for the third successive year, he shared with F. Watson a partnership of 371 for the second wicket against Surrey at Old Trafford, which remains the highest stand ever made in first-class cricket on that ground and the record stand for any Lancashire wicket.\nWhen he retired in 1936 he had scored 38,874 runs at 45.46 and hit 102 centuries, the highest being 256 not out against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in 1930. He later served as a member of the Lancashire committee, and in 1949 was made a life member of the M.C.C.

Since then many have gone past his overall figure of 307, but few have matched his average (21.57) and strike rate (a wicket every 49 balls). Trueman\'s tally might have been nearer 400 if he hadn\'t missed numerous matches and tours because of various disciplinary breaches, some true, some imagined - he was once hauled before the Yorkshire committee for some misdemeanour, and escaped punishment by pointing out that he was 200 miles away playing for England at the time. But on his day Trueman was fast and frightening: in his first Test series, in 1952, he helped reduce India to 0 for 4 on his debut, and took 8 for 31 - the best Test bowling figures by a genuinely fast bowler at the time - in the third match. In the second half of the \'50s he formed an incisive new-ball pairing with Brian Statham, the legendarily accurate loose-limbed Lancastrian, who raced him neck-and-neck to the 250-wicket mark.

On his second XI debut for Warwickshire in 2002, effectively a trial game, Jonathan Trott scored a dominant 245 that suggested the arrival of a special talent. It was, after all, the highest score by a debutant in the history of Second XI Championship cricket and convinced Warwickshire to sign Trott, unlike Kevin Pietersen in a similar situation three years earlier. But not Trott. He smashed his bat in frustration after his dismissal. This was a man whose hunger for runs would not be easily sated. \n', ""Starting well was a theme of Trott's career. In 2003 he made a century on first-class debut as an opener for Warwickshire against a strong Sussex attack - he was 96 not out at lunch - and in 2009 he made a century on Test debut at The Oval. To have played such a significant part in England winning an Ashes decider earned his reputation as a technically correct, temperamentally sound top-order batsman. Though less glorious tours of South Africa and Bangladesh followed, Trott sealed his reputation with a double-century against Bangladesh at Lord's and a masterful 184 against a Pakistan side at the same ground. Though the match was later tarnished by spot-fixing revelations, Trott later said he considered the innings his best as he defied Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif and helped rescue England from 102 for 7."", ""Trott went on to play a key part in England retaining the Ashes in Australia in 2010-11 - the first time they had won a Test series there in nearly a quarter of a century - with centuries at Adelaide and Melbourne and the defeat of India in England the following summer to assume the No.1 Test ranking. His standing as the finest No. 3 England had possessed for many years was confirmed. Despite a relatively lean 2012, during which he averaged 38.65, Trott's remarkable consistency was demonstrated by a run at the start of the following year, when his lowest score in 17 consecutive Test and ODI innings was 27, with two hundreds and six half-centuries."", 'Born in Cape Town to a British father and South African mother, Trott played for the South Africa side from Under-15 to Under-19 level, graduating into the Boland and then the Western Province teams. His future in the South Africa side looked assured. But Trott, never easily satisfied, wanted more. Bored by further education - he admits he had to look at the blackboard to even spell the subject during the psychology portion of his exam in the Human Movement Science degree he abandoned at Stellenbosch University - he took advantage of his British passport and his relationship with Bob Woolmer, who coached South Africa and Warwickshire, to arrange a trail in England. He soon embraced the club and country with a passion, marrying the granddaughter of former club captain HE ""Tom"" Dollery and insisting he felt ""completely British"" and that he preferred Birmingham to Cape Town.', ""There have been some downs amid the ups. In 2007, in the middle of Mark Greatbatch's unhappy period as director of cricket at Edgbaston, Trott endured a chronic loss of form that saw him average only 22 and Warwickshire suffer relegation in both first-class and List A formats. Oddly, he made his international debut that season having been called into the England T20I team. After breaking his hand in the nets prior to the match, it was one of the few times he made an underwhelming debut. "", ""Despite setting a record in 2009 for the most runs in an English domestic T20 season of 10 matches, some have never accepted his value as a limited-overs player, either. While Trott's ODI average in excess of 50 is substantially higher than any regular England player in ODI history, his strike-rate of around 75 was a source of constant discussion - never more so than during the 2013 Champions Trophy, when the make-up of England's top three was questioned. The records showed, however, that when Trott flourishes, England flourished too, and he was their leading run-scorer as they narrowly failed to win the competition."", 'His presence at the crease had arguably become the most reassuring sight in English cricket since the retirement of Graham Gooch. His prolonged marking of his guard was as near as cricket got to a national talking point. But when he abruptly left England\'s 2012-13 Ashes tour after the first Test in Brisbane with a stress-related illness, England\'s director of cricket, Andy Flower, bemoaned the loss of his ""rock"".', 'An early attempt at a comeback at the start of the 2014 season had to be aborted after it transpired there would be no quick fix to his problems and a discomfort against the short ball became more apparent. But, after a break, he returned strongly towards the end of the season, ending the Royal London One-Day campaign as the highest England-qualified run-scorer and helping Warwickshire to second place in the Championship. It was enough to win him a recall to the Lions squad for the tour of South Africa and, following a double-century there, a Test recall in the Caribbean.', 'Asked to open the batting, he reached double-figures only once in six innings and suffered three ducks as it became apparent that he was still troubled by anxiety problems. It was no surprise when he announced his retirement from international cricket at the end of the tour. He played on for Warwickshire until 2018, a consummate team man. His final summer was relaxed and productive, helped by his early announcement of his intention to retire. As it wound down, there was even a double century stand with Ian Bell against Kent to encourage nostalgia.

6 ft 3 in ",,Opening batsman,Left-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"['\nA brutal left-handed opening batsman, Marcus Trescothick was one of the finest opening batsmen to play for England and also stood in as captain for two Tests and 10 ODIs.  He was an automatic choice from the turn of the century until a stress-related illness intervened with him not much past his 30th birthday and forced his international retirement in 2008. The anxiety attacks he suffered, particularly when having to contend with long periods away from home and family, brought the issue of depression and stress in sport into sharp focus in the English game and there was general delight when he continued his county career at Somerset where his genial biffing of county attacks brought much entertainment at Taunton and elsewhere. Somerset sought his services beyond his 40th birthday, confirming him as one of the great stalwarts of the English game in any era. \n', ""Capacious of build and comfortable of movement, he had a benign air at the crease which meant that when he bullied attacks, which he did often, he bullied them gently. Not particularly mobile in the field, he turned himself into a safe slip fielder. He was a key factor in England's change in fortunes and, most notably, spearheaded an aggressive approach against Australia in the Ashes win of 2005. "", ""There was something biblical about Trescothick's early career: seven years of plenty as a schoolboy, seven years of famine when he reached the Somerset 1st XI. And lo, it came to pass in 1999 that he batted on a pacey pitch at Taunton against Glamorgan while Duncan Fletcher was their coach, and made a storming 167, with five sixes, when the next-best score was 50. When England needed a stand-in one-day opener in 2000, Fletcher, by then elevated to the England job, remembered Trescothick. He took to international cricket immediately. A true opener, he formed a habit of starting a series well with a mixture of expert leaves, crisp cover-drives, spanking pulls and fearless slog-sweeps."", ""Hefty, genial, and at ease on the big stage, Trescothick's first four England hundreds came in a losing cause, confirming his ability to keep his head while all around were losing theirs. Opening in Tests with Mike Atherton, Trescothick acquired the air of a senior player as if by osmosis - he joined the management committee on his first tour. All that stood between him and the highest level was a tendency to get out when well set, to make a breezy 20 or 30. He seemed to have conquered this with a domineering home season in 2002, but it reappeared - like so many English frailties - as soon as the team landed in Australia. Trescothick endured fluctuating fortunes over the next couple of seasons. He showed glimpses of his blazing best against South Africa in 2003, when he capped his season with a determined 219 (and 69 not out) in the astonishing series-levelling victory at The Oval, but his form slid away drastically in the Caribbean that winter."", ""The selectors never lost faith with him and, having stood in as captain for the first Test of the 2004 season, Trescothick cracked a pair of hundreds against West Indies at Edgbaston. At Johannesburg in 2004-05, he set up England's series victory with a brutal 180 on the final morning, and carried his domineering form into the home season. Having bullied 345 runs in two innings against the Bangladeshis, he made 431 runs against Australia in a memorable summer of 2005, as he - and England - finally got the better of the one nation that really mattered. He cracked 90 in the second Test at Edgbaston, underlining that this England side was not lying down. It ignited the summer, a hope-laden innings from a player who was widely praised as the most selfless of cricketers."", 'But his winter was cut short when he returned home suddenly from India under a cloak of secrecy, and after an indifferent summer it was announced he would miss the Champions Trophy as he was still recovering from a stress-related illness. He was included in the Ashes squad for the 2006-07 campaign Down Under but lasted less than two weeks before he was again boarding a flight back home with a recurrence of his illness.', ""His return to action started with Somerset and his 2007 form, plus England's continued failings in one-day cricket, meant he was recalled to England's preliminary 30-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup. But he never made the cut, and, in March 2008, days after withdrawing at the last minute from Somerset's pre-season tour to the UAE - he was in an outlet of Dixons, the electrical store, when he decided he could not board the plane - he announced his retirement from international cricket. His candid autobiography, "", "", was published in 2008, and told of his battle with the 'black wings' of depression."", ""The book had a cathartic effect. In 2009 he enjoyed one of his most prolific seasons yet, scoring nearly 3,000 runs for Somerset in all competitions. He was named captain following Justin Langer's decision not to return for 2010 and even overcame his reservations to take part in the county's Champions League campaign in India that October, although he flew home after the group stages."", ""Already enshrined in Somerset folklore, with a stand named in his honour, he nearly delivered the ultimate prize in 2010. His 1,397 runs at 58.20 helped Somerset enter the final day of the season knowing victory at Durham would be enough to win them their maiden County Championship. But time ran out on Somerset and Nottinghamshire achieved the bonus point they needed with three wickets after tea to snatch the title. Seemingly getting better with age, Trescothick plundered 1,673 runs in 2011 at a career-best season's average of 79.66. He also led Somerset to the finals of both the Friends Life t20 and Cyldesdale Bank 40, only to lose both. A year later, injury and poor weather resulted in a less-than-prolific season but, undeterred by his advancing years, Trescothick signed a new three year deal with Somerset in November 2012 but failed to score a century in any competition in 2013 - the first time in his career he has gone through a season without a three figure score. He recovered, in the first-class game at least, rattling up a formidable 1284 runs at 45.86 to help offset Somerset's relegation fears in 2015, including 210 not out in a vital late-season draw against Sussex at Hove."", ""He must have felt as he passed his 40th birthday on Christmas Day that his chances of leading Somerset to that elusive Championship title had diminished. But he could not have imagined the agonising miss that befell Somerset in 2016 when they wrapped up a win in their final game at Taunton with a day to spare, went top of the table, but watched Middlesex and Yorkshire - both with title aspirations of their own - manufacture a positive result at Lord's. Trescothick had a wonderful personal season to look back on: 1,239 Championship runs and four more hundreds, capped by 218 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, an innings made on a stonkingly hot day which took him alongside Harold Gimblett as Somerset's most prolific century-maker in first-class cricket. He entered 2017 amid hopes in the West Country that the record would come his way at Taunton with the Quantocks shimmering in the haze and the chance to raise a glass to it with a post-match cider in the Ring of Bells. It duly arrived in May, bringing delight to an otherwise drab rain-affected draw against Warwickshire."", 'By now, uncertainty over whether Trescothick would play on had become an annual ritual. In 2018, he broke his foot while turning awkwardly when batting against Lancashire at Old Trafford (on 95, he hobbled to a century), but retained the desire to recover before the end of the season andagree another year at his beloved Taunton.', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1996,1997', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005']",76.0,143,10,5825.0,219,43.79,10685,54.51,14,29,831,42,95.0,0.0,123.0,122,6,4335.0,137,37.37,5087,85.21,12,21,528,41,49.0,0.0,3.0,3,0,166.0,72,55.33,131,126.71,0,2,23,1,2.0,0.0,385.0,665,36,26089,284,41.47,,,66,127,,,550.0,0.0,372.0,357,29,12229,184,37.28,,,28,63,,,149.0,0.0,89.0,87,5,2363,108*,28.81,1569,150.60,2,17,304,80,29.0,0.0,76.0,10,300,155,1.0,1/34,1/34,155.0,3.10,300.0,0,0,0,123.0,13,232,219,4.0,2/7,2/7,54.75,5.66,58.0,0,0,0,3.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,385.0,,2704,1551,36,4/36,,43.08,3.44,75.1,,0,0,372.0,,2010,1644,57,4/50,4/50,28.84,4.90,35.2,1,0,0,89.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

Instead, England will be primarily grateful for memories of the 2010-11 Ashes series when he was a key part of their series victory in Australia. \n', 'It was apt that Tremlett announced his retirement in 2015 after conceding that his body could not stand the rigours of professional cricket any longer. He cut a gentle, passive figure for a fast bowler, which made him an easy target as the injuries mounted and his impact could never be relied upon, with some suspecting that he wilted under pressure, but a lesser figurer would also have abandoned hope much earlier. ', ""Tremlett played 12 Tests, 15 ODIs and one T20 for England. He made his Test debut against India, at Lord's, in 2007 and bowled impressively in his first series but the twin devils of injury and inconsistency ensured he did not play another Test until the tour of Australia in 2010-11."", 'His recall in Perth marked the beginning of his most successful spell as an international bowler as he collected 17 wickets in three matches to help England win down under for the first time in 24 years. He took 17 wickets at 23.35, which included the Ashes-winning wicket and fleetingly became part of a strong pack of fast bowlers that led England to the top of the world rankings, following his Ashes success with 15 wickets in three Tests against Sri Lanka. That series led to comparisons with Joel Garner but, having broken into the top ten rankings, injury struck. ', ""Although he played a Test in UAE against Pakistan the following winter he was not fully fit and had surgery to remedy his back problems soon after. Many believed that would be the end of his international career but he returned to play three more Tests over the subsequent three years - one apiece against India, Sri Lanka and his final appearance against Australia, at Brisbane, in late 2013. The latter was the first Test of England's unhappy Ashes tour in 2013-14, when he passed 50 Test wickets more than six years after his debut. He was a bad, theoretical pick - England's desire for a physically threatening pace attack, and respect for his Ashes record on the previous tour of Australia, flying in the face of his mediocre county form for Surrey. England, oddly, were reported to be shocked by his pace which rarely touched 80mph - 10mph or so down on his previous trip to Australia."", 'His ODI debut had come two years before his Test bow and he claimed four wickets in his first appearance against Bangladesh in 2005. However, another 14 matches spread over seven years brought just 11 further scalps.', 'Across a 146-match first-class career for Hampshire and Surrey, he claimed 459 wickets at 28.66 with a career-best of 8 for 96. He also took 180 List A wickets and 75 in T20.', ""Tremlett came from an esteemed cricketing family: son of Tim Tremlett, the former Hampshire seamer, and the grandson of Maurice, who played for Somerset and England in the 1940s and 50s. He took a wicket with his first ball of first-class cricket, against New Zealand A in 2000 and after impressing for Hampshire made the England Under-19 tour of India in 2000-01, and a place in the first batch of Rod Marsh's academy intakes in 2001-02."", ""An impressive start to the 2004 season with Hampshire earned him a call up to England's preliminary squad for the ICC Champions Trophy, and the following year he was named in England's new 25-man development squad, ahead of the 2005 Ashes. He made his one-day debut during the 2005 NatWest Series - and was denied a hat-trick against Bangladesh only because the ball bounced off middle stump without dislodging the bails. Despite his domestic performances tailing off in the second half of the 2005 season and a suspicion that he tended to lose rhythm under pressure, Tremlett earned a call-up to the England squad for Pakistan before a hamstring injury ruled him out. It set the precedent for his international career. "", ""After much injury disruption, he was handed his Test debut against India at Lord's. Troubling the much-vaunted Indian batting line-up with uncomfortable bounce and lively pace, he looked set to be a key man as England looked to forge a new attack after the 2005 generation. Instead injury struck once more."", ""After missing the 2007-08 winter tours he was included in England's ODI squad to face Scotland but a heel injury ended his hopes. After a frustrating 2009 season, where he played seven Championship matches, he left Hampshire for Surrey. It was a move that worked wonders - Surrey's large squad meant he did not have to play every game - and, after taking 48 Championship wickets, he earned a recall for the Ashes tour that established his reputation as a high-class quick."", 'There were still a few moments to remind everybody of his talent: five wickets in seven overs to inspire a turnaround victory against Gloucestershire in May 2014. His batting was also much improved as he came within ten runs of a maiden first-class hundred against Leicestershire, playing with a maturity and calmness his batting had previously lacked. His last first-class appearance came for Surrey against Glamorgan at Guildford in 2015 after which he took specialist advice to call time on his career. He was 34, a good age, but it was hard to escape the conclusion, however, that his retirement was clouded with thoughts of what might have been.', '\n', ' ']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2000', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2001']",12.0,15,4,113.0,25*,10.27,299,37.79,0,0,12,0,4.0,0.0,15.0,11,4,50.0,19*,7.14,89,56.17,0,0,2,2,4.0,0.0,1.0,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,86.9,-,-,-,-,0.0,0.0,146.0,183,45,2462,90,17.84,,,0,10,,,38.0,0.0,133.0,83,27,563,38*,10.05,,,0,0,,,27.0,0.0,59.0,22,11,100,13,9.09,95,105.26,0,0,4,3,5.0,0.0,12.0,23,2902,1431,53.0,6/48,8/150,27.0,2.95,54.7,2,2,0,15.0,15,784,705,15.0,4/32,4/32,47.0,5.39,52.2,1,0,0,1.0,1,24,45,2.0,2/45,2/45,22.50,11.25,12.0,0,0,0,146.0,,25154,13158,459,8/96,,28.66,3.13,54.8,,13,0,133.0,,6129,5002,180,4/25,4/25,27.78,4.89,34.0,6,0,0,59.0,59,1187,1452,75,4/16,4/16,19.36,7.33,15.8,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

He had\nbegun as a brilliant counter-attacking left-hander who came off the ropes\nfrom the start of his innings to punch a quick 20 and seize the initiative,\nan invaluable trait. But being the first England player to undergo ten\nconsecutive years of touring, for the A and Test team, troubled his back,\ndulled his edge and gave him a reputation for grumpiness. In 1999-2000, he\nopted out of the tour to South Africa, a decision which seemed to be the\nfinal step before fulfilment. The winter's rest, and time for reflection\nwith his family, brought him to a mature peak - as a batsman who enjoyed his\ncricket again, the best allround fielder in the team, a contributor in the\ndressing-room and occasional captain. But in 2002 his career reached crisis\npoint as his marriage crumbled in full view of the tabloids. With England's\nbusiest-ever winter looming, he announced his retirement from the one-day\ngame, took an indefinite break from all forms of cricket, returned and\nannounced his readiness to tour Australia - and then pulled out again in a\nmove which seemed to signal the end of his Test career. However, in another turnaround at the start of the 2003 English season, Thorpe again insisted he was ready to return to England colours, in both forms of the game, but was surprisingly overlooked for the first Test against South Africa. He did return, though, for the crucial final Test at The Oval, where he delighted everyone with a century that helped set up England's astonishing comeback. Since that innings, Thorpe went on to score 1635 runs at 56.37 in England's successful run, also reaching the milestone of 100 Tests, against Bangladesh at the start of the 2005 season.  He was omitted from the squad to face Australia at Lord's on July 21, and one day into the match he announced his retirement, a decision that brought a premature end to the career of one of England's toughest competitors."", '\n', ' \n']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1998', 'Awarded the MBE in 2006']",100.0,179,28,6744.0,200*,44.66,14693,45.89,16,39,778,9,105.0,0.0,82.0,77,13,2380.0,89,37.18,3344,71.17,0,21,172,5,42.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,341.0,567,80,21937,223*,45.04,,,49,122,,,290.0,0.0,354.0,332,58,10871,145*,39.67,,,9,80,,,168.0,0.0,5.0,4,0,95,50,23.75,68,139.70,0,1,11,2,1.0,0.0,100.0,6,138,37,0.0,-,-,35.33,1.60,-,0,0,0,82.0,5,120,97,2.0,2/15,2/15,48.5,4.85,60.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,341.0,,2387,1378,26,4/40,,53.00,3.46,91.8,,0,0,354.0,,721,649,16,3/21,3/21,40.56,5.40,45.0,0,0,0,5.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

Only three weeks earlier he had umpired the opening match of the Australians' tour against the Duke of Norfolk's XI at Arundel. \n"", ""Maurice Tate was the son of Fred Tate, the Sussex and England cricketer whose name will ever be associated with the 1902 Test at Old Trafford, which England lost by three runs. Fred Tate missed a vital catch and was last out when England wanted only four runs to win. In his reminiscences, published in 1934, Maurice Tate wrote that his father's greatest ambition was to see his son playing for England and retrieving his own tragic blunder. How well the son atoned for the father's misfortune! Maurice Tate began as a slow off-break bowler and had been playing some years before he developed his fast-medium action which gave him a deceptive swerve and tremendous pace off the pitch. He was probably the first bowler deliberately to use the seam and many of the best batsmen of the day regarded him as the most dangerous bowler they had ever played against."", ""He will be remembered as one of the greatest-hearted bowlers in the game -- and one of cricket's most lovable and colourful personalities. He was an inveterate fun-maker and wherever he went he found new friends. He could go on bowling for hours, keeping an immaculate length and seeming to enjoy every moment of the game. A large and amiable man, with many of the characteristics of the true rustic, his broad grin and large feet were a gift to contemporary cartoonists."", 'Between 1912 and 1937, when he retired from the game, Tate took 2,784 wickets at an average cost of 18.12 runs. A. E. R. Gilligan, his old county and England captain, told of his conversion when, reviewing the history of Sussex cricket in the 1954 ', ', he wrote:', '""Tate, I must say at once, was the greatest bowler our county has produced. Curiously, when I first played for Sussex, Maurice used the same run-up and style of delivery as his father -- a slow bowler! A sheer piece of luck caused Maurice to change his methods. Sussex had batted very badly in 1922, and when we had a day off the whole team practised at the nets. Maurice Tate bowled me several of his slow deliveries, then down came a quick one which spreadeagled my stumps. He did this three times. I went up to him and said: `Maurice, you must change your style of bowling immediately.\' My hunch paid. In the next match against Kent at Tunbridge Wells, Maurice, in his new style as a quick bowler, was unplayable. He took three wickets in four balls and eight in the innings for 67. That was the turning-point in his career.""', ""In the Test Trial at Lord's in 1923, he took five wickets without a run being scored from him after The Rest had made 200 for four wickets. They were out for 205. The following year Maurice and I bowled out South Africa at Birmingham for 30 -- a day neither of us will ever forget. I was fortunate to take six for seven runs, and Maurice captured the other four for 12. In the second innings we shared nine wickets and England won by an innings. The tide flowed for Sussex bowlers about that time, for we had previously dismissed Surrey for 53 at The Oval, and in the Whitsuntide match at Lord's had disposed of Middlesex in their second innings for 41."", ""Maurice was a member of my 1924-25 M.C.C. team to Australia and on this tour he beat Arthur Mailey's record of 36 wickets in a Test series by taking 38. He bowled  Mailey out to gain his 37th success! Besides being a great bowler, Maurice was a hard-hitting batsman with a wealth of strokes. He scored 17,518 runs (average 24.19) for the county and took 2,223 wickets (average 16.34). For seven consecutive seasons he did the double and in 1929 he took over 100 wickets for the county alone and scored more than 1,000 runs in first-class cricket. In fact, with the exception of 1933 when a damaged foot kept him out of the last three matches (he had taken 99 wickets), he never failed to take over 100 wickets for Sussex."", ""In 1953 Alec Bedser beat Tate's Test record by taking 39 wickets in a series, and many times since I have been asked how I compare Bedser with Maurice. My answer is: `They are two very great bowlers.' Having said that, I still think that  Maurice Tate just stands out as the superior bowler of the two, bearing in mind the strength of the Australian batting in the 1924-25 series. But it is a very close thing indeed and one must not forget that Bedser had to contend with Bradman between 1946 and 1948."", ' Tate played in 20 consecutive Test matches against Australia and represented  England in a further 19 Tests against South Africa, India and the West Indies. In all he took 155 Test wickets -- a feat excelled only by A. V. Bedser and S. F. Barnes.', ""Tate was so consistently successful as a bowler that the quality of his batting is now often overlooked. Yet he was one of the best all-rounders of his generation. He scored 100 not out against South Africa in the Lord's Test in 1929. Eight times he completed the cricketers' double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season -- and in 1923, 1924 and 1925 his bag of wickets topped 200. Fourteen times he took over 100 wickets in a season."", 'As a batsman, his best season was 1927, when he scored 1,713 runs, including five centuries. In 1922 he was the best all-rounder in the country, taking 118 wickets and scoring only 22 short of his 1,000. In 1921 he shared with Bowley a second wicket partnership of 385 against Northants -- a Sussex record.', 'Tate was the first professional ever to captain Sussex -- the honour later fell to James Langridge -- and after his retirement he was elected an honorary life member of the County Club. He was also one of the former professionals similarly honoured by M.C.C. in 1949.', 'When he retired from first-class cricket, Tate took over the licences of several Sussex inns and for a number of years coached the boys of Tonbridge School.', 'Tributes included the following:', ': Tate was a very great cricketer indeed. He could make the ball swing away very late outside the off-stump, and even the best batsmen were often beaten by him. He could make the ball rear off the pitch like a snake striking. He was even more successful in Australia than in this country -- in fact, he ranks with S. F. Barnes as the most successful bowler England has ever sent there.', '  ', ': Maurice was one of the greatest bowlers of all time. It is difficult to find words to praise him sufficiently. I know from experience how difficult it was to lay against him.', 'A. E. R. Gilligan: His death has come as a great shock to everybody in Sussex, and in fact the whole of the cricket world. Not only was Maurice a great bowler; he was a very great sportsman. He played cricket for the real joy and fun of it. It was his life.', ': I doubt whether we shall ever see the like of Maurice again. He was a great bowler and a great character. How they loved him in Australia! As a bowler he made the batsman play at five balls out of six. He was the finest fast-medium bowler I ever played with or against.', "": He was the best bowler of his type I have ever kept wicket to. If the modern field-placing had been in vogue when he was playing, I feel sure he would have taken hundreds more wickets. Often batsmen would get an inside edge which now would almost certainly mean a catch at short-leg. In Maurice's day, the ball used to run harmlessly down the leg-side."", ': He was the best length bowler I ever kept wicket to and the best bowler of his pace I ever knew. There was not a quicker bowler off the wicket. I class him with Sidney Barnes and F. R.

He never courted popularity, but revered loyalty. And in the end he became famous all over again for being very old. \n', ""When Bob Wyatt died on April 20, he was 93, England's senior Test player. The mantle passes to little Derbyshire legspinner Tommy Mitchell (born Sept 4, 1902), which in itself is a somewhat amusing irony, for Wyatt's handling of him in the Ashes series of 1934 prompted Mitchell to explode, `You couldn't captain a box of lead soldiers!'"", "" Wyatt was never going to be as `popular' with his players as a Percy Chapman, whom he succeeded as England captain for the final Test against Australia at The Oval in 1930. His substitution for the flamboyant Kent left-hander set him up as the unwitting target of some caustic Press reaction and poison-pen letters, even death threats. He went in at No. 7 to face the wily Grimmett, his side 197 for 5, and made a doughty 64 in England's eventual 405. But Bradman then scored 232, Ponsford 110, and Australia made 695 and went on to win by an innings."", ""It was the first of 16 Tests in which Wyatt led his country. Three were won, eight drawn, and five lost, but two of the successes were conspicuous: the innings victory over Australia in 1934, in which Hedley Verity's 15 for 104 on a damp pitch was instrumental, remains the only win at Lord's this century against the Oldest Enemy, while the bizarre victory over West Indies at Bridgetown in conditions almost impossible for batting was to be the last inflicted there on the home side for 59 years."", ' Robert Elliott Storey Wyatt was born in Milford, Surrey on may 2, 1901 and educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry. An amateur cricketer throughout, he gained employment variously in insurance, engineering and with Warwickshire CCC, a club for which he made his debut in 1923. Working his way up the batting order, and bowling medium-pace, he was to make almost 22,000 runs for Warwickshire (51 centuries) and take over 650 wickets by the time of his last match for the county, in 1939. He had succeeded Freddie Calthorpe as captain in 1930 and weathered a conspiracy or two before being ousted after the 1937 season, Peter Cranmer being installed. A man of firm ideas, Wyatt had become embroiled in personal conflicts in dressing-room as well as committee-room.', 'It so happened that in 1937, his last in charge at Edgbaston, he recorded his two double-centuries, both at that ground: 232 against Derbyshire, when he had a stand of 253 with Tom Dollery, and 201 not out, which also took about seven hours, against Lancashire, the Wyatt/ Dollery partnership this time stretching to 319. Both innings came in the month of July, his career of 40 Tests having closed at Melbourne earlier that year.', ""After the Second World War, during which he served in the RAF, he played for Worcestershire and became joint-captain in 1949 and captain in 1950 and'51 (when he turned 50). The county finished third, sixth and fourth in those seasons and gained in self-esteem. Wyatt by now was a Test selector, and chairman in 1950, when he was blamed for disciplinary action against Bill Edrich after the Middlesex batsman had celebrated noisily during the night in anticipation of victory over West Indies at Old Trafford. His room was next to Wyatt's. Varying viewpoints were aired in Gerald Pawle's 1985 biography ("", ""), one being that Freddie Brown would certainly have taken Edrich to Australia that winter if he had wanted him. The taint, nonetheless, stuck to Wyatt or Edrich, dependent upon one's personal disposition."", "" Bob Wyatt's strength of character was never in question, and nor was his bravery. Time and again he sustained serious injury and was back before the doctors wanted or expected. He played against Australia in 1934 with a metal shield on his broken right thumb, and missed the first half of the 1936-37 tour of Australia after his forearm was fractured. Most renowned of his accidents, however, was the broken jaw at Sabina Park, Jamaica in March 1935."", ""A month earlier, having endured a severe blow over the heart of Ken Farnes during net practice and then gone down with influenza, Wyatt was given a tiny model of a coffin by a local `fan'. In it was an exquisitely-carved corpse with a photo of Wyatt pasted on the head. `This is what Martindale do to you!' said the `cricket-lover'. It was eerily prophetic."", ""Martindale's bouncer broke Wyatt's jaw in four places, the impact noisy, the result messy. But as soon as he regained consciousness on a stretcher in the dressing-room, Wyatt signalled for a pencil and wrote out an amended batting order. From hospital he sent a note to the West Indian bowler clearing him of all blame."", 'Was his nerve affected? Hardly: six weeks later he scored a century against Surrey (rampant Alf Gover and all) in his first match back - though he had to survive first a colliding lorry in Earls Court - and made another against Gloucestershire. He was ready to continue captaining England against South Africa.', ""As a batsman he was inevitably classified as `dour', and was unquestionably an `academic', constantly thinking cricket, exploring and discussing theory. But when responsibility slackened, such as in the festival matches at Scarborough, he could be a joy to watch. Even at 50 the strength was there, as when a six was needed off the final ball of a Championship match at Taunton, and Wyatt duly drove Bertie Buse high into the pavilion."", ""`There's a nonsensical doctrine today,' he once said, `that you're only attacking if you're on the front foot. But look at the runs Bradman and Hammond scored off the back foot. You can't pretend they weren't attacking batsmen.' And for 60 years he deplored the amendment to the lbw law that allowed batsmen to be given out to balls pitching outside off stump. This diminished back-foot play as batsmen became wary of the much-increased deployment of offspin and inswing bowling. Wyatt always insisted that a widening of the wicket would have been sufficient to restore balance between bat and ball, and he also believed in leaving the pitch uncovered. Nor did he ever pretend to be tolerant of limited-overs cricket, with all its artificiality."", ""He toured the world: India, Burma and Ceylon with MCC in 1926-27 (claiming a hat-trick and a century in one match in Ceylon); South Africa (twice), where his first Test innings, on matting at the old Wanderers ground, Johannesburg, lasted one ball; West Indies (twice), where his first tour, 1929-30, was marked by a partnership of 148 with Andy Sandham which helped the Surrey batsman on his way, at Sabina Park, to the first triple-century in Test history; Australia and New Zealand (twice); South America, with Sir Theodore Brinckman's team in 1937-38; Egypt (twice) with Martineau's team: and he would have gone to India again in 1939-40 had the outbreak of war not rendered the tour impossible."", ""His mark in Test cricket will probably be most prominent in respect of England's 1932-33 tour of Australia, when he was vice-captain to Douglas Jardine. The bouncer attack on the line of the body (`Bodyline') of the Australian batsmen by Harold Larwood and Bill Voce caused lasting bitterness between the two nations and many of the central figures, but Wyatt saw his skipper as a `kind' man of `tremendous charm', conceding only that after having taken such a dislike to Australians on the previous tour ( 1928-29), it might have been unwise for Jardine to have returned."", ""In fact, Wyatt was the first to set the concentrated leg-side field. With Jardine on fishing holiday in Tasmania, he led MCC against An Australian XI at the MCG, and set what he saw purely as a ` leg-theory' field for Larwood once the ball had lost its shine. The rest is history, with no scarcity of documentation."", ""One morsel of amusement, though, did reveal Wyatt's sense of mischief and humour. After Bradman played on to Bowes first ball at Melbourne in the Second Test, Wyatt reacted to the Australian barrackers quite differently to Jardine. As wickets continued to fall, he turned to them at intervals and asked, in that clipped tone of his, `When's your Don coming in then?'"", ""Over 60 years later, in his tribute to Bob Wyatt, Sir Donald could not be faulted in his verdict: that he was `a very good batsman, pedestrian rather than exciting; he lived by the rulebook.'"", ""In his 40 Tests, Wyatt scored 1839 runs at 31.71, his two centuries coming against South Africa, 113 at Old Trafford in 1929 in his maiden home Test, when he and Frank Woolley put on 245 in 165 minutes, and 149 at Trent Bridge in 1935, a drawn match preceding the historic Lord's Test when Wyatt led England to their first defeat by South Africa on English soil."", 'He took 18 Test wickets at 35.67 and held 16 catches.', 'In all first-class cricket he ranks No. 19 with 39,405 runs from his 1141 innings, his average a highly respectable 40.05. Of his 85 centuries, 11 tellingly came off the taxing Yorkshire bowling. Seventeen times, and once abroad, he reached 1000 runs in a season, five times passing 2000, with 2630 (53.67) in 1929 as his most prolific summer. His stand of 228 with Arthur Croom at Dudley in 1925 remains a Warwickshire eighth-wicket record.', ""His medium-pace and offspin brought him 901 wickets at 32.85, his best figures coming at Lord's, 7 for 43 against Middlesex, in 1926, the year he came closest to the double (1485 runs/92 wickets). He held 415 catches and once made a stumping."", "" Wyatt played in 23 matches for the Gentlemen against the Players between 1926 and 1947, and in 1934 he struck 104 not out at Lord's, once hitting Verity for six, as his Gentlemen XI raced to victory, launched by an opening stand of 160 in 90 minutes by Wyatt and the stylish Cyril Walters."", ' Bob Wyatt was a ', ' Cricketer of the Year in 1930, and author of ', ' and ', ', the former one of the outstanding cricket textbooks, published in 1936, the latter an autobiography, released in 1951. His final first-class match was for Free Foresters in 1957.', 'He never lost touch with the game. In 1989, the year his 1929-30 MCC tour blazer was discovered on a rubbish tip and returned to him, he defied the pain and inconvenience of hip disability to journey to South Africa for the Test centenary celebrations.', ""The Lord's Taverners made certain that his 90th birthday did not go unmarked by hosting a lunch at the Berkeley, where Bob Wyatt enthralled the gathering with clear recollection of cricketers and matches, remarking along the way that `all the speakers today have flattered me, but at my age it's unlikely to do me much harm'. In March 1991, as Gooch's England side came back from an unsuccessful Australian campaign as the Gulf War was ending, Wyatt wrote to the "", "": `After hearing that Saddam Hussein is claiming victory, can I suggest that they run up the flag at Lord's and say we won the Ashes'."", ""All kinds of physical handicaps rendered his last years uncomfortable, but determinedly he travelled from Cornwall, with his sweet wife Mollie, whom he married in 1942. Only last year he was at Lord's no more than a week after suffering a mild stroke. His short-term memory was affected, but as he looked across that great old ground where Jack Robertson had pulled him for six right after play resumed following the Regents Park buzz-bomb explosion in 1944, thought he shapes of the cricketers of 1994 were indistinct to him, his recall of distant times was clear. Did not Percy Chapman hammer a century down there against Australia in 1930?

A Kentishman, from Sidcup, he made his debut for the county in  1932 aged 17, but did not become a regular for another four years until  Tich Freeman's final season. By  1938, he was in the Test team against  Australia, and at  Leeds came close to bowling them to a remarkable victory, dismissing  Bradman,  McCabe and  Hassett as  Australia sought a mere 105 for victory. For most of his 34 Tests, he was bowling in difficult circumstances with little support. Often he "", "" the spin attack, as in  Australia in  1946-47 when he and  Bedser bowled almost 500 eight-ball overs between them. Against  South Africa at  Lord's in  1947, he took ten for 175, but there were many more days of abject frustration. \n"", ' Wright began as a quick bowler who liked to turn his wrist and slip in the odd spinner; later he reversed the proportions. But his quicker ball remained so fast that Godfrey Evans had to signal the slips to move deeper, and even his stock ball had a rare fizz to it. Everyone agreed - and  Bradman and  Hammond were among his chief admirers - that on his day  Wright was unplayable. But he gave the batsmen a chance to score too.  With his technique, wrote David Frith,  running in from over 15 yards, hopping and skipping as he went, and whipping over a wristy and finger-spun ball that would dip, bounce and deviate crazily off the pitch, to expect long-term accuracy was to display a dismal ignorance of physics. He never ever bowled a ball defensively, said Lord Cowdrey, his team-mate at Kent.  Every ball was bowled to take a wicket.', 'He took seven hat-tricks, more than anyone else in history, and 100 wickets in a season ten times. In  1954, Doug Wright became  Kent\'s first professional captain, though his natural diffidence did not obviously lend itself to leadership and, as so often in his career, he had a weak team around him:  Kent slid nearer the bottom each season. At the end of each day, he would take his shoes and socks off and apologise to his poor old feet.  ""Sorry, boys,"" he would say, ""but you\'re going to be needed again tomorrow."" He retired aged 43, and in 1959 succeeded George Geary as coach at Charterhouse. Everyone liked Doug Wright.  Cowdrey remembers him being asked about the best over he ever bowled.

6 ft 0 in ",,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,Coach,Father - ,,"['\nBob Woolmer was the most highly regarded cricket coach in the world. As a consequence he was employed by two leading Test nations, South Africa and Pakistan, and approached by two more, England and West Indies. In addition he was a good enough player to have been signed by Kerry Packer for World Series Cricket. Underpinning his abilities was a schoolboyish enthusiasm for the game matched in recent times, perhaps, by only Colin Cowdrey and Shane Warne. \n', ""Few individuals within the game have had to make so many contentious decisions. Joining Packer and hence forfeiting the chance of captaining Kent and England; signing up for the first breakaway tour of South Africa in the sure knowledge that a Test career would never be resumed; turning down the opportunity to coach England in 1999 when the ECB's first choice ahead of Duncan Fletcher. For such a mild-mannered\nman he was mired in undue controversy - and that was the case even before he met Hansie Cronje. Yet Woolmer never expressed any regret about the course of his life. "", 'It is sad, not least for his family, that such a talented cricketing man will be remembered, at least by those with a passing knowledge of the game, for the circumstances of his death and his association with Cronje, a man who let him down badly. For Woolmer to emerge from his partnership with Cronje with his reputation untainted was testimony to his honest nature. The essential point was that Woolmer would not have done \nanything to harm the game he loved. He liked his money - which Test cricketer of the mid-1970s did not, given how poor the remuneration was pre-Packer? - but he liked cricket even more. ', 'If he had had any knowledge of Cronje\'s involvement in match-fixing during his time as coach of South Africa and if there had been any such approach to his Pakistan players, then he would surely have reported it to the board and, doubtless, to the police too. As a natural conciliator, Woolmer would always reason rather than react. He did not have a temper. At The Oval last year, he asked every Pakistan player to swear on oath that he had not tampered with the ball. ""They all did and, as they are a religious bunch, I tended to believe them,"" he said shortly afterwards. ""I always feel the game should continue but to accuse Pakistan of cheating brings tensions to the fore. This kind of decision is\npotentially inflammatory. I was torn between my principles and a desire to help the side."" He was on the point of resigning as coach. In\nretrospect it was unfortunate he did not do so. ', ""One question that will engage the thoughts of English cricket followers is: would England have fared better had he become coach? The reason Woolmer did not take the job in 1999 was because he was immersed in trying to win the World Cup with South Africa. As to whether he would have taken it now, his love of the game, his desire to win a series against Australia - he never achieved this as a coach, although he did as a player - and the fact that he was not financially secure would all have inclined him to do so. The most probable scenario, though, assuming the ECB would have wanted a younger man as Fletcher's eventual successor, was that he would have founded his own cricket academy at a site he had earmarked near the Kruger Park in South Africa. This will now be established through a trust set up in his memory."", ""In his playing days and in his relationships with administrators and players when a coach Woolmer made friends easily, for all his obvious youthful ambition to play for England. Indeed, he was known in the Kent dressing room, which he joined in 1968, a time when the strongest side in the county's history was being forged, as 'Bobby England.' He was confident of his own ability, but it was submerged at first in a strong batting side. Woolmer's talents first became apparent in the one-day game, as a medium-paced swing bowler who would exert tight control in the middle of an innings with Derek Underwood at the other end. From 1975, when he made his Test debut for England, batting was his stronger suit."", 'Strange as it may seem now, there was something of the shop steward about him in his youth. He always liked the comfort of decent hotels, was keen on good food and wine and did not care for the ordinary accommodation that was the lot of the county cricketer in the 1970s. When  Woolmer signed for Packer in 1977, he was at his peak as a batsman. His three Test centuries were scored against good Australian sides and David Gower, for one, felt he fulfilled his talent. A total of 19 Tests with an average of 33.09, might suggest otherwise. For whatever reason, when\nWoolmer returned to international cricket in 1980, he was not the same performer and his Test career was over by 1981. He hooked and cover drove as well as anybody in his era, yet was a little loose technically, especially early in an innings, his prominent left arm leading into the drive being executed well in front of his body. ', 'If, arguably, he was just a little short of the highest level as a batsman, as a bowler Woolmer was under-used by England. In the modern era in one-day cricket he would have played in 200 or more internationals. As it was, his career was curtailed by a back injury in 1984, when he was still a fine county cricketer, surveying the field from slip as Arthur Fagg would have done - or Cowdrey. He was to return to Kent as coach in 1987 but insufficient time had passed since he had left the dressing room. Warwickshire were the beneficiaries and, once he had won three trophies in 1994 and shown he could handle Brian Lara, there was bound to be interest from a major Test nation.', 'As a batsman Woolmer will be recalled for his Cowdreyesque elegance; as a coach, for his innovations, his use of a laptop and the earpiece with which he once communicated with Cronje before it was banned; and as a person, for his gentleness, enthusiasm and generosity with his time and money. He gave too much of himself to too many people, some of whose motives he might not have recognised. Above all he was trusting of the human race.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1976'],19.0,34,2,1059.0,149,33.09,2734,38.73,3,2,131,2,10.0,0.0,6.0,4,0,21.0,9,5.25,46,45.65,0,0,1,0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,350.0,545,75,15772,203,33.55,,,34,71,,,239.0,1.0,290.0,235,35,4078,112*,20.39,,,1,17,,,98.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19.0,13,546,299,4.0,1/8,1/8,74.75,3.28,136.5,0,0,0,6.0,6,321,260,9.0,3/33,3/33,28.88,4.85,35.6,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,350.0,,25763,10868,420,7/47,,25.87,2.53,61.3,,12,1,290.0,,13461,7722,374,6/9,6/9,20.64,3.44,35.9,8,3,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

In a first-class career extending from 1906 to 1938 he hit 58,969 runs - a total exceeded only by Sir Jack Hobbs - including 145 centuries, to average 40.75; he took 2,066 wickets for 19.87 runs each, and he held 1,018 catches, mainly at slip, a record which remains unsurpassed. \n', 'Even more impressive than the number of runs Woolley amassed was the manner in which he made them. Standing well over six feet, he was a joy to watch. He played an eminently straight bat, employed his long reach to full advantage, and used his feet in a manner nowadays rarely seen. His timing of the ball approached perfection and he generally dealt surely with all types of bowling. Master of all the strokes, he was at his best driving, cutting, and turning the ball off his legs. He was described by Sydney Pardon as the cleanest driver since F. G. J. Ford, but he often started badly and there was something wanting in his defence. As a bowler he made good use of his height and bowled with a graceful easy swing.', 'As a small boy he was always to be found on the Tonbridge Cricket Ground, and his natural ability as batsman and bowler attracted so much attention that, in 1903, he was engaged to take part in the morning practice and play in a match or two in the afternoon if required. In the following year he became a regular member of the Tonbridge Ground staff, which in those days was the official Kent nursery. When given his first chance in the  Kent XI in 1906, he was almost unknown to the public, and his all-round form in his third match, against Surrey at  The Oval, came as nothing less than a revelation. To begin with, he took three Surrey wickets, clean bowling Hayward, Hayes, and Goatly. He then made 72, and when Surrey batted again he took five wickets for 80 runs. Finally he scored 23 not out, helping to win a wonderful game for Kent by one wicket. The match established his reputation.', 'When  Frank Woolley announced his retirement in 1938, I spent an afternoon with him at his home in Hildenborough where he talked about ""My happy cricket life."" In his first season with Kent they won the County Championship for the first time, and altogether between 1906 and 1913 they were top four times. Now let Woolley speak for himself as he told his story to me.', '""Those were the great days when plenty of amateurs could spare time for cricket. I do not believe there are so many good players in the game now as before the [First World] War. In the old days we were probably educated in cricket in a far more serious way than now. For the purpose of giving the younger people my idea of the difference, I will put up Walter Hammond, England\'s captain, as an example. Before 1914 there were something like 30 players up to his standard and he would have been in the England team only if at the top of his form. I make these remarks without casting the slightest reflection on  Hammond. He is a grand player and one of the greatest all-round cricketers since the War - in fact, the greatest.""', '""I doubt whether English cricket has really recovered from the effects of the War. You see, we missed half a generation and since then young men have found many other ways of occupying their leisure hours. Still, I believe it is only a passing phase and cricket will one day produce an abundance of great players.""', 'Unfortunately for cricket, within a year England was plunged into another war, and in my opinion the game in this country has only just shown signs of getting on its feet again with a stream of fine young players coming through, notably in the county of Kent. But to return to the Woolley interview as he saw the game 40 years ago.', '""There is little wrong with the game itself. Just a question of the way it is played. It is amazing how the public steadfastly refuse to attend the third day of a match when so often the last day produces the best and most exciting cricket.""', '""Touching on a personal subject I have been asked if I can explain why I was dismissed so many times in the `nineties\'. The statisticians inform me that I was out 35 times between 90 and 99 and I am also told that I am credited with 89 ducks. With regard to those `nineties\', I can honestly say that with me it was never a case of the `nervous nineties\'. Lots of times I was out through forcing the game. We were never allowed to play for averages in the Kent side or take half an hour or more to get the last ten runs under normal conditions. We always had to play the game and play for the team. It is a Kent tradition.""', '""As a matter of fact I consider the two finest innings I ever played were in the second Test against Australia in 1921 when I was out for 95 and 93. I don\'t think I ever worked harder at any match during my career to get runs as I did then, nor did I ever have to face in one game such consistently fast bowlers as the Australian pair, Gregory and McDonald. Square cuts which ordinarily would have flashed to the boundary earned only two, and I believe that those two innings would have been worth 150 apiece in a county match.""', '""I was not depressed when they got me out. I have always taken my dismissals as part of the game. In the first innings I was in the `eighties\' when I was joined by the last man, Jack Durston. It was my own fault completely that I lost my wicket. Mailey bowled me a full toss to the off; I walked down the pitch, stepping to the on to face the ball past extra cover, I missed it, and that fine wicketkeeper, H. Carter, eagerly accepted the opportunity to stump me. I was rather unlucky in the second innings when again I fell to  Mailey. The ball stuck in his hand and dropped half-way on the leg side. I hit it pretty plumb between square leg and mid-on and just there was standing `Stalky\' Hendry. As I made the shot he jumped in the air and up went his right hand. The ball hit him, I think, on the wrist, and he lost his balance. The ball went up ten feet and as he was lying on the ground it fell in his lap and he caught it. He was the only man on the leg side and I think the shot would have carried for six. It was a marvellous catch.""', '""It is often argued that left-handed batsmen have an advantage compared with the right-handers. I do not agree. When the turf is worn the right-hand leg-break bowlers and left-arm slow bowlers are able to pitch the ball into the footholes of the bowlers who have operated at the other end. Right-handed batsmen can let these balls hit their pads, but the left-handers must use their bats. Perhaps the new [1937] lbw rule has not helped us there, but the amended law does not worry me, though in my opinion it has not improved the game. As for further extending the lbw rule I think it would make a farce of the game.""', '""In many quarters surprise was expressed that at the age of 51 I went in number one. Until then I had never been in first regularly, though I had always preferred that place. Beginning as a bowler made Kent place me four or five in the order, and moreover the county were always rich in opening batsmen. Consequently my wish to start the innings was denied until 1938.""', '""Because Kent have experienced their bad times against fast bowling [there were very few bouncers in those days] the cry has gone round that we cannot play the fast men, but I think if you search the records you will also find that Kent have hit a tremendous lot of runs off fast bowling. Again I must emphasise that Kent always endeavour to play sporting cricket, and trying to make runs off that type of bowling must sometimes have contributed to our downfall. It was never a policy of the Kent team that the pitch ', ' be occupied all day after winning the toss.""', '""I cannot let this opportunity pass without placing on record how much I have enjoyed my cricket with  Kent. If I was a youngster starting as a batsman I think I should like to play always at The Oval, but the Kent grounds, with their natural decorations of beautiful trees, members\' tents flying their own colours and bedecked with flowers, lend the right tone to cricket.""', 'After his retirement from the field, Woolley was elected a life member of M.C.C. and Kent, and also to the county committee. He was quite active into his late 80s and in January 1971 flew to Australia to watch the last two Tests. Nine months later, in Canada, he married for a second time, his first wife having died ten years earlier. His second bride was Mrs Martha Morse, an American widow.', 'Frank Woolley was a slow left-arm bowler with a beautiful action who took over 2,000 wickets and was at one time perhaps the best of his type in the world. He caught during his career far more catches than anyone else, except wicketkeepers, yet it is as a batsman that he is primarily remembered. Few now alive have seen a player who approached him in ease and grace, and his average rate of scoring has been exceeded only by Jessop and equalled by Trumper. His philosophy was to dominate the bowler. ""When I am batting,"" he said, ""', ' am the attack."" I was lucky enough to see him innumerable times. Obviously I often saw him out for small scores, but I never saw him in difficulties. If a ball beat him, the next would probably go for four or six.', 'This was made possible not only by his wonderful eye and sense of timing but by his range of strokes. He had every orthodox stroke at his command and no preference for one over another. Like W.G., he simply employed the one the occasion demanded. Each of these strokes could be commended to a young player as the perfect example of how to do it. In defence, too, his back stroke, certainly in his maturer years, was a model of soundness. All types of bowler came alike to him personally, but, if he saw his partner in trouble, he would make it his business to settle the bowler responsible.', 'At Tunbridge Wells in 1924, he came in at 29 for two to join George Wood, who was in grievous difficulties with Tate, then at his best. As he passed  Wood, he said: ""Push a single, Mr Wood, and leave me to deal with Chubby."" The single was duly obtained and Tate\'s next two balls were driven for four. Great trier though he was, Tate, always demonstrative, flung the ball down, exclaiming, ""I can\'t bowl to this chap."" Wood, a useful though not great bat, went on to make 49, Woolley made 87, and together they put on 103 out of a total of 190. Though  Kent won by 200 runs, it is not fanciful to suggest that those two early fours had a considerable effect on the course of the match.', 'At Folkestone in 1928, an  England XI required 286 to beat the West Indies. There was a bit of feeling in the air, and the three fast bowlers,  Francis, Constantine, and Griffith, set out to intimidate the batsmen. Lee and Hammond were quickly out and Wyatt, though struggling with typical determination, was acutely uncomfortable. Woolley, as if unconscious of any trouble, set about the bowlers from the start and hit them to every corner of that large ground. Never have I seen fast bowling so massacred. He scored 151 in three hours. Wyatt compiled a gallant 75, and against all the odds the England side won by four wickets. Years later Constantine said it was the worst hammering he ever received.', 'The feelings of an opposing captain on such occasions were succinctly expressed by Woodfull: ""He made the game look so untidy. It appeared as if the wrong bowlers were on and the fieldsmen all in the wrong places."" One can see why Woolley could be a far greater menace to the opposition than players with higher averages, and why 40 years after his retirement he is mentioned in print more than any other batsman of his time except Bradman. And if some statistically minded reader says, ""But wouldn\'t he have been a greater player had he exercised a bit more caution?"" I am sure that all who saw him, and, even more, all who played with him would answer firmly, No.\n']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1911', 'Walter Lawrence Trophy 1934']",64.0,98,7,3283.0,154,36.07,,,5,23,,15,64.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,978.0,1530,84,58959,305*,40.77,,,145,295,,,1018.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,64.0,87,6495,2815,83.0,7/76,10/49,33.91,2.60,78.2,1,4,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,978.0,,94949,41058,2066,8/22,,19.87,2.59,45.9,,132,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He is skinny, barely 6ft tall and bowls from a sprinter's run-up but after his speed caught the eye with Durham and the Lions, he was given a Test debut at the start of the 2015 summer. He made an instant impression against New Zealand, bowling above 90mph and celebrating wickets with abandon, kept his place for the visit of Australia and capped things off by taking the wicket that sealed England's Ashes victory at Trent Bridge. In no time at all, the imaginary horse that had ridden around the county grounds of England to stave off boredom had become a recognisable part of his England celebration. Here was a fast bowler of unsuppressed vitality. \n"", 'Like Stephen Harmison, Wood hails from Ashington in Northumberland and played for the same club. The former England quick also encouraged him to go to Australia at 18 to improve his game - not bad advice from a man who suffered bouts of homesickness away from the Northumberland coast. Where Harmison stands 6ft 4in tall, Wood is a level 6ft and delivers a whippier, skiddier ball. In his first five first-class appearances, he took 19 wickets at 21.63, including a match-winning 5 for 78 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in August 2012.', ""Paul Collingwood's appetite for promoting and encouraging Durham's younger crop of players worked in his favour in 2013. He had a breakthrough summer, claiming 27 first-class wickets at 24.07 to help Durham to the Championship title and confirm his status as the latest in an impressive collection of homegrown pace bowlers. That strong showing was enough to win recognition on the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka, though it lasted only one match before he returned home with a side injury. His 2014 season was further disrupted by the first appearance of a long-running ankle problem but he was again involved with the Lions at the start of 2015 before being called up to the Test squad for the Caribbean."", ""He did not get a run against West Indies but was capped in the washed-out ODI against Ireland, picking up his first England wicket, and then replaced Chris Jordan in the Test side for a Lord's debut. Wood thought he had taken the wicket of Martin Guptill in his third over, only for replays to show he had overstepped, but he eventually finished with 4 for 140 as England won a thriller. Further limited-overs involvement followed but England were already aware Wood's workload would need careful managing - he played the first two Ashes Tests but missed out at Edgbaston. James Anderson's side strain allowed him to return at Trent Bridge and he took one of the two wickets not claimed by Stuart Broad as Australia were dismissed for 60. Two days later, the imaginary horse got an outing after Wood took the wicket that secured the return of the urn."", ""He made a blistering comeback from injury in the second half of 2016, delivering some of the most potent fast-bowling spells of the season as he helped Durham's to the final of the NatWest T20 Blast and also featured in England's 4-1 victory over Pakistan in their one-day international series. But further ankle issues ruled him out of a tour to Bangladesh and he missed India, too, after it was discovered that he bowled at the tail end of the English domestic season when his ankle was fractured. It all meant that he faced a third ankle operation within a year and, however optimistic the prognosis, cast doubts upon the resilience of a player who had won a reputation as England's fastest bowler. His comeback in 2017 was then afflicted by heel problems which limited him to five early-season Championship matches, somewhat down on pace, and saw him lose his England central contract at the end of the season."", ""Lost England contract or not, England could not resist his potential. He sandwiched a disastrous debut in the IPL (conceding 49 in four overs for Chennai Super Kinds and never seen again) in between Tests in Christchurch and against Pakistan at Lord's, where his average pace  of 87mph restated his threat, but his ODI displays were unpredictable and he admitted in Sri Lanka that he was running out of opportunities to claim his place for the 2019 World Cup. He experimented with a longer run up to try to combat his injuries."", 'Wood played minor counties cricket for Northumberland from 2008 to 2010 before making his first-class debut for Durham against Durham MCCU in April 2011.

It looked as if he may be remembered as one of England's nearly men. \n"", 'But fate offered another chance. A knee injury to Ben Stokes saw Woakes recalled to the squad to play Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street. On the same day he claimed career-best figures of 9 for 36 against Durham - ""It was like facing 90mph leg-breaks,"" Paul Collingwood said - and, with Alastair Cook insisting Woakes\' batting gave him the edge (both Paul Farbrace and Trevor Bayliss wanted Jake Ball to play), he made it back into the XI.', ""It was to prove the start of a golden summer. After career-bests (up to that point) with bat and ball at Chester-le-Street, he made a maiden Test half-century at Lord's and followed it with an unbeaten 95 to help England to an unlikely tie in an ODI at Trent Bridge. It was the highest score by a No. 8 or lower in the history of ODIs and helped England recover from 92 for 6 in pursuit of 287."", ""Then, at Lord's, he claimed 11 for 102 against Pakistan, becoming the first England bowler since Ian Botham in 1978 to take a five-wicket haul in each innings of a Test at the ground. He followed it with another seven wickets and a half-century in Manchester and five more wickets in Birmingham. His 26 wickets at 16.73 apiece were a record in a series between England and Pakistan. Woakes, finally, had arrived at the top level. He was named one of "", ""'s Cricketers of the Year for his efforts."", 'In many ways it was a surprise it had taken so long. Woakes had long been a highly respected player at county level. He made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in 2006 as a 17-year-old and, before he was 20, was topping the county\'s bowling averages (45 wickets at 20.48 in 2008) with impressive control and an ability to swing the ball both ways. Most of all, though, he impressed with an apparently unflappable temperament that Ashley Giles, director of cricket at Warwickshire, admitted he would like ""to clone"" as the template for all players.', 'After two more solid county seasons, he was selected on the England Lions tour of the West Indies in 2010, where he performed admirably and was deemed ready for the next step. He made his international debut in a T20 in Adelaide in January 2011 and kept his cool to hit the winning runs in a thrilling one-wicket victory. A few weeks later, he claimed 6 for 45 at Brisbane - the second-best figures by an Englishman in ODIs. ', 'Back in the UK, Woakes enjoyed another superb summer in first-class cricket with 56 wickets at 21.78 and 579 runs at 48.25. Most of his chances for England came with the white ball, playing spasmodically over the next couple of years, before being handed a Test debut at the end of the 2013 Ashes. He performed respectably on a flat pitch, but it was felt he lacked the pace to prosper at Test level and he was left out of the Ashes squad for the return tour to Australia. ', 'Having worked hard to add that pace, Woakes was recalled in place of Stokes in the summer of 2014 and played three Test in succession against India.

A hard, fearless man from the north-east, he made 15 of his 26 Test appearances against the West Indies and 13 of his 26 one-day internationals against the same opposition. The rest of his one-day  internationals were against Australia, as were nine of his Tests. He did not have many easy opportunities to bolster his average. \n', ""In fairness, he wasn't quite good enough as a specialist batsman, and his bowling not penetrative enough to make him a genuine allrounder. But his courage was beyond question, and his two Test hundreds, both against West Indies, were made when others had proved less stubborn in the face of a pace battering.  That he was seen as a back-against-the-wall specialist  is shown by the fact that 15 of his 26 Tests and 13 of his 26 one-dayers came against West Indies in their prime - all but two of the other Tests and ODIs came against Australia.  In those two Tests - against India and New Zealand - he averaged over 40.

Generally respected as a top umpire, he declined the opportunity to go onto the ICC list of elite umpires because of the excessive time that would have taken him away from home, but his standing in the international game and his experience from the 1999 event made him an obvious choice when the elite list needed supplementing for the 2003 World Cup.\n""]",[],26.0,50,6,1184.0,102*,26.9,2794,42.37,2,5,160,4,3.0,0.0,26.0,24,1,538.0,64,23.39,855,62.92,0,5,49,0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,559.0,918,121,24361,227,30.56,,,44,101,,,235.0,0.0,458.0,436,43,11105,154,28.25,,,10,67,,,124.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.0,20,1091,456,7.0,2/73,2/73,65.14,2.50,155.8,0,0,0,26.0,22,1031,659,13.0,3/33,3/33,50.69,3.83,79.3,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,559.0,,58635,23400,756,7/37,,30.95,2.39,77.5,,26,3,458.0,,18520,11143,347,4/17,4/17,32.11,3.61,53.3,4,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Sir Tim Rice presented both of us with his brother Jonathan's book, One Hundred Lord's Tests, a happy reminder of the stand we had shared in against the Australians 50 years before. It was a delightful reunion, but sadly it was the last time we would meet as Willie died in Johannesburg, South Africa, on April 24, aged 84. However, many happy memories linger on. After all, we had toured the Caribbean and Australia together, I bowled against him for Essex, batted with him for England and trained with him on the Scarborough football ground before breakfast during the cricket festival, which was painful after several heavy nights. \n"", 'Willie was a superb natural athlete and ball player who glided over football and cricket fields with both grace and pace. He was one of that very small select band who represented England at both cricket and football. This is something that will never happen again as football and indeed rugby have invaded the summer.', 'I believe Willie would have made more appearances at both cricket and football, if he had not spent five years in his late teens and early 20s in the army, instead of being coached by Yorkshire and Huddersfield Town Football Club. Our finest batsmen after the hostilities, Hutton, Compton and Edrich, had all established themselves at Test level in the late 1930s.', 'Willie was originally an inside-forward but became a wing-half when he signed for Sunderland in 1946. He played for England on four occasions in 1949 when he was better known for his football than his cricket and was also included in the English squad for the World Cup in Brazil in 1950. He did not play in a match, however, probably because his manager wanted a defensive rather than an attacking wing-half. What impressed Willie out there was the artistry and the footwork displayed by all of the South American footballers, not just their forwards.', 'Although Willie made his first appearance for Yorkshire in 1939, it was not until the War ended and he was released from the army that he established himself as a dependable, attractive middle-order stroke player and an outstanding athletic fielder in an era when the fielding was poor compared with present standards. Although the Yorkshire batting was always strong, it seemed to include good players that promised much but never quite made it, like Gerald Smithson who was picked for the 1947-48 West Indian tour. Although Willie soon became a permanent member in his county side he was never a regular fixture for England, probably due to a batting average of 25.85 in 23 Tests.', ""Originally he was known for his football more than his cricket, but this ended at Lord's against the Australians when I joined him on the last day with the score at 73 for 4. We remained together for almost four hours, while Willie was at the crease for 346 minutes. He completed his century, the match was eventually drawn and he became a legend. Our partnership did illustrate that in certain circumstances a draw can be very exciting as spectators came through the turnstiles after lunch on the fifth day of a game that appeared lost. Sadly Willie was not chosen for the final Test when we regained the Ashes and he was picked for England again spasmodically. Willie joined Leicestershire in 1958, for whom he scored heavily and led with much charm until he retired in 1964."", 'In the 1950s Willie became player-manager of Halifax and later returned as manager in 1964 after a two-year stint as an England Test selector, and he also had a spell in charge of Bradford. In 1968 he found the perfect job for him as coach and administrator of the Wanderers in Johannesburg. It really was an ideal appointment and, not surprisingly with his knowledge and background, he settled very contentedly.', 'I count myself lucky to have known Willie so well. A delightful companion both on and off the field, whenever I had the good fortune to go to South Africa we would meet and simply talk and chuckle about the past, the present and the future as we quietly sipped a drink.\n', ""\nWillie Watson, who died on April 24, 2004, at his home in Johannesburg at the age of 84, was a graceful and correct left-hander who scored over 25,000 runs in a first-class career that spanned 25 years. He will probably be best remembered for a match-saving century in the 1953 Lord's Test against Australia, when his 109 - and his long partnership with Trevor Bailey - staved off what had seemed to be certain defeat."", ""Born in Bolton-on-Dearne in Yorkshire in 1920, Watson was a fine allround sportsman. Apart from cricket, in which he made his debut for Yorkshire in 1939, he was also a fine footballer. He played for Huddersfield, Sunderland and Halifax, and won four England caps. He was part of the first England squad that took part in the World Cup, in Brazil in 1950, although he didn't actually play a match. The following year he made his England Test debut, against South Africa at Trent Bridge, scoring 57 in his first match and 79 in his second. But Watson was jostling for a position with the likes of Hutton, Compton, Edrich, May, Graveney and Cowdrey, in a golden era of English batting, and found it difficult to nail down a regular place in the side. Even after that hundred on debut against Australia at Lord's in 1953, when his four-hour stand of 163 with Bailey saved the game, Watson wasn't secure: he was dropped before the end of the series, and missed the deciding final Test at The Oval, which England won to recapture the Ashes after 19 years."", ""Football commitments at an end, Watson toured West Indies in 1953-54, and added a second Test century in Jamaica. He flitted in and out of the Test side until the end of the decade, playing his last Tests in Australasia in 1958-59, when one of his team-mates was another double cricket/football international, Arthur Milton. Watson finished with 879 runs from his 23 Tests, at an average of 25.85. By then Watson was playing his county cricket for Leicestershire, whom he'd joined as assistant secretary and captain in 1958. He played on to 1964, finishing with 25,670 runs in all (39.86), including 55 centuries. His highest score was 257, for MCC against British Guiana at Georgetown in 1953-54, when he shared a stand of 402 with Tom Graveney, who made 231. In England Watson's best was 217 not out, for Leicestershire against Somerset at Taunton in 1961, when he shared an unbroken third-wicket stand of 316 with Alan Wharton, which remained a county record until 2003. And he carried his bat for his new county against his old one in 1959, scoring 79 not out in Leicestershire's total of 132 against Yorkshire at Grace Road. That season - which ironically followed what turned out to be his last Test appearance - proved to be his most prolific one, as he passed 2000 runs for the first time and finished with 2212 at 55.30."", 'Watson was a Test selector for three years from 1962, and emigrated to South Africa in 1968 to coach at the Wanderers club in Johannesburg.

December 6, 1914, Barrow, Clitheroe, Lancashire ","April 27, 1999, Sale, Cheshire (aged 84 years 142 days) ",,"['England,', 'Lancashire']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"['\nCyril Washbrook, who died on April 27, 1999, aged 84, was an always staunch and sometimes brilliant opening batsman for  Lancashire and  England. He flourished either side of the Second World War, and his name will for ever be paired in history with that of  Len Hutton, with whom he opened for  England 51 times. Their average partnership was 60, which from this distance seems like unparalleled riches, although they played in often perilous times for  England. In the popular imagination, he is remembered for two other things. One was his comeback in 1956 when, as a selector, he made a dramatic return to the Test team, aged 41. The other was the jaunty angle of his cap which hinted at a carefree nature. In fact, he was a diffident man, and he masked this by acquiring a rather forbidding exterior as he gained authority. \n', 'His cricket, however, gave pleasure right from the start. In his second match for Lancashire, as an 18-year-old in 1933,  Washbrook made 152, and Neville Cardus wrote in the ', "":  He looks like a cricketer, has a cricketer's face and wears his flannels like a cricketer. He went on to become the very embodiment of a Lancashire cricketer, and remained deeply associated with the county until his sad and lingering final illness."", "" Washbrook was born in Barrow, near Clitheroe, but his family moved to Shropshire. From Bridgnorth Grammar School, he might have gone to either Warwickshire or Worcestershire or, since he had many gifts, Wolves or West Bromwich Albion. But when he arrived at  Old Trafford, the old opener Harry Makepeace, now coach, took him under his wing as his protégé and successor. After his brilliant start, however,  Washbrook fell back somewhat and it was 1935 before he finally established himself in the side, hitting 1,724 runs and coming fifth in the national averages. He was still dropped once from the side in 1936, to Cardus's disgust. A year later he made his  England debut, alongside  Denis Compton, at  The Oval against  New Zealand in  1937. But he made only nine and eight not out, and missed the opportunity for the then infinitely greater honour of a Test against  Australia the following year."", 'In the war,  Washbrook was a PT instructor in the RAF, and he was 30 before he was at last able to fulfil his destiny. In  Australia in  1946-47, he and  Hutton had three successive century stands, and  Washbrook emerged as one of the recognisable cricketers of a heroic cricketing age:  the chin, always square and thrust out a little, wrote Cardus,  the square shoulders, the pouting chest, the cock of cricket cap, his easy loose movement, his wonderful swoop at cover and the deadly velocity of his throw in. The tensing of his shoulders as he prepared to face the bowling, the preliminary champing of his feet - every sign of determined awareness, every sign of combined attack and defence, his mind ready to signal swiftly either to infantry, cavalry, or for cover behind the sand bags.', 'He was, from the start, strongest on the  leg side and was one of the great hookers and pullers; he also had a ferocious  square cut. No fast bowler ever changed his demeanour.  He was like concrete, said Wilfred Wooller.  Washbrook was in his pomp in the late 1940s. He scored six Test centuries of varying moods, but roughly equal quality. The first came against  Australia at  Melbourne in  1946-47, where a huge crowd saw him battle six hours for 112. He got another at  Headingley in  1948, where he hit what ', "" called an  almost faultless 143 in the Ashes match where  England reached 423 for two but still lost. Five months later, in  South Africa,  Hutton and  Washbrook put on 359, still an  England first-wicket record, in 290 minutes on the first day of Test cricket at  Ellis Park.  Washbrook made a chanceless 195, his highest Test score. He hit an unbeaten 103, mostly with a runner, against  New Zealand at  Leeds in  1949 and scored two more centuries, both in defeat, in the  1950 series against  West Indies. He was apparently reluctant to tour  Australia in 1950-51, and it showed: he was also troubled by the  mystery spinner, Jack Iverson. From then on, he faded out of the Test team (apparently against  Hutton's wishes when he was captain). In  1954 he became  Lancashire's first professional captain and in 1956 a Test selector."", ""The historic moment came that July, after  England had lost to  Australia at  Lord's. More than five years after his last Test appearance, his colleagues on the selection panel requested him to leave the room. On his return, they asked if he would play at Headingley. He was 41, and the decision was greeted first with astonishment and then with delight.  Washbrook made 98, sharing a stand of 187 with  May after  England had been reduced to 17 for three.  England won the game, and  Washbrook stayed in the team to play less heroic roles as  Jim Laker worked his magic at  Manchester and gave  England the best of a  draw at  The Oval.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1947'],37.0,66,6,2569.0,195,42.81,,,6,12,,8,12,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,592.0,906,107,34101,251*,42.67,,,76,176,,,212,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37.0,2,36,33,1.0,1/25,1/25,33.0,5.50,36.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,592.0,,474,309,7,2/8,,44.14,3.91,67.7,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He was 89. \n', 'When I was a small boy my father purchased a secondhand copy of ', ' by P.F. Warner at the modest price of sixpence.', ""It was my first cricket book and I devoured every word of it; indeed I almost knew the book by heart. I imagined myself playing Bridge with F.L. Fane on the voyage out to New Zealand -- the book was an account of the tour of Lord Hawke's team in New Zealand and Australia -- I enjoyed the scenery and I was horrified by A.D. Whatman, one of the wicketkeepers of the team, being so engrossed in a book "", ' by Christian de Wet during the match against Otago that he did not watch the cricket at all.', 'A wicket fell, and a companion nudged the bookworm, appraising him of the fact. He sauntered into the pavilion, padded up -- and returned to his book. Another wicket fell, another nudge, and Whatman strolled out to the wicket. He played the first ball, but no doubt still thinking of the book he played all over the second one and there was a crash of timber. The book had won! I never forgave Whatman for that episode.', 'I had entered a new world, but never in my wildest dreams did I think that I was destined to spend well over thirty supremely happy years in the closest possible contact with the author as his assistant on ', 'In the 1921 ', ' Sydney Pardon wrote ""There have been many greater cricketers than Pelham Warner but none more devoted to the game. Nothing has ever damped his enthusiasm. Whether winning or losing he has always been the same.""', 'With that verdict I imagine few, if any, students of the game will disagree, but in his prime, and in good health, Pelham Warner was a very fine batsman indeed as his record, especially against the redoubtable  Yorkshire XIs of his era, testifies.', ""Pelham Francis Warner was born on the island of Trinidad in the West Indies on October 2, 1873, and he died on January 30, 1963. His father, Charles William Warner, C.B., for many years Attorney General of Trinidad, was born two days before the battle of Trafalgar so father and son between them saw warships develop from the three deckers of Nelson's time to the present day atomic submarine -- an astounding thought."", 'Excluding the handicap of ill health Sir Pelham had a remarkably happy life and received virtually every honour the game has to offer, on and off the field.', 'He often used to relate that his first recollections of cricket were of batting on a marble gallery at his home, The Hall, Port of Spain, Trinidad, to the bowling of a black boy who rejoiced in the name of Killebree (Humming Bird). At thirteen and a half he came to England, but before that he had three years at Harrison College, Barbados, and at thirteen had gained a place in the first XI.', 'On May 20, 1887, he paid his first visit to Lord\'s to see M.C.C. play Sussex. On August Bank Holiday he saw The Oval for the first time, and the following month he entered Whitelaw\'s House at Rugby where he was in the XI for four years, being captain in 1892. He had the good fortune to be coached by that amusing character Tom Emmett, who taught him to play back in the right way and how to attack the half volley, saying ""if you come to her, come. You may as well be stumped by two feet as by one inch.""', 'Sir Pelham never tired of recalling his Rugby days, and so, vividly did he portray his contemporaries that I almost felt that l knew them personally, particularly a certain Sam Slater, a useful bowler, who laughed his way through five years at Rugby. It was at Rugby that Pelham developed into Plum.', 'Going up to Oxford, where he was at Oriel, he did not get his Blue until his third year when his captain, G.J. Mordaunt, said to him: ""Plum, I think you would look very nice in a dark blue cap."" Influenza had interfered with his prospects during his first two summers.', ""He was not particularly successful in his two University matches, making 22 and 4 in 1895, and 10 and 17 in 1896, being run out in each innings. The 1896 match was memorable for Cambridge giving away 12 extras to prevent Oxford following on (compulsory in those days) and for G.O. Smith's superb 132 which enabled Oxford to make 330 for six and win by four wickets."", 'It was in 1894 that Sir Pelham made his debut for Middlesex, playing against Somerset at Taunton on August 6, 7 and 8. He scored 6 and 4 and Middlesex won an exciting game by 19 runs. Curiously enough his last innings against Somerset at Taunton was also 6. His next match was against Gloucestershire and W.G. arrived on the ground wearing a morning coat over white flannel trousers and a black hat, half topper and half bowler -- a wonderful sartorial effort.', 'Sir Pelham took his Bar final examination in 1896, and in subsequent years he often stated in his speeches that ""I am by courtesy my learned friend."" It was one of my great privileges to lunch with him on numerous occasions in the Inner Temple and to be fascinated by the brilliant conversation.', 'The whole course of his life was altered by Lord Hawke\'s invitation to tour the West Indies, and on January 13, 1897, he began the first of many journeys across the seas. As it happened the opening match was against Trinidad and he had the distinction of scoring 119, the first hundred that had ever been scored in the Island in an important match. Scores of black men rushed across the ground at the end of his innings shouting out ""I taught you, Mr. Pelham. You play well, Sir; we are proud of you.""', ""On his return from the West Indies, he made his first hundred in a first-class match at his beloved Lord's -- 108 not out against  Yorkshire. This was the first of many fine innings against  Yorkshire, and he was justifiably proud of his record against that county; indeed he rarely failed against them as a perusal of the records will show."", 'Furthermore, he had a sincere affection for many of the Yorkshire players, particularly Hirst and Haigh, who were inseparable friends. David Hunter, the old Yorkshire wicketkeeper, paid him a splendid compliment when he said ""Ah, Mr. Warner, you play Wilfred (Rhodes) better than anyone else."" This remark was made when Sir Pelham was batting against Yorkshire on a very false wicket at Bradford. He scored 48 in a total of 87.', 'Sir Pelham owed a great deal to Lord Hawke and he had an intense admiration and affection for The Baron, whose ""Is it quite the same Plum who left us in September? Has England discovered a great leader?"" uttered after the triumphant 1903-04 tour, had a lifelong influence on him. As Sir Pelham wrote in ', "", flattery like this is intoxicating wine. I well remember his grief when he learnt of Lord Hawke's death."", ""The visit to the  West Indies with Lord Hawke's team had infected him with the travel bug and in 1897, at the age of 23, he took a side to America. It was on this tour that he first met J.B. King who was the first of the right arm in-swing bowlers and one of the greatest bowlers of all time. It was also on this tour that the following verses appeared in a long poem about the team:"", 'At one end stocky  Jessop frowned', 'The human catapult', 'Who wrecks the roofs of distant towns', 'When set in his assault', 'His mate was that perplexing man', 'We know as Looshun Gore', ""It isn't spelt at all that way"", ""We don't know what it's for"", ""In the spring of 1898 he toured Portugal with T. Westray's side. At the end of the season he led another team to America and included Canada, and in December sailed for South Africa as a member of Lord Hawke's team, scoring 132 not out in the first Test match at Johannesburg."", ""Back from South Africa, and feeling very fit, he played one of the finest innings of his life when he scored 150 against Yorkshire at Lord's and by now had established himself as one of the leading batsmen in the country."", 'He more than maintained his improved form in the 1900 season which he began with 83 and 69 for M.C.C. against Yorkshire, 114 for Middlesex against Sussex and 146 for Middlesex against Lancashire. In this match a nasty blow on the left shin from Mold kept him out of cricket for the next three weeks, and when he went to play for the touring West Indies side against Leicestershire, incidentally making 113, a ball from Woodcock, almost as fast as Mold, struck him on his injured shin and he was laid up once more.', ""But for these injuries he would almost certainly have played for the Gentlemen v. Players at Lord's. As it was he scored five centuries for Middlesex and in 18 matches for the county made 1,335 runs, average 44.50. "", ' enthused over his skill in playing fast bowling.', ""In 1901 Sir Pelham was chosen for the Gentlemen at Lord's and a successful début it was. He helped C.B. Fry to put on 105 in the first innings for the opening partnership, and in the second innings his 48 was top score for the Gentlemen."", 'He was a great advocate for the retention of Gentlemen v. Players and in his preface to Gentlemen v.  Players, 1806-1949 he wrote ""I am indeed fortunate to have lived to attempt to give some sort of history of an historic match which began long before Test matches were dreamed of, and which I pray, and believe, will never die out."" Mercifully he died the day before the decision was made to call all players cricketers which, of course, meant the termination of the historic match.', ""The year 1902 saw Sir Pelham once more on his travels, this time as captain of Lord Hawke's team to New Zealand and Australia, Lord Hawke himself being unable to go at the last minute owing to the illness of his mother."", 'This tour, although in many ways only of minor importance -- many of the New Zealand matches being against odds -- was destined to have a far-reaching and historic influence on the future of cricket. While the team were playing in Australia at the conclusion of the New Zealand fixtures it was suggested that he should bring out the next side to Australia (it was the custom in those days for tours to be privately organised). He replied ""Ask the M.C.C. They are the proper body."" And thus it came about that the M.C.C. took over the organisation of official overseas tours.', 'When it was announced that Sir Pelham had been appointed captain of the first M.C.C. touring team, F.S. Jackson having stated that he was not available, there was considerable criticism as at the time he had not played in a Test match in England, and A.C. MacLaren was considered by many as the only possible choice.', 'However, all was well in the end, and although MacLaren, Fry, Ranji and Jackson were not available, all the best professionals were able to accept and Sir Pelham had the assistance of the following players: R.E. Foster, B.J.T. Bosanquet, A.A. Lilley, G.H. Hirst, T. Hayward, W. Rhodes, L.C. Braund, J.T. Tyldesley, H. Strudwick, E.G. Arnold, A.E. Relf, A. Fielder and A.E. Knight. One well-known critic of the time wrote that ""when they return beaten five-love they will be more than ever the laughing stock of cricketing England.""', ""Contrary to this critic's doleful prediction England won the rubber 3-2, Bosanquet's googlies playing a prominent part in the success. Clem Hill went so far as to state that if England had not had Bosanquet Australia would have won the rubber. "", 'In the fourth Test, which decided the fate of the Ashes, Bosanquet had a second innings analysis of six for 51. Apart from captaining the side with the greatest possible skill, Sir Pelham played his part well as a batsman, helping Hayward in opening stands of 122 at  Melbourne and 148 at Adelaide.', 'On his return from  Australia he was honoured with a place on the M.C.C. committee, and a year later he was appointed captain of the first M.C.C. side to tour South Africa.', 'It was a good, but by no means a representative team and South Africa won 4-1 after a titanic struggle in the first Test at Johannesburg where South Africa triumphed by one wicket and beat England for the first time in a Test match. To his dying day I do not think he ever quite forgave that most accurate of bowlers, A.E. Relf, for sending down a full toss to leg to P.W. Sherwell when the scores were level.  ', 'South Africa had a wonderful array of googly bowlers at that time -- R.O. Schwarz, G.A. Faulkner, A.E. Vogler and G.C. White -- and Sir Pelham, as he frankly admitted, was unable to cope with them on the matting wickets.', 'Back in England, he soon regained his best form, and the following season, the very wet one of 1907, found him missing top place in the averages by only a fraction, C.B. Fry making 1449 runs, average 46.74 against his 1891 runs, average 46.12.', 'He considered the best innings he ever played on a good wicket was his 149 against Surrey at The Oval that season, the opposing bowlers being N.A. Knox, W. Lees, J.N. Crawford and T. Rushby. At lunch on the first day he was 115 not out. He and J. Douglas put on 232 for the first wicket in two and a half hours!', 'He succeeded G. MacGregor in the captaincy of the Middlesex side in 1908 and held the position until his retirement at the end of the 1920 season.', 'The summer of 1908 was an outstanding one for him, his Middlesex record being 1,298 runs, average 54.08, including five centuries, but perhaps his greatest performance that year was his 64 not out in a total of 95 for M.C.C. on a sticky wicket against a Yorkshire attack consisting of Hirst, Rhodes, Haigh and  Newstead. He considered this his best innings on a bad wicket, and M.C.C. evidently concurred as they presented him with two bats in appreciation.', 'Duodenal trouble worried him during the 1909 summer, but he was selected for the Old Trafford Test against Australia -- his first Test in England -- and scored 9 and 25 in a drawn game which was played on a slow wicket.', ""The summers of 1910 and  1911 were fine ones for Sir Pelham who in the latter year not only scored over 2,000 runs for the first time in his life, but when playing for England against the Champion County, Warwickshire, reached the highest score of his career, 244. He hit thirty-five 4's and batted for five hours and twenty minutes."", 'This great innings was the prelude to his second visit to Australia as captain of an  M.C.C. team. This time he had with him J.W.H.T. Douglas,  F.R. Foster, W. Rhodes, J.B. Hobbs, H. Strudwick, J.W. Hitch, S.P. Kinneir, E.J. Smith, G. Gunn, J. Iremonger,  S.F. Barnes, C.P. Mead, J. Vine, F.E. Woolley and J.W. Hearne. Five of the team were under 25 when they left  England and Hitch was only four months over that age.', 'In the first match of the tour against South Australia he scored 151, but it was, alas, the only innings he played on the tour as he was struck down by a serious illness. England won the series 4-1 with what many people consider the strongest side that has ever visited Australia. Douglas took over the captaincy, but from his sick bed Sir Pelham had considerable influence on the strategy of the campaign.', ""He had recovered sufficiently from his illness to begin playing in 1912, and on May 23 he scored 126 for the M.C.C. Australian Touring XI against The Rest of England, at Lord's. The Rest, strongly represented, were defeated by an innings and 10 runs which confirmed the strength of the touring side. "", ""His early good form gained him a place in the England XIs which met Australia and South Africa in the Lord's Tests -- it was the Triangular Tournament season -- but the exertion of his early successes was too much for him, and before the end of June he dropped out of cricket for the rest of the season."", 'He was able to play fairly regularly in 1913, making 987 runs for Middlesex with an average of 41.12. The county would probably have won the County Championship in 1914 if war had not been declared on August 4. He made no big score that season, but ', ' said that he played very well in several matches.', ""During the Great War he served with the Inns of Court, spent some time at the War Office with the rank of Captain attached General Staff and then in 1916 went into the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers for an operation. After six month's sick leave he served with Col. John Buchan in the Department of Information at the Foreign Office. Another six months and he was again very ill and on March 21, 1918, he had to resign his commission on account of his health."", 'When county cricket was resumed in  1919 he was then 45 and found the hours of play, 11.30 to 7.30 on the first day, and 11 to 7.30 on the second, too much for him and, as he put it, by the middle of July he was a dead dog and he seriously thought of resigning the Middlesex captaincy, but A.J. Webbe, for whom he had great admiration, persuaded him to continue, and as events proved 1920 was to be his ', '.', ""At the beginning of the season Middlesex were not rated as very serious contenders for the Championship, and by the end of July were apparently out of the running, but, beginning with the Sussex match at Hove on July 31, they won their last nine matches and the Championship was theirs. Two of the matches were desperately close affairs, Kent being beaten at Canterbury by 5 runs and Yorkshire at Bradford by 4 runs. Surrey were due at Lord's on August 28, 30 and 31, and it was necessary for Middlesex to win to finish as Champions."", ""It was only after a tremendous struggle that Middlesex succeeded by 55 runs. C.H.L. Skeet and H.W. Lee scored hundreds for the winners, and G.T.S. Stevens, then only l9, had a grand match with scores of 53 and 21 not out and five wickets for 61 in Surrey's second innings. "", ""But Sir Pelham himself had a rare triumph. He batted for nearly four and a half hours to make 79, top score in the first innings when matters were going none too well for his county, and in his very last innings for Middlesex at Lord's he was 14 not out when he declared, leaving Surrey to make 244 in three hours and seven minutes. Valuable as his batting was, and especially in this match, it was, to quote "", ' once again his skill as a captain that made his final season memorable.', 'During the whole of his first-class career Sir Pelham scored 29,028 runs with an average of 36.28. He hit sixty centuries and exceeded 1,000 runs in fourteen seasons.', 'His retirement from first-class cricket did not mean the end of his touring. In 1926-27 he led the M.C.C. team which visited South America, playing seven matches in the Argentine, one at Montevideo, one at Valparaiso and one at Lima.', 'The team included Lord Dunglass, later Lord Home and now, as I write, Sir Alec Douglas Home, Prime Minister, and created a tremendous amount of good will. The matches were reported in the South American press, one account saying that the veteran captain was eliminado at slip. As he was fond of saying, there was no disputing that dismissal. A year later he captained  M.C.C. for the last time on an overseas tour, taking a strong side to Holland. It was the jubilee of The Hague club, founded in 1878.', ""In 1932-33 he went to Australia as joint manager with R.C.N. Palairet of the M.C.C. team captained by D.R. Jardine. Bodyline cast a shadow over the tour. He was completely opposed to this type of bowling; indeed he had objected to it as long ago as 1910 when W.B. Burns bowled it for a few overs for Worcestershire against Middlesex at Lord's, but he never allowed his opposition to interfere with his admiration for Jardine as a man and as a leader."", 'History has of course proved that Sir Pelham was right, and in 1937 his outstanding services to cricket, both on and off the field, were recognised by a knighthood.', 'Shortly before the Second World War started he went to Denmark with an M.C.C. team captained by G.C. Newman, but as he was nearly 66 he naturally took no active part in the cricket.', 'It has already been stated that he was honoured with a place on the M.C.C. committee in April 1904. He served on and off for virtually the rest of his life.', 'In 1926 he was appointed Chairman of the Selection committee composed of P. Perrin and A.E.R. Gilligan in addition to himself, and to his great delight England regained the Ashes after their memorable win in the fifth Test at The Oval.', 'He was appointed chairman again in 1931, the two other members of the committee being P. Perrin and T.A. Higson. I suppose it would be difficult to think of three men who were so dissimilar in character yet they worked splendidly together even if Higson occasionally let fly, and they built up the fine team which won 4-1 in Australia in 1932-33.', ""Sir Pelham was also chairman of the Selectors in 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938. The South Africans were here in 1935, and for the first time they succeeded in winning a Test match in England, defeating us at Lord's by 157 runs. Sir Pelham that year again had the assistance of Perrin and Higson, with R.E.S. Wyatt, who was appointed captain, co-opted. "", ""The selection of the England team for the Lord's Test produced the longest Selection Committee meeting of  Sir Pelham's long experience. He, Perrin and Higson wanted to play R.W.V. Robins; Wyatt was emphatic in urging T.B. Mitchell of Derbyshire. After an all-day sitting the Selectors with great reluctance gave way to Wyatt and Mitchell played. In a comparatively low scoring match he bowled 53 overs for 164 runs and took only three wickets. It took Sir Pelham a long time to get over that match -- if he ever did."", 'During the Second World War he was appointed Deputy Secretary of M.C.C. He threw himself heart and soul into his work and before long was arranging splendid matches for a harassed public who responded nobly, eagerly seizing the opportunity of seeing some of their favourites playing once again.', ""He retired from his secretarial duties at Lord's in September, 1945 and two years later he sailed with G.O. Allen's M.C.C. side to the West Indies. I do not think it is any secret that some of the younger members of the team were a little apprehensive about having an elderly gentleman touring with them. But his tact, courtly charm and old world manners soon put everyone at their ease, and when the tour was over the players said how pleased they were to have had him with them."", 'He told me he was fearful that the great honour of being President of M.C.C. might elude him for as he often said ""I\'m a delicate old dog and will not be here much longer."" It is therefore not difficult to picture his delight, and relief, when on May 3, 1950, he was nominated President by H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh.', 'In point of fact His Royal Highness was unable to be present, and Lord Cornwallis, President in 1947, presided in his absence. When he began to make the announcement he got no farther than ""Sir Pel--"" when there was an unprecedented scene, the cheering which followed lasting for several minutes. It was indeed an unforgettable moment.', 'He was 76 years and seven months old when he was nominated, and only one older man has been made President -- Stanley Christopherson who beat Sir Pelham by a year. He had been President of Middlesex from 1937 to 1946.', ""In 1950 he was Chairman of the Committee which selected F.R. Brown's team to tour Australia that winter, and three years later, in November, 1953, the M.C.C. gave a dinner in the Long Room to celebrate his 80th birthday. In 1958 a new grandstand built at Lord's was named after him. There was still one final honour to come to him. In May 1961 he became the first life Vice President of M.C.C."", 'When Lord Hawke took a team to the West Indies in 1897 he was asked by H.V.L. Stanton (Wanderer of ', ') if he could arrange for somebody to send back accounts of the matches to be played by his team. Lord Hawke turned to Sir Pelham and said ""Plummy, you\'re last from school. Why shouldn\'t you do it?"" He did and that began his career as one of the outstanding writers on the game.', 'Sir Pelham in fact provided the account of that tour for the ', ' of 1898 and in 1911 he contributed a short article for the Almanack entitled ', '. His ', ', which appeared in the 1955 ', ', was an extensive survey of the game as well as a critical analysis which contained much advice on problems which still confront us.', 'During his long life he wrote, or edited, the following books: ', ' (1911-12 Tour)', '(With others), ', '(Numerous editions), ', '(Badminton Library, revised edition, 1920, with others),', ' (Morning Post, 1920), ', '(With F.S.

', 'With his first-class career over, he became Editor of ', ' when the magazine was founded in 1921, and retained that position until 1962 when he was succeeded by his son, John Warner. I think it is correct to state that when he was appointed it was thought he would be largely a figurehead, but on the contrary he threw himself wholeheartedly into his duties and maintained his enthusiastic interest in the magazine until his death.', 'In the earlier years he wrote many articles for ', '. Often we would discuss a topic, and I would then rough it out. After that we had a session in which we would endeavour to add polish. It was great fun, and I spent many hours with him on this kind of work.', 'From 1921 to 1932 he wrote regularly for ', '. Early in 1933, under the strain of the Bodyline controversy, he cabled the paper and certainly, but quite unwittingly, gave the Editor, H.A. Gwynne, and the Sports Editor, Tom Hodder, the impression that he did not wish to continue as their Cricket Correspondent. There was little time for ', ' to find another correspondent and they could hardly be blamed for appointing R.C. Robertson-Glasgow -- an excellent choice.', 'Subsequently, Sir Pelham explained that the cable had been misinterpreted, but by then it was too late as ', ' had committed themselves with Mr. Robertson-Glasgow. Happily the matter ended with Mr. Gwynne and Sir Pelham still the best of friends.', 'As a result of this unfortunate misunderstanding Sir Pelham was invited to write for ', ', and after all these years it may not be out of place to state that he was rather less happy with ', ' than ', '.', 'Possibly they did not quite understand his approach to the game he loved so dearly. For example, when he wrote about Bowes they altered his copy to the bespectacled Bowes, and when Bradman was mobbed by girls at Worcester he received a wire. ""Send 500 words Bradman and the girls."" It would be difficult to imagine anyone less suited to write a story of that nature. He thought the whole thing was a joke, put the wire in his pocket, and took no action.', 'As my boyhood was spent in Sussex I saw very little of Sir Pelham as an active player, and my only real recollection is of seeing him lead Middlesex on to the field at Hove, wearing of course a Harlequin cap which he renewed every two years.', 'As the years passed I got to know him most intimately and to my dying day I shall treasure memories of his great encouragement and countless kindnesses to me. His one fault was that he was for too generous with his praise. Thirty years ago the use of Christian and nicknames was not nearly so common as it is today and therefore I shall always remember with pride the day when he said ""Why don\'t you call me by my cognomen?""', 'Until the outbreak of war he visited ', "" office virtually every morning. His visits did on occasion interfere with work as he delighted in discussing the previous day's play, and if he had been to a show overnight he was quite capable of giving more or less word for word what Harry Lauder, for example, had said at the Palladium -- Scottish accent and all. "", 'He was, too, very fond of Western films and I can hear him saying, with a twinkle in his eyes, ""Stick \'em up, Baby."" He was no mean mimic, and he was especially good at imitating Lord Harris, who had a habit of stroking his cheek when a difficult point was being discussed in committee ""We--ll,  Warner, there may be something in what you say.""', ""He loved animals, and on one occasion he thought he was paying our then secretary a great compliment when he told her she had eyes just like his spaniel's. She was not amused."", ""It is, I know, only stating the obvious to say that cricket predominated in Sir Pelham's thoughts, but he was a great patriot, believing passionately in the British way of life and had made a study of Naval and Military history. He delighted in listening to Service debates at Westminster, and one of the happiest experiences of his life was when Admiral Jellicoe asked him to take passage with him in H.M.S. New Zealand to Egypt at the beginning of 1919."", 'But, of course, cricket always came first, and I think this story told to me by Lady Warner was typical of his devotion to the game. Some years ago they, with some friends, were admiring the beauties of a charming little French church. Suddenly, Sir Pelham left the party by the altar and strode off down the aisle towards the West door with a rather grim expression on his face. When he rejoined the party Lady Warner said to him ""Whatever is the matter, Pelham?"" (She never called him Plum.) ""Oh, nothing, it is just as I thought, the length of a cricket pitch.""', 'He had a great admiration for youth, and he was a remarkably fine judge of a young player, which reminds me of an argument he had with his old friend, the one and only Gerry Weigell, at the Folkestone Festival many years ago. ', ""Weigall contended, perhaps with a good deal of reason, that Middlesex were unduly favoured by having the pick of young players at Lord's without any expense to themselves, while Kent had to pay wages to any young cricketer while he was qualifying. To bring home his points Weigall would take off the inevitable straw hat and bang it with his fist before putting it on again. This happened many times as the argument developed to the delight of the rest of us at the tea table. "", 'At the end of it all Sir Pelham said, almost with tears in his eyes, ""I can see, my dear Gerry, that you don\'t want Middlesex to have any young players at all.""', 'And now a recollection of one of the most entertaining two hours I have ever had in my life. I was at Sir Pelham\'s flat and just as I was leaving he said ""Don\'t go, Charlo (C.B. Fry) is coming."" ', 'Well, Fry arrived and for the next two hours I was spellbound. He never ceased talking, he took off his jacket, he played imaginary strokes, he danced about the room, in fact he did everything. Every now and again Sir Pelham tried to get a word in, but every time he did Fry held up his hand in an imperious manner and said ""Plum, be quiet"" and off he went again. It was all highly entertaining. ', 'The following morning when Sir Pelham came to ', ' office he said in a most doleful manner ""Do you know Charlo spoke for forty-five minutes last night before he would let me get a word in,"" which when one comes to think of it was no mean feat as Sir Pelham was a great talker himself.', 'On June 7, 1904, he married Agnes Blyth, by whom he had two sons and a daughter, at the Parish Church of St. Marylebone. Lord Hawke was best man, and Field Marshal Lord Roberts signed the register. (Subsequently he was an enthusiastic supporter of Lord Roberts\' campaign for National Service.) Many years later as a result of frequent visits to the Warner home I got to know Lady Warner extremely well -- and the better I knew her the more I admired her. For the last ten years of her life she was a chronic invalid, being confined to her bed for long periods at a time, but never once did I hear her grumble, and she maintained the keenest possible interest in the events of the day. She was a remarkably brave and patient woman, and I can see her now lying in bed and watching the television, preferably a sporting event. She was a fine judge of cricket, and did not W. H. Patterson once say, ""If you cannot have Warner on the Selection Committee you should ask his wife.""', 'She was present at the famous Eton and Harrow match of 1910 -- Fowler\'s match -- and with Eton apparently well beaten she turned to a friend and said, ""I shall not send my boy to Eton as they cannot play cricket,"" and then left Lord\'s for her home in Kent as the end seemed so near. When she reached Caring she found a telegram awaiting her: ""Better send him Eton won by nine runs."" On another occasion she told me how she used to amuse Sir Pelham when he was recovering from his serious illness in Australia by picking up odd ', ' and asking him what he had scored in a particular match. Almost invariably he answered correctly.', ""On Friday March 8, 1963, his ashes were scattered at Lord's near the Warner stand close to the spot where he had hit his first four for Rugby v Marlborough in 1889. It was my very great privilege to be present on a most impressive occasion. The wind blew hard during the ceremony, but the sun was shining. Directly we returned to the pavilion it poured with rain. I couldn't help thinking dear old Plum had been favoured to the very end.\n""]","['Knighted for services to cricket 1937', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1904, 1921']",15.0,28,2,622.0,132*,23.92,,,1,3,,0,3,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,521.0,875,75,29028,244,36.28,,,60,149,,,183,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,521.0,,1132,636,15,2/26,,42.40,3.37,75.4,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Though he usually bowled in the orthodox tradition, as preferred by Yorkshire, he sometimes bowled wrist-spinners (with a bemusing googly - the `chinaman'), especially when on overseas duty for England. It was his misfortune that his career coincided with that of the more aggressive Tony Lock of Surrey, who was preferred to him for many Tests during the 1950s. \n"", 'Still, Wardle played 28 times for England and took 102 wickets at only 20.39, five times taking five wickets in an innings. His best figures were 7 for 36 (12 for 89 in the match) at Cape Town during the tied 1956-57 series in South Africa, when he took 26 wickets in four Tests at a mere 13.81, missing the last Test through a cartilage operation. On the tour he took 90 wickets at a dozen runs apiece, and caused Jim Laker to remark some years later that Wardle had produced the best displays of spin bowling he had ever seen.', ""Yet he played in only one further Test, at Lord's (where he played seven times), in 1957, against West Indies. A year later he was sacked by Yorkshire, wrote some scathing article for the "", ', and had his invitation to tour Australia withdrawn by MCC. He went in 1958-59 as a journalist instead. That angry episode was the first indication to the public at large that there was more to Wardle than the expert bowler and rib-tickling clown who enjoyed outrageous charades and ball-tricks on the field. He could be acidly critical and, according to some of his Yorkshire colleagues, occasionally selfish, characteristics which might be excused of high-class performers in some fields of entertainment, but not cricket. It was a shattering conclusion to a wonderful career.', 'Born in Ardsley, near Barnsley, on January 8, 1923, Wardle began his working life as a colliery fitter, working from 6 am to 2.30 pm so that he had plenty of time for cricket. Yorkshire signed him from league cricket just after the war, and within a short period he was touring West Indies with MCC, playing in the Trinidad Test, but being given only three overs by Gubby Allen in an innings which reached 497. His reputation with Yorkshire was soon soundly established, with 148 wickets in 1948 and 100 or more in each of the following nine seasons, with 172 in 1950 his best. But his Test calls were few, with a wide range of English spinners in contention. At the top level he did at least show his steadiness, as with figures of 49-21-77-1 against South Africa at Trent Bridge in 1951. He played in three of the Tests against Australia in 1953, toying with the opposition in the closing stages at Old Trafford, taking 4 for 7 as the tourists slipped to 35 for 8. His two Tests that winter in the Caribbean brought scant success, though his 66 in the final Test was of vast importance in setting up a series-saving victory. Here Wardle helped his captain, Len Hutton (205), put on 105 for the seventh wicket.', 'In the Oval Test of 1954, when England let her guard slip against Pakistan, Wardle at least, and almost alone, came away with honour intact, having taken 7 to 56 in the second innings. He got in a lot of practice with his wrist-spinners on the deck of ', "" on the way to Australia in the autumn of 1954, and earned his keep with 57 tour wickets at 20.45 during a tour when England depended heavily on pace. He teased and bamboozled the Australians with 5 for 79 and 3 for 51 in the inconclusive final Test at Sydney- to echoes of `Coom on, ye broad acres' from British sailors on the Hill- but the series had already been won. That victory owed something to Wardle, however, for his vigorous 35 at Sydney in the Second Test, when he added a crucial 43 with Statham for the 10th wicket."", ""The next time he faced the Australians, in the Lord's Test of 1956, he bagged a pair. But that winter he went off to his triumphs in South Africa, where he carved his name resoundingly into Test annals at last. He had been part of an England side which never lost a series from 1951 until 1958-59. Wardle's presence on that Australian tour, when England went down four-nil, may well have made a critical difference."", ""He took 1537 wickets for Yorkshire at 17.67, placing himself eighth in the county's honour roll. Of all his many wonderful returns, the 9 for 25 he took on a rain-affected pitch in the Roses match at Old Trafford in 1954 was the best statistically. Earlier that season he had taken 9 for 48 (with catches missed) against Sussex at Hull, finishing with 16 for 112 in the match. Many a batsman must have had nightmares before going out to face Wardle, Trueman, Appleyard and Co."", ""After the breach with Yorkshire, Johnny Wardle played for Nelson and Rishton and Minor County cricket for Cambridgeshire. The old rift was healed when he was made an honorary life member of Yorkshire, and became bowling adviser. But for the volcanic eruption of 1958, though, his graceful action, square shoulders, fair hair and gravelly voice-might have been part of the first-class scene for years to come. `Johnny the Joker' comes through in his autobiography, "", ', published in 1957.

In the 1930s there was no finer sight among batsmen; and his home ground was the aptly beautiful greensward of Worcester. \n"", ""He was Welsh-born, in Bedlinog, on Aug 28, 1905, and attracted early attention as a schoolboy at cricket around Neath and as a Swansea rugby player. His first-class debut for Glamorgan came in 1923, when he was only 17, but progress was slow. By 1928 he was averaging no more than 17, with two hundreds to his credit, and the announcement of his early retirement for `business reasons' was read with sadness."", ""Immediately, however, he reappeared at Worcester as club secretary and amateur batsman, adopting a more natural style, and aspiring to the captaincy in 1931. That winter he toured Jamaica with Tennyson's side, and by 1933 he was ready for Test cricket."", ""It was a fruitful summer for Walters, and turned out to be the best of all for him, with nine centuries among his 2404 runs at 50.08, his career-highest score of 226 against Kent at Gravesend, and selection as opener in all three Tests against West Indies. His 51 at Lord's helped set England up for an eventual innings victory; 46 at Old Trafford was followed by 2 at The Oval. Those golden months earned him selection as one of "", ""'s Cricketers of the Year."", ""At the end of the season he went with Jardine's side to India, enchanting the crowds with his graceful strokeplay and finishing second to his captain in the overall averages. At Bombay's Gymkhana Ground he scored 78 and 14 not out as England won the opening Test; at Eden Gardens, Calcutta, again opening with Yorkshire's Arthur Mitchell, he made 29 and 2 not out in a drawn match; and in the final Test, at Madras, he crowned his tour with 59 and 102, opening with Bakewell and contributing much towards an England victory sealed by the spin of Verity and Langridge."", ""It was no surprise when he was chosen to play for England against Australia as the 1934 rubber began, but a little unexpected that he should find himself as captain in this maiden Ashes Test, R. E. S. Wyatt having sustained a broken thumb. Walters scored 17 and 46 in a losing cause, but held his place for Lord's, when Wyatt resumed the captaincy. Again starting England's innings with Sutcliffe, the slender Walters made a handsome 82 (some film of which survives) before O'Reilly's googly forced a catch at leg. Verity- and rain - cured an innings victory for England their last against Australia at Lord's to date) after centuries by Leyland and Ames."", '  ', "" Walters continued to make it a memorable series by stroking 52 and 50 not out in the drawn Manchester Test and 44 and 45 at Leeds. A 64 followed at The Oval, where England were crushed by 562 runs in the Ashes decider, Ponsford and Bradman putting on 451 for Australia's second wicket. Walters was bowled by McCabe for 1 in England's anti-climactic final innings, to finish with 401 runs at 50.13, this against two of the most testing bowlers of all time, Grimmett and O'Reilly. It also happened to mark the end of Walters' Test career. In his 11 matches for England he had cut and driven and glided 784 runs at a highly creditable 52.27, 12 of his 18 innings passing 40.

As he reflected on the 1933-34 Indian tour, he recalled that Jardine, during the tour, `seemed always to have a large book tucked under his arm'. He recalled how his captain had walked into a reception in which an uncle was lined up with the Indian officials: `He had the same huge nose as Douglas. Douglas just walked straight past him.'"", "" Cyril Walters had great respect for Indian fast bowler Amar Singh, to whom he mainly played back: ` Douglas lunged forward and got out second ball, saying afterwards that he was sick of watching me play back all the time.'

June 8, 1945, Bromley, Kent ",,73 years 289 days,"['England,', 'Kent']",,,,Bowler,Right-hand bat,Slow left-arm orthodox,,,,"['\nNo nickname was better earned that the ""Deadly"" which Derek Underwood\'s Kent team-mates conferred on him for the havoc he caused on rain-affected pitches. Such was his accuracy and, for a left-arm spinner, pace - either side of medium when the ball was really biting - that when conditions favoured him an avalanche of wickets was almost guaranteed. His wizardry brought England one of the most dramatic wins in the history of Tests when, with six minutes left against Australia at The Oval in 1968, he took his fourth wicket in 27 balls. That clinched a 226-run win which squared the series, even though a lunchtime cloudburst which flooded the ground had swallowed all but 75 minutes of the last four hours. In similar circumstances at Hastings in 1973, Underwood demolished Sussex by taking 8 for 9 after a bare-footed Kent team helped the Fire Brigade mop up another flooded ground. Underwood\'s accuracy, intelligence and patience meant he was always a blessing to his captains. He adapted to conditions overseas, especially in Australia, by dropping his pace, and might have added 50-100 wickets to his England haul of 297 but for joining World Series Cricket in 1977, then the disapproved tour of South Africa in 1981-82. A game nightwatchman and a workmanlike outfielder, he was as unaffectedly pleasant at the end of his career as when, in 1963, he became the youngest bowler to take 100 wickets in his initial season. In 2008, he was unveiled as the new President of MCC on a one-year term. ', ' \n', '\nDerek Leslie Underwood was born in Bromley, Kent on June 8 1945. A left arm\nslow bowler he made his debut for Kent at age 17 and became the youngest\nplayer in history to take 100 first-class wickets in his first season. He\nachieved this feat on 9 further occasions in a county career spanning 25\nyears, and in 1966 took a remarkable 157 wickets. He was chosen for England\nagainst the West Indies, when just 21 years old and went on to play 86 tests, despite\ninterrupting his international career to play world series cricket and\nterminating it with a disapproved  trip to South Africa. His 297 Test\nwickets are included in a career total of 2465 taken at just 20 runs apiece.\nHe was awarded the MBE in 1981.', 'To describe Derek Underwood as a slow bowler, or simply a spinner is to give\na false picture of a unique performer. Much of his bowling was delivered at\na respectable medium pace, and  always off a plodding run-up of ten yards or\nso. When conditions were right he would turn the ball extravagantly, but on\ngood  pitches, against good players, he would still take plentiful wickets\nthrough his unfailing accuracy. Batsmen, infuriated or entranced by the\nunhittable length and line firing at them with the remorseless regularity of\na  bowling machine, would very often commit cricketing suicide in their\nfrustration.', 'Underwood was at his most effective on the uncovered English pitches  of\nthe sixties and early seventies. On a ""sticky dog"" the cricket slang for a\npich affected by rain he could be unplayable. Full covering failed to thwart\nhim, however, and both in county and Test cricket he maintained a high\nsuccess rate through his dedicated attention to detail. A bad delivery from\nUnderwood was a rarity and the anguish over it would be etched on his\nexpression. Although sometimes accused of bowling, a negative, flat\ntrajectory, when conditions demanded something  more flighted, Underwood\nwas a master of variations of pace and slight shifts in angle. He won\ncountless lbw victims with the ball which swung in to the right hander,\n""with the arm"".', ""Underwood's most memorable triumph of many in his long  career, was to\nretrieve the series against Australia. It had seemed hopelessly lost. The\ncircumstances of the story are extraordinary and the fact that they could\nnot be repeated now makes it a tale worth retelling."", 'It was 1968 and England captained by Colin Cowdrey had lost the first  test\nto Bill Lawry\'s Australians and then drawn the next three. Underwood, who\ndid not play in the defeat, bowled creditably in each succeeding game, but\nhis hour of glory arrived literally at the last gasp. The final Test, played\nas tradition demands at the Oval, had been dictated by England. They had\ngained a first innings lead of 170 and, although England were dismissed the\nsecond time around for 181, Australia looked doomed when they went into\nlunch on the fifth day at 86 for 5.

October 21, 1851, Crabtree, Pitsmoor, Sheffield, Yorkshire ","June 18, 1898, Pitsmoor, Sheffield, Yorkshire (aged 46 years 240 days) ",,"['England,', 'Yorkshire']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm fast (roundarm),,,,"['\n', ""\nGeorge Ulyett died on Saturday evening, June 18th. He was only in his forty-seventh year, his last season in the Yorkshire eleven being 1893. His health had been failing for some time, but the immediate cause of death was an acute attack of pneumonia, contracted at Bramall Lane during the Yorkshire and Kent match. Yorkshire has always been rich in first-rate cricketers, but a finer player than Ulyett the county has never produced. He was for years the best bat in the team, and even if he had not been able to get a run he would have been worth his place for his bowling and fielding. His career for the county extended over a period of twenty years, his first appearance in the eleven dating back to July, 1873. It was seen at once that a player of remarkable gifts had been discovered, and before very long he was at the top of the tree. To begin with, if one remembers rightly, he was played as much for his fast bowling as for his batting. One talent, however, developed to a much greater extent than the other, and in two or three seasons he was quite as good a bat as Ephraim Lockwood, who, when Ulyett came out, was the bright particular star of the Yorkshire eleven. Once having established his position Ulyett never looked back. There was no doubt his class as a batsman after his first visit to Australia with James Lillywhite's team in the winter of  1876-77, and from that time till 1891 he was always in the front rank. Of course, like other great batsmen, he did much better in some seasons than others, but he never lost his place as a representative cricketer. A peculiar interest attaches to the tour of James Lillywhite's team - not, in some respects, very brilliant - as it was then that the Australians first ventured to play an English eleven on even terms. Thanks to a wonderful innings of 165 by  Charles Bannerman, Australia won the first match, but in the return the Englishmen had their revenge, Ulyett's batting deciding the fortunes of the game. It was the fine play they showed that season that led the Australians to pay their first visit to England, a momentous chapter in the history of modern cricket being thus opened. \n"", ""At home Ulyett of course played many times for England against Australia, and in two memorable encounters at Lord's he contributed in a very marked degree to England's success. The first of the two matches was in 1884, when A. G. Steel scored 148 - the innings of his life. On the Tuesday afternoon the Australians, with a balance of 150 runs against them, went in for the second time. The wicket had not worn well, and Peate, bowling from the Nursery end, had the batsmen from the first in obvious difficulties. After a little time, however, to everyone's surprise, Lord Harris took him off and gave Ulyett the ball. Never was a captain better justified by results. The broken places on the pitch which had made Peate difficult rendered Ulyett well-nigh irresistible. Bowling his fastest, and repeatedly breaking back several inches, he had one of the strongest of all Australian teams at his mercy. At the drawing of stumps that evening four men were out for 73, and the next morning the Australians were all out for 143, England winning the match by an innings and five runs. Ulyett took seven wickets in 39 overs and a ball, and had only 36 runs hit from him. It was on that eventful Tuesday afternoon that  Ulyett caught and bowled Bonnor in a way that no one who was present will ever forget. Bonnor's mission was to  knock the fast bowler off, and he did his best. He drove a  half-volley with all his force, but the ball - travelling faster than an express train - went into Ulyett's right hand instead of to the boundary. Bonnor wandered disconsolately back to the Pavilion, and the England players gathered round Ulyett, curious, perhaps, to know what manner of man he was, and anxious to congratulate him on his escape from imminent danger. One can remember, even now, the look of wonder on the faces of A. G. Steel and  Alfred Lyttelton. Ulyett himself was very modest about the matter. Complimented on the catch, when the day's play was over, he said simply that if the ball had hit his fingers instead of going into his hand he should have played no more cricket that season."", 'The other England match was in 1890. England had much the stronger side, and won in the end by seven wickets, but on the first day there was a period of great anxiety. The ground had suffered a good deal from rain, and after the Australians had been put out for 132, England lost W. G. Grace, Shrewsbury, W. W. Read and Gunn - the four best bats on the side - for 20 runs.  Turner and Ferris were bowling their best, and the outlook was, to say the least, cheerless. However, Maurice Read and Ulyett saved the side from collapse. They put on 72 runs in an hour and a half, and next morning Ulyett carried his own score to 74. That was the highest innings he ever played for England against Australia in this country, and, curiously enough, he never appeared for England again. The  Yorkshire authorities would not let him off for The Oval match in 1890, and when the Australians paid us their next visit, in 1893, his star had waned.', ""Of Ulyett's doings for Yorkshire and in the Gentlemen and in the  Gentlemen and Players matches a column could easily be written. He was at his very best for this county in the season of 1887, when he and Louis Hall did great things. The one brilliancy itself, the other a miracle of patience, they were an ideal pair to start an innings. It is a moot  point whether bowlers were the more disturbed by Ulyett's hitting or by Hall's unwearying defence. Some preferred to bowl at Ulyett because he hit at so many balls that there was always a chance of getting him out. Alfred Shaw for one never despaired of seeing him caught if the ground was large enough to allow of the outfields being placed very deep. To say that Ulyett was the greatest batsman Yorkshire ever possessed would scarcely be exceeding the truth, but  Lockwood in the past and F. S. Jackson in the present must in fairness be classed with him.\n""]",[],25.0,39,0,949.0,149,24.33,,,1,7,,5,19,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,537.0,928,40,20823,199*,23.44,,,18,101,,,368,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25.0,35,2627,1020,50.0,7/36,7/57,20.4,2.32,52.5,2,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,537.0,,31136,13157,653,7/30,,20.14,2.53,47.6,,23,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

August 8, 1909, Annesley Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire ","June 6, 1984, Lenton, Nottinghamshire (aged 74 years 303 days) ",,"['England,', 'Nottinghamshire']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Left-arm fast-medium,,,,"[""\nBill Voce, who died at Nottingham on June 6, 1984, aged 74, is largely thought of in these days as the junior in one of the great bowling partnerships,  Larwood and  Voce, and for the contribution that he made to the  bodyline attack in  Australia in 1932-33. Although he was somewhat slower than  Larwood, his line, from left-arm over the  wicket, and the steeper bounce that he obtained from his height, made him formidable enough and the batsmen got no relief when facing him. His job in that 1932-33 series was to maintain the pressure and he did it nobly, taking, besides, fifteen wickets in four matches: he missed the  fourth Test owing to injury. The controversy which this tour excited and the amount that has been written since has diverted attention from his performances in the first two Tests in  1936-37. No English side in this century had had such a bad press before the tour started: it was popularly regarded as having no chance whatever. Its captain,  G. O. Allen, the third fast bowler on the previous trip, had been irredeemably opposed to bodyline and had refused to bowl it: it is worth recording that he himself had by orthodox methods taken eight for 131 in the  third Test. So before the selection of the team was completed the Chairman arranged a meeting between  Allen and  Voce at which  Allen insisted on an undertaking being given that bodyline tactics would not be employed.  Voce demurred at first, but finally agreed to fall in with his captain's wishes and throughout the tour bowled over the wicket to an  off-side field. In the  first Test he took six for 41 and four for 16:  Australia lost by 322 runs and the critics were confounded. The second was even more sensational.  Allen declared (a step almost unprecedented in a timeless Test) at 426 for six in order to get  Australia in on a wet wicket, and with the seventh ball of the first over  Voce had  O'Brien, a left-hander,  caught at  slip: from the next ball  Bradman was  caught at  short-leg. A maiden followed and off the second ball of his next over  McCabe was  caught.  Australia were three wickets down for 1 run and  Voce had taken them all in four balls. The side was out for 80 and, though they got 324 in their  second innings, they lost by an innings,  Voce's figures being four for 10 and three for 66. In addition  Chipperfield had been missed off his bowling in the  first innings. In this match the weather had helped  England, in the next it helped  Australia, who won by 365 runs.  Voce was in no way to blame: though his five wickets cost him 169 runs, he maintained, according to "", ', his concentration and deadliness right throughout both innings. \n', ""Unfortunately, at this stage of the tour  Voce's back gave out.  Allen was strongly opposed to playing him in the  fourth Test. He reckoned that no fast bowler can give of his best unless he is completely sound, and he hoped by resting  Voce to have him fit to win the  fifth Test. However, he was overruled by his selection committee.  England again lost:  Voce took one  wicket only which cost him 135 runs. Nor was he up to form in the last Test when  Australia, scoring 604, won by an  innings. He took three for 123, giving him a record for the series of 26 wickets at 21.53. During this tour a close and life-long friendship had arisen between  Voce and his captain. Years later he told  Allen that he now reckoned that bodyline had been wrong, but that, from loyalty to his old friend  Larwood, he was not prepared to say anything on the subject to the press. This sidelight on his character helps to explain why he was so widely respected when, after his playing days were over, he coached first at Trent Bridge and later for many years for MCC at Lord's and elsewhere."", ""After starting work in a colliery when fourteen,  Voce was noticed in local cricket by  Fred Barratt, the  Nottinghamshire fast bowler, and engaged on the county staff in 1926. Success in the Second XI brought him a trial for  Nottinghamshire in June  1927, against  Gloucestershire at  Trent Bridge. He seized it by taking five for 36 and followed this a few weeks later with six for 39 against  Essex. Strong though the county's bowling was, he kept his place for the rest of the season and finished with 37 wickets at 27.18. At this time he was an orthodox slow left-armer, though in the later matches he sometimes lowered his arm slightly and bowled swingers. In  1928 he definitely settled to bowl fast-medium and many felt that  England had lost a great slow left-armer. That may well be true, but it is certain that they had gained a great fast one. After heading the  Nottinghamshire averages in 1929 and having a big part in winning them the Championship, he went that winter with  MCC to the  West Indies and played with considerable success in what were then called Representative matches and have since been canonised as Tests. There was, in fact, simultaneously an  MCC side playing Tests in  New Zealand and the two teams between them contained only five men who played in the Tests against  Australia in  1930. On this tour  Voce bowled mainly fast, but his chief success was in  Trinidad where, moderating his pace to medium on the matting, he took twelve for 110 against the island and eleven for 119 in the Test. In the Tests in  South Africa in the next winter, he took 23 wickets, more than any other bowler on either side, and, after representing  England at home against  New Zealand in  1931 and  India in  1932, he was picked for  Jardine's Australian tour. Despite their success there, neither he nor  Larwood was selected to play against  Australia in  England in  1934 and, as  Jardine himself had refused to be considered, there was much the same indignation in many quarters as in 1984: it was felt that owing to diplomatic considerations  England were fielding something considerably less than their best team. Criticism increased when at  Trent Bridge in August  Voce took eight for 66 against the tourists and was accused of bouncing the ball at them unnecessarily."", 'Before the 1935 season started both he and  Larwood asked  MCC not to pick them for any of the Tests. However, midway through 1936  Voce again made himself available if wanted, and, picked for the  third Test against  India, bowled well without any luck at all: it was this performance that made him a certainty for the side to  Australia that winter. With that tour, through no fault of his own, his best days ended. In 1937, after playing in the  first Test against  New Zealand, he damaged a knee and had to have a cartilage removed, which finished his cricket for the season. In 1938 he was much troubled by synovitis and his wickets were expensive, and he thus shares with  J. N. Crawford and  D. R. Jardine the distinction of being a great  England cricketer who never appeared against  Australia in a Test in  England. In 1939 he was given a benefit, and modern readers may be surprised to hear that this produced only £980. In 1946 he was 37 and it could hardly be expected that, after six seasons away from serious cricket, he would be the bowler he had been, especially as he was still in the forces and not regularly available. None the less, four for 7 in a Test trial won him a place in the  second Test against  India and also in the side for  Australia in the autumn. The selection was a mistake: the beautiful action remained, the venom had gone, and he now bowled in those whom once he would have bowled out. Moreover his knee still troubled him, and in June 1947 he resigned from the county side. However, appointed their coach, he continued to play occasionally in a crisis till 1952.', ""In his earlier days as a fast bowler he bowled round the wicket. On his first tour of  Australia he used to bowl round for five or six overs while the shine lasted and then switch to bodyline, bowled over the wicket. To left-handers he used a normal field, but bowled a generous allowance of bouncers. On  Allen's tour he bowled almost entirely over the wicket. In  England after his Australian tours he bowled over or round according to circumstances. But his cricket by no means ended with his bowling. A tall, very strong man, he could hit immensely hard and soon became a dangerous batsman who made four hundreds in first-class cricket and in  1933 scored over 1,000 runs. Against  Glamorgan at  Trent Bridge in  1931 he made 129 in 75 minutes, having reached his 100 in 45 minutes. He was also a splendid fielder and a fine thrower with a very loose arm. In all first-class matches he scored 7,583 runs with an average of 19.19 and took 1,558 wickets at 23.08 a piece. In 27 Tests his figures were 98 wickets at 27.88.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1933'],27.0,38,15,308.0,66,13.39,,,0,1,,8,15,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,426.0,525,130,7590,129,19.21,,,4,26,,,288,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27.0,51,6360,2733,98.0,7/70,11/149,27.88,2.57,64.8,7,3,2,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,426.0,,85500,35961,1558,8/30,,23.08,2.52,54.8,,84,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Sadly, appearances - initially at least - proved misleading. In seven Tests, against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, he averaged 19.27 without a half-century and was repeatedly fallible on the drive outside off stump. Only one Championship hundred for Hampshire added to his mournful air. Vince did manage an ODI half-century against Sri Lanka and showed more promise in T20Is, but those who had lobbied long and hard for his inclusion were particularly disappointed with the outcome of his first international summer as his undoubted style was not matched by substance. Even then they insisted that statistics showed that his ill luck was that he tended to play and edge rather than play and miss. \n', ""But Vince was not to be denied so easily - or at least Vince's advocates weren't. He only averaged 33 in the Championship in 2017, but still found himself on the plane to Australia after England's selectors observed the failure of Tom Westley, and others, to make the No 3 position their own and turned to Vince once again. Simmering talent or habitual maker of soft 20s and 30s? It seemed that England were about to find out."", ""He began with an impressive 83 in Brisbane before he was run out, but only passed 50 once in his next eight innings. Despite 76 in Christchurch in a drawn Test in New Zealand, he was axed again in the English summer even though England were struggling for top-order options. England's new national selector, Ed Smith, seemed to want proof of desire at Hampshire. He responded with 201 from 437 balls against Somerset at Taunton but was overlooked all the same, he topped Hampshire's averages, and his 50-over cricket included a sublime 171 against Yorkshire but his defiance waned and he ended the season feebly with no score above 30 in his last nine innings."", ""A Wiltshire boy who found his way into the Hampshire set up, he was first tipped as a star of the future when the former England coach Duncan Fletcher, who worked with Vince at the Hampshire academy, said he was reminiscent of Michael Vaughan. Like Vaughan, an adherence to sound technique does little to temper his attacking instincts. To attract England's interest more regularly, though, he needed to answer a perception that he suffers a greater proportion of soft dismissals than a player of his ability should."", 'Vince has enjoyed one-day success with Hampshire, his red ball cricket has slowly advanced and he has been a regular in the England Lions squad, impressing with his methodical approach.', ""After he broke into the Hampshire side in 2009 he averaged over 50 in his first round of limited-overs matches before impressing again for England at the Under-19 World Cup. He became a First XI regular in 2010, and in August of that year confirmed his pedigree with an innings of 180 against a Yorkshire attack that included Ajmal Shahzad, Tim Bresnan and Adil Rashid at Scarborough. In that innings he added 278 with Jimmy Adams, breaking Hampshire's fourth-wicket record which had stood since 1970. "", ""Vince went past 1000 career runs for Hampshire while still a teenager - the second youngest player in the county's history behind Phil Mead to do so. In 2012 he averaged 55.50 as Hampshire won the Clydesdale Bank 40, the second part of a one-day double. 2013 saw great improvement in the County Championship and he passed 1000 first-class runs in a season for the first time. That winter he toured Sri Lanka with England Lions and during the following close season in 2014-15, was picked for the Lions trip to South Africa."", 'Vince enjoyed a stand-out season in 2014 after being named Hampshire vice-captain. He made a mighty 1525 runs - the highest tally in the country - at 61.00 as Hampshire won Division Two of the County Championship and also made a superb 93 from just 51 balls to steer his side to victory in a T20 quarter-final at Notts. ', 'His career progressed substantially in 2015 when he made his England one-day debut against Ireland in May and was named as captain of the Lions T20 squad to face Pakistan A in Dubai in December. He also assumed the Hampshire captaincy in all formats at only 24, hailed by his chairman Rod Bransgrove as ""a genuinely gifted and creative captain with a maturity beyond his years.""', 'Ahead of the 2015 season it was announced that Vince would become captain for both limited-overs formats, assuming the 50-over captaincy from Jimmy Adams. By the end of the summer, he had replaced Adams in all three formats only for his career to falter when England came calling.']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2009'],13.0,22,0,548.0,83,24.9,1100,49.81,0,3,86,0,8,0,6.0,5,0,131.0,51,26.2,150,87.33,0,1,17,0,4.0,0.0,7.0,7,0,194.0,46,27.71,165,117.57,0,0,20,5,0.0,0.0,155.0,258,19,9188,240,38.44,14930,61.54,23,35,1387,36,133,0,122.0,114,7,4205,178,39.29,4336,96.97,8,20,493,29,45.0,0.0,173.0,167,16,4483,107*,29.68,3364,133.26,1,28,513,117,84.0,0.0,13.0,4,24,13,0.0,-,-,35.33,3.25,-,0,0,0,6.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,7.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,155.0,59,1633,1014,22,5/41,6/56,46.09,3.72,74.2,0,1,0,122.0,6,132,124,2,1/18,1/18,62.00,5.63,66.0,0,0,0,173.0,6,72,81,3,1/5,1/5,27.00,6.75,24.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He had been reported wounded and missing, and the news of his death came on September 1, exactly four years after he had played his last match for Yorkshire and, at Hove, taken seven Sussex wickets for nine runs in one innings, which finished county cricket before the war. \n', 'He received his wounds in the Eighth Army\'s first attack on the German positions at Catania, in Sicily. Eye-witnesses, who were a few yards from Verity when he was hit, have told the story. The objective was a ridge with strong points and pillboxes. Behind a creeping barrage Verity led his company forward 700 yards. When the barrage ceased, they went on another 300 yards and neared the ridge, in darkness. As the men advanced, through corn two feet high, tracer-bullets swept into them. Then they wriggled through the corn, Verity encouraging them with ""Keep going, keep going."" The moon was at their back, and the enemy used mortar-fire, Very lights and fire-bombs, setting the corn alight. The strongest point appeared to be a farm-house, to the left of the ridge; so Verity sent one platoon round to take the farm-house, while the other gave covering fire. The enemy fire increased, and, as they crept forward, Verity was hit in the chest. ""Keep going,"" he said, ""and get them out of that farm-house."" When it was decided to withdraw, they last saw Verity lying on the ground, in front of the burning corn, his head supported by his batman. So, in the last grim game, Verity showed, as he was so sure to do, that rare courage which both calculates and inspires.', 'Judged by any standard, Verity was a great bowler. Merely to watch him was to know that. The balance of the run up, the high ease of the left-handed action, the scrupulous length, the pensive variety, all proclaimed the master. He combined nature with art to a degree not equalled by any other English bowler of our time. He received a handsome legacy of skill and, by an application that verged on scientific research, turned it into a fortune. There have been bowlers who have reached greatness without knowing, or, perhaps, caring to know just how or why; but Verity could analyse his own intentions without losing the joy of surprise and describe their effect without losing the company of a listener. He was the ever-learning professor, justly proud yet utterly humble.', ""In the matter of plain arithmetic, so often torn from its context to the confusion of judgement, Verity, by taking 1,956 wickets at 14.87 runs each in ten years of first-class cricket, showed by far the best average of his time. In the recorded history of cricket the only bowlers of this class with lower averages are: Alfred Shaw, 2,072 wickets at 11.97 each; Tom Emmett, 1,595 wickets at 13.43 each; George Lohmann, 1,841 wickets at 13.73 each; James Southerton, 1,744 wickets at 14.30 each. It might be argued that during the period 1854 to 1898, covered by the careers of these cricketers, pitches tended to give more help to the bowler than they did during Verity's time. Verity, I know, for one, would not have pressed such a claim in his own favour. He never dwelt on decimals; and, while he enjoyed personal triumph as much as the next man, that which absorbed his deepest interest was the proper issue of a Test match with Australia or of an up-and-down bout with Lancashire; and if, in his country's or county's struggle towards victory, he brought off some recondite plot for the confounding, of Bradman or McCabe or Ernest Tyldesley or Edward Paynter, well, then he was happy beyond computing."", 'Yet his bowling achievements, pressed into but overflowing the ten years of his career, were so rich and various that they here demand some concentrated notice. ', 'He played in 40 Test matches, taking 144 wickets at 24.37 runs each. He took 100 wickets in Test cricket in a shorter period than any other English bowler.', ""He is the only cricketer who has taken 14 wickets in a day in a Test match, this feat being performed against Australia at Lord's in the second Test, 1934. During this match, he took 15 wickets for 104 runs, thus sharing with Wilfred Rhodes, his Yorkshire predecessor, the honour of taking most wickets in an England v. Australia match."", 'Twice he took all 10 wickets in an innings; in 1931, against Warwickshire at Headingley, Leeds, for 36 runs in 18.4 (6-ball) overs, 6 maidens; in 1932, on the same ground, against Nottinghamshire, for 10 runs in 19.4 (6-ball) overs, 16 maidens - a world record in first-class cricket for the fewest number of runs conceded by a bowler taking all 10 wickets in an innings, and it included the hat-trick.', 'Against Essex at Leyton, in 1933, he took 17 wickets in one day, a record shared only by C. Blythe and T.W. Goddard.', 'In each of his nine full English seasons he took at least 150 wickets, and he averaged 185 wickets a season; thrice consecutively (1935-36-37) he took over 200 wickets. His average ranged from 12.42 to 17.63. He headed the first-class English bowling averages in his first season (1930) and in his last (1939), and never came out lower than fifth.', 'Verity was born at Headingley, but passed his twenty-fifth birthday before he played for Yorkshire, in 1930, the year that W. Rhodes retired. Some of his earlier seasons were spent in playing as an amateur for Rawdon in the Yorkshire Council; for Accrington in the Lancashire League; and for Middleton in the Central League. He was then, as always afterwards when allowed, an all-rounder. As a batsman, his height, reach, concentration and knowledge of what to avoid raised him distinctly from the ruck of mediocrity; but, whereas his bowling included grace, his batting had only style. The former was nature embellished by art; the latter was art improved by invention.', 'As a bowler, Hedley Verity stands, and will stand, with his illustrious predecessors in the Yorkshire attack: Edmund Peate (1879-1887), Robert Peel (1882-1899), Wilfred Rhodes (1898-1930) - the dates indicate the time of their respective playing careers - but Verity was not a slow left-hander in the accepted sense, and he used to reject comparision with Rhodes so far as method was concerned, saying: ""both of us are left-handed and like taking wickets; let\'s leave it at that.""', "" Verity's mean pace was what is called slow-medium; on fast pitches, often about medium; and he would send down an inswinging yorker of an abrupt virulence not unworthy of George Hirst."", 'Naturally, on wet or crumbled or sticky pitches, he reduced pace and tossed the leg-spinner higher, but even here his variety of pace and of angle of delivery was remarkable. He was a born schemer; tireless, but never wild, in experiment; as sensitive in observation as a good host, or as an instrumentalist who spots a rival on the beat; the scholar who does not only dream, the inventor who can make it work.', 'Just how good a bowler was he? In relation to rivals in his own craft but of an earlier day, such a question is useless except to amuse an idle hour or to excite and idle quarrel. We can only say that, in his own short time, he was the best of his kind. In England, day in and day out, he may never have quite touched the greatness of Robert Peel, Colin Blythe or Wilfred Rhodes. In Australia, neither in 1932-33 or 1936-37, did he perplex their batsmen quite as J.C. White perplexed them in 1928-29, but, as a workman-artist, he will take some beating. H.B. Cameron, that fine wicket-keeper-batsman of South Africa, playing against Yorkshire in 1935, hit him for three fours and three sixes in one over; but very rarely did a batsman survive a liberty taken with Verity. He had, besides, a wonderful skill in restoring the ""rabbits"", early and with little inconvenience, to the hutch.', 'If a touchstone of Verity\'s greatness be needed, there is D.G. Bradman, the most inexorable scorer of runs that cricket has yet seen, whose Test match average against England stands at 91.42 in 46 innings. I think it was Verity who kept that average under 150. He was one of only three or four bowlers who came to the battle with Bradman on not unequal terms (haud impar congressus!); and Bradman was reported as saying: ""I think I know all about Clarrie (Grimmett), but with Hedley I am never sure. You see, there\'s no breaking point with him.""', 'Verity timed his blows. In the fifth Test match, at Sydney, early in 1933, Australia, 19 runs behind on the first innings, lost Victor Richardson for 0. Woodfull and Bradman added 115; Larwood, injured, had left the field - and that particular Larwood never came back - then Verity deceived Bradman in flight, bowled him for 71 and went on to take five for 33 in 19 overs and win the match. In the earlier Tests, amid the fast bowling and the clamour, not much had been heard of Verity, except as a rescuing batsman. But, when the last pinch came, there he was to relieve the weary line; very Yorkshire.', 'Verity never allowed the opinion that Bradman was less than a master on damaged pitches, refusing to stress the evidence of his own triumph at Lord\'s in 1934 (Bradman c and b Verity 36; c Ames b Verity 13) and referring to Bradman\'s two innings of 59 and 43 in 1938 against Yorkshire at Sheffield. ""It was a pig of a pitch,"" he said, ""and he played me in the middle of the bat right through."" Maybe Verity\'s opinion of Bradman was heightened by a natural generosity in its giver, but on this matter I think that Verity had reason to know best.', ""As an all-round fielder, Verity was no more than sound, but to his own bowling, or at backward point, he sometimes touched brilliance; and there sticks in the memory the catch that he made at Lord's in 1938, when McCabe cut one from Farnes crack from the bat's middle."", 'As a batsman for Yorkshire, Verity was mostly kept close to the extras. His build and reach suggested power and freedom, but it remained a suggestion; and he was analogous to those burly golfers who prod the tee-shot down the middle to a prim 180 yards. A casual observer might have mistaken Verity for Sutcliffe a little out of form, for he seemed to have caught something of that master\'s style and gesture, and , like Sutcliffe, he could be clean bowled in a manner that somehow exonerated the batsman from all guilt. He never quite brought off ""the double"", though in 1936 he took 216 wickets and scored 855 runs. But he had the sovereign gift of batting to an occasion. In the 1936-37 visit to Australia, G.O. Allen could find no opening pair to stay together, so he sent in Verity with C.J. Barnett in the fourth Test, at Adelaide, and they put up partnerships of 53 and 45. Not much, perhaps; but the best till then. In all Test matches, his batting average was close on 21; nearly 3 units higher than his average in all first-class cricket.', 'Verity had the look and carriage of a man likely to do supremely well something that would need time and trouble. His dignity was not assumed; it was the natural reflection of mind and body harmonised and controlled. He was solid, conscientious, disciplined; and something far more. In all that he did, till his most gallant end, he showed the vital fire, and warmed others in its flame. To the spectator in the field he may have seemed, perhaps, a little stiff and aloof; but among a known company he revealed geniality, wit, and an unaffected kindness that will not be forgotten.', 'There was no ""breaking-point"" with Verity; and his last reported words: ""Keep going,"" were but a text on his short and splendid life.']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1932'],40.0,44,12,669.0,66*,20.9,,,0,3,,0,30,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,378.0,416,106,5603,101,18.07,,,1,13,,,269,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.0,73,11173,3510,144.0,8/43,15/104,24.37,1.88,77.5,9,5,2,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,378.0,,84219,29145,1956,10/10,,14.90,2.07,43.0,,164,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

6 ft 2 in ",,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm offbreak,Commentator,,,"['\nOn September 12, 2005, Michael Vaughan secured his place in English sporting history by becoming the first captain to win an Ashes series since Mike Gatting in 1986-87. It was the culmination of a five-year journey for Vaughan, whose captaincy - calm, obdurate and ruthlessly effective - had become as classy and composed as the batting technique that, briefly, carried him to the top of the world rankings.  \n', 'With a priceless ability to treat triumph and disaster just the same, Vaughan faced up to his first ball in Test cricket with England four wickets down for two runs on a damp flyer at Johannesburg in November 1999 and drew immediate comparisons with Michael Atherton for his inhumanly calm aura at the crease. But, despite the obvious similarities between the two - from their Mancunian heritage to their indifference to sledging - Vaughan soon demonstrated he was more than just a like-for-like replacement. Once he had made the place his own, Vaughan blossomed magnificently, playing with a freedom of expression that Atherton had never dared to approach. ', ""He sparkled his way to 900 runs in seven Tests against Sri Lanka and India in 2002, the prelude to a formidable series in Australia in which he became the first visiting batsman for 32 years to top 600 runs. Despite the fact that his one-day record at the time scarcely matched up to his impressive Test figures, he was appointed captain of England's one-day side in time for the 2003 home season, and inherited the Test captaincy two weeks later when Nasser Hussain abdicated out of the blue. Hussain, astutely, had spotted Vaughan's burgeoning man-management abilities, and despite a torrid baptism, including a record-breaking defeat at Lord's, Vaughan guided his team to a 2-2 draw. After a stutter in Sri Lanka, he confirmed the arrival of a new era by routing West Indies on their home soil, the first time in three decades an England team had achieved such a feat. "", 'Returning home, he missed the opening Test of the summer but returned to guide England to a summer clean sweep with victories over first New Zealand (3-0) then West Indies (4-0), went on to record a memorable 2-1 series win in South Africa, and then achieved Nirvana with a 2-1 triumph in arguably the greatest series of all time. ', ""But then came a terrible hiatus. A recurrence of an old knee injury meant that Marcus Trescothick stood in for the first Test of the post-Ashes era, in Pakistan, and the seriousness of the issue really became clear three months later in India, when he was forced home for a series of operations that wrecked his 2006 season and ensured he would not be fit to lead England's return trip to Australia. Andrew Flintoff took over the captaincy, but the calls for Vaughan's return grew louder as England were bundled ever closer to their eventual 5-0 whitewash. "", 'Vaughan was duly recalled, as captain, for the one-day series in spite of a debilitating hamstring strain that reduced him to just three appearances out of ten in a victorious CB Series campaign. He limped his way through the World Cup, in every sense of the word, becoming an increasing liability in the top order. Two months later he quit the limited-overs captaincy, but by then he had re-established himself at the helm of the Test side. ', ""He scored a memorable century on home turf at Headingley in his comeback game, before going on to overhaul Peter May's record of 20 wins as England captain. But he was never quite the same. Results faded and, after defeat to South Africa at Edgbaston, he emotionally resigned although vowed to play on. He was rewarded for his services with another ECB central contract that September, but as the 2009 Ashes drew closer it became apparent that his form was not going to return. Without having played another Test match, he took the decision in June 2009 to retire from all cricket with immediate effect.\n"", ' ']","['PCA Player of the Year 2002', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2003', 'Awarded the OBE on 31st December 2005']",82.0,147,9,5719.0,197,41.44,11184,51.13,18,18,742,22,44,0,86.0,83,10,1982.0,90*,27.15,2898,68.39,0,16,204,13,25.0,0.0,2.0,2,0,27.0,27,13.50,22,122.72,0,0,4,0,0.0,0.0,268.0,468,27,16295,197,36.95,,,42,68,,,118,0,282.0,273,25,7238,125*,29.18,,,3,46,,,88.0,0.0,18.0,18,1,319,41*,18.76,284,112.32,0,0,31,5,2.0,0.0,82.0,35,978,561,6.0,2/71,2/71,93.5,3.44,163.0,0,0,0,86.0,28,796,649,16.0,4/22,4/22,40.56,4.89,49.7,1,0,0,2.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,268.0,,9342,5245,114,4/39,,46.00,3.36,81.9,,0,0,282.0,,3381,2604,78,4/22,4/22,33.38,4.62,43.3,4,0,0,18.0,5,54,81,1,1/21,1/21,81.00,9.00,54.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Add to this his 220 catches and his captaincy, from 1948 to 1955, of a team containing some strong-willed characters, and his place among Yorkshire captains may be seen as pre-eminent. He led the White Rose county to the Championship in 1949 (shared with Middlesex) and to runners-up position four times in the next six years.', ""Having toured India with Tennyson's side in 1937-38, he was chosen for MCC's tour of South Africa the following winter, and made his Test debut at Johannesburg in the opening Test, having been England's 12th man in the preceding home series against Australia. He scored only 7 at The Wanderers, and did not bowl, and that was the end of his Test cricket until after the war, during which he served in the Green Howards in the Middle East and Italy, being wounded in the Western Desert."", ""Chosen at Hammond's vice-captain on the first post-war tour of Australia, Yardley earned enduring fame by capturing Bradman's wicket ( l. b. w., bowled, and c&b) in three successive innings - at Sydney when the Australian captain had made 234, and twice at Melbourne, when Yardley took five wickets in the match and scored 61 and 53 not out, the first England player to chain a pair of half-centuries to five wickets in a Test match."", ""He did little else in the series, though with Hammond's indisposition before the final Test, at Sydney, Yardley became England captain. He led England through the next two home series, winning against South Africa (3-0) in 1947, when Compton and Edrich were so destructive with the bat, and losing 0-4 to the 1948 Australians. In the Nottingham Test against South Africa he had made his highest Test score: 99, caught by Tuckett off Ossie Dawson from a nervy stroke, ironic in that he was renowned for his leg-side play. His stand with Compton had been worth a record 237, and Evans went on to make 74 before Martin and Hollies added a vital 51 for the last wicket to put victory beyond South Africa's grasp.

He averaged nearly 47 in Tests, and over fifty in first-class cricket, making 39 first-class hundreds. He would have undoubtedly played more Test cricket if it were not for the war. An unspectacular bat, he was a superb glancer, and deft placer of the ball. He had a full range of shots, however, and was hard to tie down. \n', ""Brown's cricket career got off to a most inauspicious start when in his debut first-class innings for New South Wales in 1932 he was run out for a duck without facing a ball. He made a good impression in the Sheffield Shield, and to the surprise of some was picked to tour England in 1934. He had an outstanding tour; his 119 against Lancashire earned him a place in the first Test, where his second innings 73 helped Australia earn victory after Woodfull, Ponsford and Bradman had failed. He made his debut Test hundred in the second Test, as Australia experienced a rare loss at Lord's, and was promoted to open with Ponsford in the third Test where he made a useful 72. He failed in the final two Tests, but had proven himself as a Test player of class, ending up third in the Test averages."", ""He scored consistently on the 1935-36 tour of South Africa, with four fifties and a century in the five Tests, but was less successful in the two home Tests he played against England. 1936 saw him accept a coaching position in Brisbane and he represented Queensland from 1936-37. In 1937-38 he was appointed Queensland captain and by 1938 he was at the height of his ability, and stood out in a side marked by outstanding batsmen (Bradman, Fingleton, McCabe and Hassett). He made a century in the first Test after Australia had followed on, and he carried his bat for a superb unbeaten 206 at Lord's. He missed the third Test through injury, but was the top Australian scorer in either innings at the Oval Test so dominated by Hutton."", 'During the war he served in the Pacific with the RAAF as a flight lieutenant. After the war he was not the dominating player he had been before, and he had lost possibly his most productive cricket years. He did captain Australia in their inaugural Test against New Zealand, presiding over a 2-day rout, and making the highest score of the match. In the final Test against India in 1947-48 he was most unluckily run out for 99, but was chosen to tour England with the ""Invincibles"" in 1948. He played in the first two Tests but then lost his place to Neil Harvey. He made eight centuries on that tour, but with the advent of fine young players like Morris and Harvey, he retired at the end of the following season after captaining the Australian second team to New Zealand.

1.91 m ",,,Right-hand bat,"Right-arm fast-medium, Legbreak",,,,"['\nWarwick Windridge Armstrong was a huge figure in Australian cricket, both\nliterally and metaphorically. Known as the ""Big Ship"" on account of his\nsheer physical size, the larger than life Armstrong gained dual reputations\nas a brilliantly enigmatic all-rounder and a player who flouted officialdom\nthroughout his career.  After making his debut for Victoria in 1898-99, the name that he made for himself on the field of play was as a forceful batsman, tidy legspin bowler, and ultimately one of Australia\'s finest ever captains. Following a string of consistent performances for Victoria, he was selected to represent the national team for the first time in 1901-02 and made an immediate\nimpact, joining with Reg Duff to register the first ever century partnership\nfor the last wicket in a Test match. \n', ""Such was the extent of Armstrong's success in the Test arena that his hold\non a berth in the Australian side was only disrupted by his decision to\ndecline to tour England in 1912 as a protest against the means by which the\nBoard of Control had decided that the team would be managed.  Even after\nsuch an open act of truculence, Armstrong remained extremely highly\nregarded, however, and was not only re-included in the side for Australia's\nvery next Test match but was also promoted to the position of captain!  It\nwas in the subsequent ten games in which he carved the clearest niche for\nhimself as one of the most successful players ever to don a baggy green cap;\nas Australia's leader, he guided the team to eight straight Test wins before\nclosing with two draws."", ""Overall, Armstrong participated in 269 first-class matches, scored in excess\nof 16,000 runs and captured over 800 wickets. He also played in 50 Tests\nover a period that spanned close to two decades in total. To honour his\ncontribution to the sport and his success therein, he was bestowed with\nseveral awards, the most recent of which came in early 2000 when he was\nposthumously inducted into Australian cricket's Hall of Fame. "", ""\nWhile a great allround player, he remains in one's memory chiefly for his unequalled triumph in leading Australia to victory in eight consecutive Tests with England. After the first world war our cricket took a long time to settle down. During this period the England touring team, led by  JWHT Douglas, lost all five matches, and the following summer Armstrong commanded Australia, who won the first three Tests and drew the other two. In that superb manner Armstrong terminated a remarkable career. Of colossal build at 42, Armstrong then weighed about 22 stone and bore himself in a way likely to cause offence, but he invariably carried his desires over all opposition and sometimes with good reason."", ""Born on May 22, 1879, Armstrong rose to prominence in the season of 1901-02, when he did well for Victoria before playing in the Tests of which AC MacLaren's team won the first and lost the other four. Armstrong headed the Australian Test averages, thanks to being not out four times. His bowling then was hardly wanted, but, coming to England under Joe Darling, he took 81 wickets at 17.50 runs each, besides scoring 1087 runs, average 26. He surpassed these efforts on his second trip to England, making 2002 runs, average 48.82, and taking 130 wickets at 17.60 apiece, being top of both averages. These figures constitute a record, no other visitor to England having scored 2000 runs and taken 100 wickets in a season. His 303 not out at Bath was the highest innings hit on the tour, and his 248 not out contributed largely to victory by an innings and 189 runs over the Gentlemen at Lord's."", ""If not quite so successful in 1909 he scored 1480 runs, average 46.39, and claimed 126 wickets at 16.23, being second in each table and by far the most effective bowler. He was absent from the Australian team that came over for the Triangular Tournament in 1912, but when he captained the 1921 side with such marked success he ranked third in batting and top of the bowling. With 1405 runs, average 43.90, and 106 wickets, average 14.56, he for the third time accomplished the cricketer's double, so equalling the record for any Australian in England established by George Giffen twenty-five years before. In four tours in England he helped Australia win the Test rubber three times, the exception being in 1905, when FS Jackson won the toss in each of the five matches."", ""He was fortunate to lead a very powerful combination, with JM Gregory and EA McDonald, the fast bowlers, too much for England's impoverished batting, while Macartney and Bardsley headed an exceptional array of batting talent, eight men having aggregates ranging from 2335 to 1032, with averages from 58 to 30. The only defeats suffered by that 1921 team were at Eastbourne and Scarborough when the serious part of the tour was over. Armstrong led Australia to victory at Nottingham, Lord's and Leeds before rain ruined the Manchester match, and England recovered something of her lost prestige at The Oval."", ""On that occasion Warwick Armstrong acted in an extraordinary manner by way of emphasising his opinion that all Test matches should be played to a finish irrespective of time. When a draw was certain he rested his regular bowlers, went into the long field himself, an unknown position for him, and actually picked up and read a fully extended newspaper that was blown from the crowd! Clearly he was then indifferent to what happened; but he was very much alert a few weeks before at Old Trafford, where the England captain erred over a declaration. Rain prevented play on Saturday, and so the match became an affair of two days. With England's score over 300 for four wickets the Hon LH Tennyson, at ten minutes to six, went on to the field and called the players in. Ernest Tyldesley and PGH Fender, the batsmen, left the field, but Armstrong demurred and sat on the turf near the stumps where he had been bowling. After a wait the Australians and umpires went to the pavilion, and Armstrong pointed out that the law, amended in 1914, showed that a closure in the circumstances of a lost first day could not be made later than an hour and forty minutes before the time for drawing stumps. It was amazing that no England official or player in the pavilion knew enough to prevent such a lamentable blunder; that the captain should be corrected by his Australian rival was a humiliating incident. The umpires, also at fault of course, were so muddled that when, after twenty minutes delay, play was resumed, Armstrong himself was allowed to commit an error by bowling the next over -- two in succession."", ' Armstrong established a record by playing in 42 Test matches against England -- one more than Clem Hill. In these games he scored 2172 runs, average 35.03, and took 74 wickets at an average cost of 30.91. He made four Test centuries against England -- all in Australia -- and in ten Tests with South Africa he twice reached three figures. Altogether 46 centuries stand to his name in first-class cricket. With MA Noble, Armstrong put on 428 at Hove against Sussex in 1902 -- still an Australian record for the sixth wicket. In Sheffield Shield matches Armstrong scored 4,993 runs, average 49.93, and took 177 wickets at 24.16 runs apiece. At Melbourne in November 1920 he made two centuries for Victoria against South Australia -- 157 not out and 245. In November 1912, in the corresponding match, also at Melbourne, he scored 250, his highest innings in these tournaments.', 'Very tall and slim when first coming to England, Armstrong was of quite different build nineteen years later, and his massive frame made him a dominating personality as captain, quite apart from his ability with bat and ball. If appearing ungainly at the wicket because of bent knees, almost inevitable in the case of such a big man, Armstrong was a splendid stroke player, with the drive and cut most in evidence, and his defence was untiring. Bowling slows, usually round the wicket from a great height, he did not turn the ball a lot, but his leg theory was so pronounced that on occasions he sent down over after over wide of the leg stump without being punished, because he dropped the ball with what really was deceptive flight and usually very little break. Against a field cleverly placed for catches, batsmen refrained from taking risks. In fact, Armstrong was adept at keeping down runs in emergency. John Tyldesley, at The Oval in 1905, countered this, stepping back a yard and cutting the alleged leg-breaks where no fieldsman stood.', 'Like many cricketers, after retiring from active participation in the game, Armstrong wrote for the Press, and his caustic Test criticisms created ill-feeling of a kind which should not be associated with cricket.\n']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1903', 'Australian Cricket Hall of Fame 2000']",50.0,84,10,2863.0,159*,38.68,,,6,8,,,44,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,269.0,406,61,16158,303*,46.83,,,45,57,,,273,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50.0,80,8022,2923,87.0,6/35,7/166,33.59,2.18,92.2,3,3,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,269.0,,43297,16405,832,8/47,,19.71,2.27,52.0,,50,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

","['\nSir Donald Bradman of Australia was, beyond any argument, the greatest batsman who ever lived and the greatest cricketer of the 20th century. Only WG Grace, in the formative years of the game, even remotely matched his status as a player. And The Don lived on into the 21st century, more than half a century after he retired. In that time, his reputation not merely as a player but as an administrator, selector, sage and cricketing statesman only increased. His contribution transcended sport; his exploits changed Australia\'s relationship to what used to be called the ""mother country"". \n', ""Throughout the 1930s and 40s Bradman was the world's master cricketer, so far ahead of everyone else that comparisons became pointless. In 1930, he scored 974 runs in the series, 309 of them in one amazing day at Headingley, and in seven Test series against England he remained a figure of utter dominance; Australia lost the Ashes only once, in 1932-33, when England were so spooked by Bradman that they devised a system of bowling, Bodyline, that history has damned as brutal and unfair, simply to thwart him. He still averaged 56 in the series. "", 'In all, he went to the crease 80 times in Tests, and scored 29 centuries. He needed just four in his last Test innings, at The Oval in 1948, to ensure an average of 100 \xad- but was out second ball for 0, a rare moment of human failing that only added to his everlasting appeal. Bradman made all those runs at high speed in a manner that bewildered opponents and entranced spectators. Though his batting was not classically beautiful, it was always awesome.', ' \n', '\n""He\'s out!"" - to the thousands who read them, whether they were interested in cricket or not, the two words blazoned across the London evening newspaper placards could have meant only one thing: somewhere, someone had managed to dismiss Don Bradman, of itself a lifelong claim to fame.', 'Sir Donald George Bradman was, without any question, the greatest phenomenon in the history of cricket, indeed in the history of all ball games. To start with, he had a deep and undying love of cricket, as well, of course, as exceptional natural ability. It was always said he could have become a champion at squash or tennis or golf or billiards, had he preferred them to cricket. The fact that, as a boy, he sharpened his reflexes and developed his strokes by hitting golf ball with a cricket stump as it rebounded off a water tank attests to his eye, fleetness of foot and, even when young, his rare powers of concentration.', 'Bradman himself was of the opinion that there were other batsmen, contemporaries of his, who had the talent to be just as prolific as he was but lacked the concentration. ', ', who needed a particular challenge to bring the best of him, was no doubt one of them. ""I wish I could bat like that"", Bradman\'s assessment of McCabe\'s 232 in the Trent Bridge Test of 1938, must stand with W.G.\'s ""Give me Arthur"" [Shrewsbury], when asked to name the best batsman he had played with, as the grandest tribute ever paid by one great cricketer to another.', 'So, with the concentration and the commitment and the calculation and the certainty that were synonymous with Bradman, went a less obvious but no less telling humility. He sought privacy and attracted adulation.', 'How did anyone ever get him out? The two bowlers to do it most often, if sometimes at horrendous cost, were both spinners - ', ', who had ten such coups to his credit with leg-breaks and googlies, and ', ', who also had ten, eight of them for England. Is there anything, I wonder, to be deduced from this? Both, for example, had a flattish trajectory, which may have deterred Bradman from jumping out to drive, something he was always looking to do.', 'Grimmett was not, in fact, the only wrist-spinner to make the great man seem, at times, almost mortal. ', ' was another - Bradman called him the finest and therefore, presumably, the most testing bowler he played against - as were Ian Peebles and Walter Robins; and it was with a googly that Eric Hollies bowled him for a duck in his last Test innings, at The Oval in 1948, when he was within four runs of averaging 100 in Test cricket. Perhaps, very occasionally, he did have trouble reading wrist-spin; but that, after all, is its devious purpose.', 'By his own unique standards, Bradman was discomfited by Bodyline, the shameless method of attack which ', ' employed to depose him in Australia in 1932-33. Discomfited, yes - but he still averaged 56.57 in the Test series. If there really is a blemish on his amazing record it is, I suppose, the absence of a significant innings on one of those ""sticky dogs"" of old, when the ball was hissing and cavorting under a hot sun following heavy rain. This is not to say he couldn\'t have played one, but that on the big occasion, when the chance arose, he never did.', 'His dominance on all other occasions was absolute. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow called the Don ""that rarest of Nature\'s creatures, a genius with an eye for business."" He could be 250 not out and yet still scampering the first run to third man or long leg with a view to inducing a fielding error. Batsmen of today would be amazed had they seen it, and better cricketers for having done so. It may be apocryphal, but if, to a well-wisher, he did desire his 309 not out on the first day of the Headingley Test of 1930 as a nice bit of practice for tomorrow, he could easily have meant it.', ""He knows as well as anyone, though, that with so much more emphasis being placed on containment and so many fewer overs being bowled, his 309 of 70 years ago would be nearer 209 today.

December 10, 1847, Sydney, New South Wales ","November 21, 1907, East Bendigo, Victoria (aged 59 years 346 days) ",,"['Australia,', 'Victoria']",,,,,Right-hand bat,,,,,"['\nHenry Frederick Boyle, more than anyone else, except Spofforth and Blackham, made the fame of the first Australian XI in England in 1878. He was a Sydney man by birth, but he went to live in Victoria when only three years old, and with Victorian cricket he was always associated. He took to the game when quite a small boy, and at the age of fifteen he played for twenty-two of Sandhurst against Victoria. When in December, 1873, W. G. Grace""s eleven played their first match at Melbourne, Boyle appeared for the Eighteen of Victoria, who beat the Englishmen in a single innings, and to the end of his life he recalled with pride the fact that he bowled down W.G.""s wicket. In addition to Boyle, the Victorian team included Frank Allan, Thomas Horan, B. B. Cooper-so well known in England a few years earlier as a batsman-W. Midwinter, John Conway, the manager of the Australian eleven of 1878, and the once famous bowler Sam Cosstick. It is no injustice to Boyle to say that he was a far greater cricketer in England than in Australia. When he came to this country in 1878 he was not regarded as anything like such a good bowler as Allan, but whereas he enjoyed a triumph, Allan gave way before the rigors of a very ungenial summer, and only once or twice did himself justice. It is a very old story now to tell how Spofforth and Boyle on the 27th of May, 1878, dismissed the M. C. C. for totals of 33 and 19, and in one afternoon established for good and all the reputation of Australian cricket. In the eleven-a-side matches of that memorable tour Boyle took 63 wickets, coming out a very respectable second to Spofforth who took 123. Visiting England for the second time in 1880 he did not have many opportunities in first-class matches, the Australian programme that year, owing to the unfortunate incident at Sydney during the tour of Lord Harris""s eleven in 1878-79, being largely restricted to games with local eighteens. Boyle however, made the most of such chances as he enjoyed. Indeed, he perhaps never bowled better than when, towards the end of the season, Spofforth""s accident threw the whole responsibility upon him and George Palmer. In the England match at\nthe Oval the two bowlers got five wickets down for 31 runs, when Englandwent in with 57 runs to get in the last innings. It was, however, in the great tour of 1882, that Boyle reached his highest point. He bowled down the last wicket when the Australians gained their famous victory by seven runs against England at the Oval, and in the eleven-a-side matches he took 144 wickets, finishing at the top of the bowling averages with Spofforth, Palmer, and Garrett below him. The tour of 1882 was the climax of his career. From that time his powers as a bowler began to wane. In 1884, when for the first time he experienced a real English summer, he only took 67 wickets as against 216 by Spofforth, and 132 by Palmer, and in 1888, when Turner and Ferris did such wonderful things, he was quite an unimportant member of the team. He paid his last visit to England as manager of the 1890 eleven. Boyle as a bowler relied mainly upon headwork and accuracy of length, and had no very remarkable break. Like Alfred Shaw, though his style did not in any way resemble that of the English blower, he was satisfied if he could make the ball do just enough to beat the bat. No one was quicker to discover a batsman""s weakness, or more persevering in turning his knowledge to account. He could peg away at the wicket for an hour without ever bowling a bad ball, and he was never afraid of pitching one up to be hit. No doubt his very high delivery helped to make him deceptive in the flight and awkward in his quick rise off the pitch. Apart from his bowling, Boylewill be remembered as perhaps the most daring fieldsman Australia has ever produced. The position he made for himself at short mid-on was not of much use on very fast wickets, but on the slow grounds in 1878, 1880 and 1882 he brought off any number of catches. Moreover, the mere fact of his standing so dangerously close in, caused many English batsmen to lose their wickets. Of course he got some ugly knocks at times, but he was quite fearless and did not mind how hard the ball was hit at him. E. M. Grace is proud of the fact that he alone gave him a fright and caused him to stand further back.\n', ' \n']",[],12.0,16,4,153.0,36*,12.75,,,0,0,,0,10,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,140.0,215,48,1711,108,10.24,,,1,1,,,126,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12.0,21,1743,641,32.0,6/42,7/69,20.03,2.20,54.4,0,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,140.0,,16365,5692,370,7/32,,15.38,2.08,44.2,,26,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

","[""\nAllan Border parlayed three shots and a fanatical zeal about not giving away his wicket into the most durable career that cricket in his time had known. At his retirement he had featured in more Tests, more consecutive Tests, more Tests as captain and more catches than any other player - and a batting average of 50 as well. His underused left-arm spin once brought him 11 for 96 against West Indies, and he was also an artful one-day player with a deadly arm from short midwicket. Not a natural leader, nor a man of frills, he came reluctantly to the captaincy in a dark age for Australia after Kim Hughes' tearful resignation at Brisbane in 1984-85, but eventually applied himself to the task as proudly as to his batting. From the World Cup win in 1987 and regaining the Ashes two years later, Australia crusaded under Border until in 1993 they came within one ball of conquering the world by beating West Indies. After he retired from Test cricket he played in Queensland's maiden Sheffield Shield win, was named 12th man in Australia's Team of the Century, coached Australia A, and became a selector in 1998. He resigned his post in Trevor Hohns' panel in 2005 in favour of pursuing his media interests, particularly as a pay-television pundit, but he returned a year later to assist the new chairman Andrew Hilditch. Four months after re-joining he suddenly stepped down again due to expanding business commitments.

He was not always the most stylish player, but for what he lacked in fluency he more than compensated with his ardour for occupying the crease and accumulating runs when they were most needed. As an 18 year old, Boon played a starring role in Tasmania's history-making Gillette Cup win in 1978-79, the state's first interstate one-day title, and he never really looked back over the course of an elite-level career which spanned 17 years. Among many highlights were his roles in four Ashes series wins, particularly the 1989 triumph and his honour in hitting the series-winning runs; his flawless unbeaten 184 in the Bicentenary Test of 1988; and his Man-of-the-Match winning effort in the 1987 World Cup final. Predominantly in the No. 3 position, Boon's durability was a vital ingredient in Australia's resurgence as a cricketing power in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His courage was often at the core of Australian performances and it was common to see his belligerent square cutting, driving and pulling upsetting the rhythm of even the finest of bowlers.  \n"", 'Aside from a range of triumphs with Australia during 107 Tests and 181 ODIs, Boon also led Durham in the English County Championship between 1997 and 1999, guiding the side to its best finish in the last of these three years. He was also appointed to the post of Tasmania captain at different ends of his career and was at the helm when his state enjoyed a fruitful first-class season in 1997-98. After retiring from all cricket following the completion of the 1999 county program, Boon accepted a position in marketing with the Tasmanian Cricket Association in Hobart and in 2000 replaced Geoff Marsh, his mate and former opening partner, as an Australia selector. In 2011, he took a new step as an ICC match referee, with his first fixture coming in Bulawayo, where Zimbabwe took on Pakistan. His legend also lives on at the NTCA ground in his home city of Launceston where a major stand has been named after him.

While capable of playing anywhere, he was generally used as an opener or No. 3 and brought to those roles a calm and assured presence. In addition to his abilities with the bat, Blewett, the son of the former South Australia captain Bob Blewett, was an excellent fielder and a more than handy medium-pace bowler. \n"", 'Blewett made the most of his opportunities and worked hard to overcome his weaknesses - susceptibility to quality spin bowling and a flaw against balls moving in to him from the fast men - achieving a number of notable distinctions. He scored centuries in each of his first two Tests, joining Bill Ponsford and Doug Walters as the only Australians to do so, was involved with Steve Waugh in one of the highest partnerships in Test history of 385 at Johannesburg in 1997, and accomplished the rare feat of compiling two 99s in Tests in the one calendar year. Blewett never established himself as a permanent member of either the Australian Test or ODI team, but he became widely recognised as a steely and dependable player whose capacity to play both defensive and attacking innings made him one of the stars of Australian domestic cricket. However, his early 30s were not as productive as the 20s, with back and hand injuries worrying him three seasons ago, and back and thigh problems troubling him last summer, which ended in him being dropped from the Pura Cup side.

Bichel was anything but quiet as he crashed through state batting orders and developed so much as a batsman that not even the most sceptical critic could knock back his membership as an allrounder. Bevan and Bichel, two heroes of the 2003 World Cup, did not have their contracts renewed in 2004 so they decided to become born-again stars of the domestic scene.  \n', 'In 2005-06, at the age of 35, Bichel was named the Pura Cup Player of the Year for his double of 452 runs at 34.76 and 50 wickets at 26.69. The final act of his summer was to seal Queensland the trophy by taking the last wicket at the Gabba. In three campaigns he had captured 155 victims, including a haul of 45 in 2006-07 which was capped by a state-best 7 for 54. However, he suffered a serious shoulder injury in 2007 and appeared in only three first-class fixtures, although he smashed 125 in a tour game against Sri Lanka before undergoing surgery. He wanted to come back from the reconstruction, but the journey was too hard and he retired the following season with 430 wickets for Queensland in the Sheffield Shield. ', ""Bichel was a vibrant member of the state's drought-breaking Sheffield Shield win in 1994-95 and led the attack with Michael Kasprowicz for more than a decade before Kasprowicz stepped down. His best season came in 2004-05, when he knocked off Craig McDermott's Queensland record, as he picked up 60 Pura Cup victims in a desperate push to win a spot on a second Ashes tour. Instead he performed for Hampshire that winter - he also appeared for Worcestershire and Essex - and the promotion never came. "", ""During his international career Bichel spent a lot of time coming in and going out of the squad but rarely stopped smiling. A prolific 12th man, he played 19 Tests for 58 wickets from his gutsy fast bowling and posted a half-century against West Indies, a team he always seemed to lift for. His best figures of 5 for 60 came against them at Melbourne in 2000-01, he was involved in the crushing Frank Worrell Trophy-clinching win in the fourth Test of the teams' 1996-97 series, and dismissed Brian Lara seven times on the 2003 tour.

In Australia\'s group match against England at Port Elizabeth he claimed 7 for 20 with a scintillating display of bowling before sharing a 73-run ninth-wicket partnership with Bevan to nurse Australia to an unlikely but hugely satisfying victory. ""It was one of those perfect days,"" he said. Bichel also top scored for Australia with a vital half-century against New Zealand and finished the tournament with 16 wickets at 12.31 and 117 runs. Barely a year later he and Bevan were stripped of their green and gold status.', ""He maintained his links with the game after retiring and in 2009 was appointed coach of Papua New Guinea.

An essential part of the one-day outfit for a decade, especially when orchestrating calm chases in crises that often ended in last-over or last-ball heroics, he was cut from the contract list with two World Cup wins and kitbags full of highlights. He will long be remembered for his pair of sensational innings against West Indies at Sydney in 1996 and New Zealand at Melbourne in 2002, when nerveless batting and juggling of the tail secured nail-biting victories. Picking the gaps, running hard and knowing the right moment - and place - to hit a boundary were the hallmarks of his success. He was also a fine fieldsman and his left-arm wrist spin, which swung from erratic to more than useful, added to his lure and allowed him to play Tests as a batting allrounder.  \n"", 'Bevan enjoyed a promising start to his Test career with 82 in his debut innings and another two half-centuries in his first series against Pakistan in 1994-95, but he managed only a stop-start four-year campaign and was hindered by an inability to play the short ball at the highest level, which was strange as he had few problems with it in Australian or English domestic cricket. He never made a century, although he was twice unbeaten in the 80s when batting down the order and running out of partners against West Indies, who he upset with 15 wickets in the 1997-98 series. After that his Test career slid, but while he lost his baggy green he worked on making unforgettable memories in the green and gold one-day uniform, finishing with 232 appearances and a phenomenal average of 53.58 that was boosted by six centuries, 46 fifties and 67 not outs.', 'Born in Canberra, Bevan made his first-class debut in 1989-90 in South Australian colours, hitting a thrilling century in his first innings, before the completion of a 12-month stint at the Academy led to a move back to New South Wales. It was in Sydney that he began to make his greatest strides as a player, quickly assuming a regular middle-order berth in the strongest state team in the country and, aside from a poor run in 1992-93 which resulted in a brief omission, using it as a launching pad to the national team. Shortly after being cut by the Australian selectors - Trevor Hohns said his ""contribution to the one-day side had decreased"" - he signed a two-year deal with Tasmania and proved his days of domination were not finished when he struck a domestic record 1464 runs in the Pura Cup, including eight centuries. He was named the Pura Cup Player of the Year and his Bradmanesque scoring achieved an average of 97.60, but there was no return to the international arena and no sign of him being included for the 2007 World Cup. After a disrupted summer following a knee operation, he made brief appearances for Tasmania in 2005-06 and 2006-07.

He hit 141 against  England at  Lord's. In that tour he came in for much criticism for his custom of fielding at point or short-leg some five yards from the bat and almost on the pitch.  R. Pollard, batting for  England in the Test at  Old Trafford, ended the habit when he hit  Barnes in the ribs with the ball from a full-blooded stroke, which resulted in him spending ten days in hospital.

Only two of his countrymen, Sir Donald Bradman and AL Hassett, surpassed his record of 53 centuries -- 29 of them scored in England -- in first-class matches. As a stylist, Bardsley compared favourably with any left-hander of his day. His upright stance and eminently straight bat never failed to exercise a special charm upon spectators, and he used his feet to perfection while employing a wide variety of strokes. If less brilliant in cutting behind point than Clem Hill, he was stronger in hitting past cover and to leg and he possessed a specially powerful straight drive. \n', 'Born at Warren, New South Wales, on December 6, 1882, he was named after his home town. Educated at Forest Lodge Superior Public School, he played as a youngster for Glebe in the First Grade Competition, displaying such skill that by 1903-04 he found a place in the New South Wales team which met Queensland at Brisbane. It was in 1907-08, however, that he first attained real prominence. Then, in the second fixture between New South Wales and the MCC Touring Team, he scored a splendid 108, so that when rain, preventing cricket on the sixth day, caused the match to be left drawn, the State needed 12 runs for victory and had one wicket to fall.', ""Thenceforward Bardsley did not look back. In the 1908-09 season he scored in nine innings 748 runs, including 119 against South Australia, 192 against Victoria and, for the Australian XI against The Rest, 264. Despite these feats, he was not among the first men chosen to go to England in 1909, but on that tour he at once found his finest form and retained it. When hitting 136 and 130 from the England bowling at The Oval he became the first player of a list now grown to fourteen to hit two separate hundreds in a Test match. In that game, too, he and SE Gregory, by sharing an opening partnership of 180, set up a record for Australia against England. His total runs during the summer numbered 2,180, including seven centuries, average 46.39. When next coming to England in 1912 he did even better with eight centuries, an aggregate of 2441 and an average of 51.98. Again in 1921, this time with nine three-figure innings among his achievements, he exceeded 2000 runs and, as vice-captain of HL Collins's 1926 side, he obtained his third century against England. This was a memorable effort of 193 for which he carried his bat through an innings lasting over six and a half hours and realising 383. No higher individual score had at that time been registered in a Test match at Lord's, and of it "", ' said: Had Bardsley accomplished nothing else he would have justified his selection.', 'Altogether Bardsley represented Australia in 41 Test matches, scoring 2,469 runs in 66 innings, average 40.47. Besides the tours of England, he visited New Zealand in 1909-10 and 1923-24, South Africa in 1921-22, and also played cricket in Fiji, USA, Canada and Bermuda.', 'Sir Jack Hobbs said of Bardsley: I cannot imagine a nicer type of fellow.

After his first trip he paid five other visits to England, coming over with the teams of 1880, 1882, 1884, 1888 and 1893. He had his most vivid experiences in  England in connection with matches in which he did not personally meet with much success. He was not only on the side that in 1878 made the fame of Australian cricket for ever by beating MCC at Lord's in one afternoon, but he took part in the Test Match in this country at The Oval in 1880, and also in the unforgettable match on the same ground in 1882, when the Australians beat us by seven runs. Indeed, the catch -- quite an easy one -- by which he got rid of WG Grace in the last innings proved the turning-point of that tremendous struggle. Alec Bannerman among Australians was the most famous of all stonewalling batsmen; his patience was inexhaustible. It was said that the Sydney public had become tired of his super-caution when Lord Sheffield's eleven were out in Australia in 1891-92, and were inclined to barrack him, but that everyone spoke of him as Good old Alec, when he took seven hours and a half to score 91 in the match that gave the Australians the rubber against the Englishmen. In that innings of 91 -- spread over three days -- he scored from only five of the 204 balls bowled to him by Attewell. Still, though such a slow run-getter, he made many big scores, and as a partner to great hitters like Percy McDonnell, Bonnor and JJ Lyons he was invaluable. In Test Matches with England he scored 1105 runs with an average of 23.03, and for New South Wales v Victoria, 1209 runs with an average of 29.29. Apart from his batting he was a superb field at mid-off -- fast, sure, and untiring, and a wonderfully safe catch. When his active days as a player had ended he did excellent work as coach for the New South Wales Cricket Association. Alec Bannerman took his cricket very seriously. It was said of him, not ill-naturedly, that when in the match with England at The Oval in 1888 he was out to the finest of all the catches at cover slip ever brought off by George Lohmann, he talked about his bad luck, and of nothing else, for the rest of the afternoon.\n"", ' \n']",[],28.0,50,2,1108.0,94,23.08,,,0,8,,1,21,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,219.0,381,28,7816,134,22.14,,,5,30,,,154,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.0,4,292,163,4.0,3/111,3/111,40.75,3.34,73.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,219.0,,1295,656,22,3/12,,29.81,3.03,58.8,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He fitted in perfectly in his opening appearances - he replaced McGrath, who was caring for his sick wife - and at the age of 30 experienced a dream start as the Player of the Series with 20 wickets at 15.75 against South Africa. A gamble for the first game at Cape Town, he collected his baggy green and earned his side a victory with 5 for 55 and 4 for 34, the third-best match figures by an Australian debutant behind Bob Massie and Clarrie Grimmett.  \n', ""His home welcome was equally impressive as he helped up-end England with his extra lift, gained from his 197cm height, and regular seam movement. An uncomfortable prospect, especially early in a spell, he picked up 26 wickets at 17 in the Ashes to show there was life for Australia's bowling contingent after McGrath. Clark captured at least one victim in all ten innings against England and missed out only once in his opening nine Tests. Just when England thought they had left their Clark nightmares behind he popped up at Hampshire on a short-term visit and broke Michael Vaughan's hand. "", ""While Clark quickly became a fixture in the longer form, he was dropped from the one-day team during that season's CB Series and was considered too expensive for a 2007 World Cup berth. He vowed to improve his control and won a Caribbean reprieve when Brett Lee turned his ankle in New Zealand. There was one game against Ireland and he did not disappoint in more intermittent appointments, finishing with 39 ODI caps. After 34 Test wickets were added to his collection at an average of 26.52 against Sri Lanka, India and West Indies in 2007-08, his hold on a Test place became less secure. He was dropped in India in 2008 before struggling with an elbow injury at home, the surgery ruling him out of both series against South Africa. "", ""Called for the one-day tournament against Pakistan, he made a steady return in the United Arab Emirates instead of delivering long spells in the County Championship in preparation for the Ashes tour. He played two games in the defeat and started strongly at Leeds, but was unable to make an impact after being preferred to Nathan Hauritz at The Oval. He hasn't retired from internationals, but the rest of his career will be spent at New South Wales, who he captained either side of a back injury in 2009-10."", 'A former real-estate agent in Sydney who crams study for a masters degree in commerce, Clark had to wait to strike the right market after a battle with his body as much as his talent. Clark held a Cricket Australia contract after a 45-wicket season in 2001-02 before losing it a summer later when struck by ankle and rib injuries. Hernia surgery was next on the list followed quickly by a leg problem, but he collected 40 breakthroughs in 2004-05 to re-impress Trevor Hohns and his selection gang. ', 'While on a guest stint at Middlesex, Clark was called up as a squad replacement for the Ashes tour, although he did not get a playing opportunity. He made his ODI debut during the 2005 Super Series and was a sound limited-overs performer in his first summer. A child of English-born parents who met in India, he became a father in 2006 with the birth of a son, and his life after cricket is already mapped out.

His selection for the 1934 team to England came as something of a surprise, following only three first-class innings. He was then 28, but 152 for Northern Districts at Newcastle against Jardine's 1932-33 MCC side had given notice of his ability, and with 84 against Queensland on his début for New South Wales he furthered the good impression already made. In England, he did not enjoy the best of health, but he finished the tour with 899 runs and an average of 40.86, having shown himself as a batsman who, while essentially a front-foot player, possessing a sound defensive technique, could when the occasion demanded hit hard and score at a good pace. He was an uncommonly good slip fielder and a useful bowler of leg-breaks. \n"", ""A career-best 175 against Essex, in his first match in England, and 116 not out the following week against Hampshire, led to his inclusion for the First Test at Trent Bridge, where, having reached 99 by lunch on the second day, he was out without addition to the third ball afterwards, caught behind off Farnes. He was the first to be dismissed for 99 in his first Test, and had batted for three hours twenty minutes, his runs coming in the main from his square cutting. At Lord's, where Verity took fifteen wickets on a damp pitch, his unbeaten 37 was Australia's second-highest score of their first innings; his three for 91 in England's only innings were his best Test bowling figures. Chosen for the Manchester Test, despite suffering from an infection known colloquially as Wimbledon Throat, he left hospital against medical advice to score 26, which helped Australia avoid the follow-on. He then returned to hospital, the instance being one of the few in Test cricket (weather-related instances apart) of a player batting but never fielding. He played in the next two Tests, but on his second trip to England, in 1938, played only at Lord's, where he split his finger stopping a shot from Hammond in his innings of 240. Later in the tour he had to undergo an operation because of appendicitis, and so Lord's was the last of his Tests, in which he scored 552 runs, with an average of 32.47, took five wickets at 87.40, and held fifteen catches. His only Test hundred was 109 against South Africa in Durban in 1935-36. Altogether, in 96 first-class games, he scored 4,295 runs, average 38.34, took 65 wickets at 39.72, and held 92 catches. His best bowling was 8 for 66 for an Australian XI against MCC at Sydney in 1936-37, when he ended the touring team's first innings with a spell of 4 for 9.

Len Darling was athletically built and a graceful, dashing player with a fine array of attacking strokes which he used to good effect in the Sheffield Shield for Victoria from 1931-32 to 1936-37. He had few chances to show what he could do at Test level, but looked the part more than once before his sudden retirement at the end of 1936-37. \n', "" Darling, who was born at South Yarra in Victoria, played in his first senior match as a 17-year-old in 1926-27, but had to wait until 1928-29 before making his début in the Shield at Sydney in an amazing match. Victoria fought off defeat after New South Wales had declared at 713 for six, leaving Bradman 340 not out. Victoria inevitably followed on but, helped by 96 from Darling, gained an honourable draw. That season he hit 87 at Melbourne against an MCC team containing Larwood, Tate, Freeman and Geary in their attack. He made no showing again until 1931-32 when he made his maiden hundred and averaged 48.88 in the Shield. Next year he came right to the fore, averaging 69.14 in state matches with three hundreds, and was brought in to bolster Australia's beleaguered Test team for the last two Tests of the Bodyline series at Brisbane and Sydney. At Brisbane he was run out for 39 in the second innings; and at Sydney his attacking 85 was top score in a total of 435. Many thought he was less bothered by the onslaught of Larwood and company than anyone else except Stan McCabe. In 1933-34 he made his highest score, 188 against Queensland, and his 93 at Sydney in the final Shield match of the season enabled Victoria to draw and thus take the trophy by a single point."", 'In England in 1934 the other batsmen were dwarfed by Bradman and Ponsford. Darling played in the first four Tests, but achieved little, and ', "" commented on his tendency to flick at balls moving away. In other matches he played some delightful innings and made 1,022 runs on the tour at 34.06. Back at home in 1934-35, he was in brilliant form, hitting three hundreds in successive matches, and was an automatic choice for the 1935-36 tour of South Africa. There he had a much better series and averaged 45.80. Against England in 1936-37, Australia experimented with several young batsman and Darling was only included for the famous New Year Test at Melbourne; in front of a 65,000 crowd he held two brilliant catches to dispose Hammond and Leyland. At the end of the season, when he was only 27, he suddenly retired and moved to Adelaide; it was believed that marriage played an important part in his decision. He eventually became sales manager of the Adelaide Quarrying Company. In 100 first-class matches he made 5,780 runs for an average of 42.50, which included 16 hundreds. His total in 12 Tests was 474 runs at 27.88. He was a superb fielder in any position and a moderate right-arm medium-pace bowler, whose 32 first-class wickets cost exactly 47.

A left-handed batsman of medium height and robust build, Darling invariably opened the innings. Possibly he did not show the same style as Warren Bardsley or Clem Hill, but he seldom failed, and could defend with stubborn steadiness or pull a game round by determined forcing tactics. Besides his run-getting powers,  Darling in the field, notably at mid-off, held opposing batsmen in check, and as a captain he inspired his men to reveal their best form. Joseph Darling first came to England in 1896, and he captained the Australian sides that visited us in 1899, 1902 and 1905. \n"", ""Starting cricket when very young, he revealed remarkable ability just before his fifteenth birthday, when, in a two-day match for St Alfred's College on the Adelaide Oval, he scored 252 out of 470, so beating 209 by George Giffen - then the highest innings in the State. Farming occupied him for some years, and not until the 1893-94 season did he play for South Australia. Then he found his form, and next season against the England team, captained by A. E. Stoddart, he made 117 and 37 not out, so helping materially in a victory for  South Australia by six wickets. He averaged 38 against the Englishmen, and coming to England in 1896, he started at Sheffield Park with 67 and 35. In the Test matches of that tour he was not fortunate, but his value was established, and altogether he played in 31 matches for Australia against England and three against South Africa. Altogether in Test matches against England he made 1,632 runs, average 30.79. His highest score in England was 194 at Leicester in 1896, and an aggregate of 6,305 runs, average 33, for the four tours included a dozen centuries. Most successful in  1899, he made 1,941 runs, including five centuries, average 41.29. At Cambridge after a tie -- 436 on the first innings - he and Worrall hit off 124, the last 74 runs coming in twenty-eight minutes."", 'His side won the rubbers in  1899 and 1902, the second of these series being memorable for the tense finishes at Old Trafford, where Australia won by two runs, and Kennington Oval, where England won by one wicket. Under P. F. Warner, England regained The Ashes in the 1903 winter, and F. S. Jackson led England to a great triumph in 1905, when England were victorious in the only two finished games.', 'Jackson won the toss in each of those five Tests, and it was related that when they met again at the Scarborough Festival at the end of the tour,  Darling, with a towel round his waist, waited in the dressing-room, and received Jackson with the remark, ""I\'m not going to risk the toss this time except by wrestling"". But the spin of the coin again favoured Jackson, and he scored 123 and 31 not out in a match unfinished because of rain.', 'By a remarkable coincidence Sir Stanley Jackson and Joseph Darling were born on the same day, November 21, 1870. So Darling passed on at the age of 75.', 'In 1908  Darling left Adelaide and settled in Tasmania as a farmer, and continued making many runs in club cricket until well over fifty. He became a member of the Legislative Assembly, being awarded the C.B.E. in 1938. So he followed the example of his father, the Hon. J.

It climaxed with 1381 Pura Cup runs - an all-time, all-comers record until eclipsed by Michael Bevan the following season - and his inclusion among Australia\'s 25 contracted players. Given a chance against Sri Lanka at Darwin that winter, he managed 1 and 0 and again slipped down the pecking order to finish with 21 Tests and a largely unfulfilled career. His entry in 1996-97 was startling and in his second Test, when not out on 78, he ploughed straight into Mark Waugh and mangled his knee. Two precocious, hook-laden centuries at Lord\'s and Headingley eased the pain, earmarking him as a surefooted, elegant yet powerful driver. Within two years he was on the sidelines again - this time, seemingly, for good. A naturally reserved character, the touring treadmill grated and he is rumoured to have had trouble fitting in with the dressing-room culture. Significantly, during his 2003-04 renaissance, he frequently led the Pura Cup-winning Victorians into their victory song. He put his success down to better relaxation and know-how. ""I\'ve sort of scunged a few runs,"" he said - enough, in fact, for him to be judged Pura Cup Player of the Year for a record third time. After 12 seasons with Victoria he lost motivation and fought a bitter battle for a move to South Australia as a player-coach at the end of 2004-05, succeeding only after winning a grievance tribunal appeal. His first year with the Redbacks was not happy either, a knee injury cutting into a season that finished with returns well below his lofty expectations. He was axed from the Pura Cup side in his second season at South Australia after a disastrous campaign that featured 193 runs at 13.78 from seven games, but his one-day form was superb.

April 28, 1908, Waverley, Sydney, New South Wales ","November 22, 1981, St Leonards, Sydney, New South Wales (aged 73 years 208 days) ",,"['Australia,', 'New South Wales']",,,,,Right-hand bat,,Commentator,,,"['\n', ' ', ""\nJohn Henry Webb Fingleton (Jack) died on November 22, 1981 at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney. He was 73. Born at Waverley in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs,  Fingleton was educated firstly by the Christian Brothers at St Francis's School, Paddington, and then at Waverley College. Leaving school at the age of fifteen, he embarked on a career as a journalist which commenced with a cadetship at the Sydney Daily Guardian. Later, he was to move to the Telegraph Pictorial where he worked for several years prior to the Second War. At the outbreak of war, he joined the Army before being seconded to the former Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, as Press Secretary. From this time onwards, he lived and worked in Canberra.  Fingleton achieved no particular distinction on the cricket field while at school, but, on joining Waverley, he quickly graduated to the first eleven of a club which included  Kippax,  Carter,  Hendry and  Mailey within its ranks. A right-hand opening batsman,  Fingleton was noted more for his stubborn defence than for his aggression. The one epithet unfailingly used to describe his batting was  courageous. He was also an outstandingly gifted fieldsman, whose reputation was made in the covers but who was later to win fame with Vic Richardson, and sometimes with  W. A. Brown, in  South Africa in  1935-36 as part of the O'Reilly leg-trap. Neville Cardus, for whom Jack had the greatest regard, once described the Fingleton-Brown combination as  crouching low and acquisitively, each with as many arms as an Indian God. \n"", 'In  1930, when 22,  Fingleton won his first cap for  New South Wales and within twelve months (after only five first-class matches) he was selected for  Australia. In the home series against  South Africa in  1931-32, he was thrice twelfth man and he eventually won his place in the side for the final Test only because  Ponsford was forced out of the selected side by illness. In a game notable for its low scoring  Fingleton was second top-scorer with 40. In the following summer came the  Body-line series. Early in the season,  Fingleton scored a brave century for  New South Wales against the Englishmen, which was sufficient to ensure his selection for the  First Test. He started the series in fine form, with scores of 26, 40 and 83, and seemed as well equipped as any to handle the novel tactics of the opposition. However, the  Third Test at  Adelaide was a disaster for  Fingleton.  Australia were beaten by 338 runs,  Fingleton made a  pair, and he was blamed for leaking to the newspapers details of the exchange between Woodfull and  Warner which took place in the Australian dressing-room and almost led to the abandonment of the Test series. Perhaps as a repercussion,  Fingleton was a surprise omission from the Australian side selected to tour  England in  1934.', ""He was restored to the Test team for the tour of  South Africa in  1935-36, a tour that was to mark the apogee of his career. Against  Natal at  Durban he scored 167 (the highest innings of his first-class career), during the tour he had several mammoth opening partnerships with  Brown, and he concluded the series with centuries in each of the last three Test matches - 112 at  Cape Town, 108 at  Johannesburg and 118 in  Durban.  Australia won each of these games by an innings. In the following season in  Australia, against an  MCC side captained by  G. O. Allen, he created history by scoring a fourth consecutive Test hundred at  Brisbane. The achievement was later equalled by Alan Melville (whose four consecutive Test hundreds were scored between 1939 and 1947) and then surpassed by the West Indian, Everton Weekes (1948-49). In the  1936-37 series,  Fingleton achieved another place in the record book by sharing with  Bradman, in the  Third Test in  Melbourne, a sixth-wicket partnership of 346, a record which still stands. In  1938,  Fingleton was selected in the Australian team which toured  England, a Test series in which he had only moderate success. This, he was later to say, was  because I couldn't play the pull shot, I was never suited to English pitches. His Test career ended at  The Oval in  Hutton's Match. For  Fingleton it was a disappointing end: in the course of  England's marathon innings of 903 for seven declared he sustained a leg injury which was sufficiently serious to prevent him from batting in either Australian innings."", ""After the Second War  Fingleton retired from first-class cricket and divided his time between Canberra, where for 34 years until his retirement in 1978 he was political correspondent for Radio Australia, and the coverage of Test matches. In Canberra he was a close friend of several Prime Ministers. Typical of these relationships was that which he enjoyed with Sir Robert Menzies, who provided him with a handsome and laudatory foreword in his book, Masters of Cricket.  Fingleton's coverage of Tests resulted in publication of a number of books which secured for the writer a place at the forefront of Australian cricket writers. The books included Cricket Crisis (which involved itself principally with the Body-line series of 1932-33), Brightly Fades the Don (England 1948) Brown & Company: The Tour in Australia (Australia 1950-51), The Ashes Crown the Year (England 1953), Masters of Cricket, Four Chukkas to Australia (Australia 1958-59), The Greatest Test of All (Brisbane 1960), Fingleton on Cricket and The Immortal Victor Trumper. His final book - Batting From Memory - was to have been launched in Australia during the week of his death. In addition to his writing,  Fingleton was a witty, good-humoured and perceptive commentator for the BBC and at various times a contributor to "", ', ', ', ', ', and various newspapers in Australia, South Africa and elsewhere. In 1976, he was appointed OBE for services  to journalism and to cricket.\n']",[],18.0,29,1,1189.0,136,42.46,,,5,3,,1,13,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,108.0,166,13,6816,167,44.54,,,22,31,,,81,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,108.0,,91,54,2,1/6,,27.00,3.56,45.5,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

If they let him, he would bat for a week without becoming bored. ', ""Having grown up as a specialist opener, he has spent most of his time in the middle order with Australia and hasn't complained.

By his retirement after the 1969-70 season he had played 258 innings for his adopted State, making an unrivalled 9656 runs, mostly at an urgent rate, averaging 38.17, with 23 centuries. In all first class cricket his tally was 12,379 (36.62) with 27 centuries, one of them for Australia, an exercise in self-denial in the Madras Test of Jan 1960, during a tour which cost him two stone in weight. That, his finest innings, was played with a new upright stance, on a pitch sprinkled with sawdust.

Yet his international career was eventful and rewarding in that he began with 23 against England in an Australian innings of 601 for 8 dec at Brisbane which led to an innings victory, hit the runs which won back the Ashes at Adelaide four years later, had a fine double of 72 and 53 in Barbados in 1955 (the Atkinson/ Depeiza Test) having hit his first two balls of the tour - in Trinidad- for six and four, and took part in the tied Test and Brisbane in 1960, when he was run out after hitting Valentine's previous two balls for six. He also toured South Africa, without playing in a Test, and twice toured New Zealand, leading the side in 1966-67.

And while his antics sometimes overshadowed his bowling, Hughes gave every ounce of effort to his country, and helped it to re-climb the ranks of Test cricket. Hughes made a comparatively modest entrance in the mid-1980s, but his value came to the fore against West Indies in 1988-89, when he lost pace partner Geoff Lawson to a broken jaw in the second Test.

His analysis, 23.2 overs, 14 maidens, 28 runs, 10 wickets, indicates this exceptional performance as being quite out of the ordinary, no matter what the state of the pitch. As the natural effect of this achievement, Howell, after being left out of the first two engagements, became a regular member of the side. He did little in the five tests, taking only eight wickets at 43 runs apiece, but if unable to live up to such a start, Howell for the whole season came out with a record of 117 wickets at 20.35 apiece, his average placing him between Hugh Trumble and Ernest Jones, who each dismissed more batsmen. \n"", 'Visiting England with the next two Australian, Howell took fewer wickets but at smaller cost--68 for 17.86 each and 79 for 19.34 each.', 'He began test cricket by bowling A. C. MacLaren in both the Adelaide matches in the season of 1898-99, when the Lancashire amateur averaged 54. Altogether Howell appeared on sixteen occasions for Australia without accomplishing anything exceptional, though bowling wonderfully well at Melbourne in 1904. At a time when the Australian attack was very strong, his Test record showed 35 wickets at an average cost of 35.57. For New South Wales in Sheffield Shield matches he claimed 159 wickets, Average 23.55.', ""Of good height and heavily built, Howell made full use of his strong wrist and fingers in spinning the ball at medium pace. Usually, command of length gave him special ability, and he was deadly against batsmen unaware that his simple-looking delivery imparted unexpected life from the pitch. Howell showed this merit for New South Wales in November 1894, when he clean bowled five of A. E. Stoddart's team, including the captain and J. T. Brown, the Yorkshireman, while yielding only 44 runs--a happy introduction to his experiences against English cricketers."", ""A left-handed batsman, he sometimes startled the bowlers and the crowd by tremendous hitting. A notable case was at Sydney against Stoddart's team in 1898. Going in last for New South Wales, he hit up 48 in three-quarters of an hour and eclipsed this in the second innings with 95 in less than an hour, 76 of these runs coming in boundaries.

Mobile, sometimes acrobatic, and a perceptive judge of batsmen\'s weaknesses, his presence was for many years talismanic: Australia did not lose a series during his tenure. Grout claimed a record six catches in an innings on Test debut, and in February 1960 scooped a first-class record eight in an innings for Queensland against Western Australia. He was also a batsman good enough to score a Test half-century as an emergency opener batsman, and a humorist with a touch of Australian comedian Lennie Lower. Asked by an Englishman if he\'d attended a public school, he replied: ""Eton. And drinkin\'."" He ignored doctor\'s warnings about his weak heart and kept on playing until he was 39 - and died from a heart attack less than three years later.\n', ' \n', '\nArthur Theodore Wallace ""Wally"" Grout, who died in hospital in Brisbane on November 9, aged 41, kept wicket for Australia in 51 Test matches between 1957 and 1965. He entered hospital only two days before his death. A Brisbane doctor was afterwards reported as saying that Grout knew that he might collapse at any time during the last four years of his Test career and that he took part in the Australian tour of the West Indies only a few months after a heart attack in 1964. Yet Wally\'s unfailingly cheerful demeanour gave no inkling that there might be anything amiss with him.', ""Few chances escaped the agile Grout behind the stumps. In Test cricket he dismissed 187 batsmen, 163 of them caught and 24 stumped. Of these, 23 fell to him in the series with the West Indies in Australia in 1960-61; 21 in England in 1961 and 20 against England in Australia in 1958-59. Only T. G. Evans, who played in 40 more Test matches for England, possesses a better record. On two occasions Grout claimed eight victims in a Test match and his six catches in one innings against South Africa at Johannesburg in 1957-58 set up a world's record which has since been equalled by J. D. Lindsay for South Africa and J. T. Murray for England. On five other occasions Grout disposed of five batsmen in an innings. Outside Test cricket, his greatest achievement was when he exceeded all previous wicket-keeping feats in first-class cricket; for Queensland in the Sheffield Shield match at Brisbane in 1960, he sent back eight Western Australia batsmen, all caught, in one innings. That world's record still stands."", 'In addition to his wicket-keeping ability, Grout was also a distinctly useful late-order batsman, as he proved in that Test at Johannesburg in which he brought off his six catches. He and R. Benaud, in adding 89, set up a new record for the Australian eighth wicket against South Africa.', 'Tributes to Grout included:', ' (M.C.C.

It mesmerised me. Mum sent me weekly for sugar or potatoes or something else that in the early 1950s used to be weighed from bulk bins and did not come prewrapped in plastic. There on the wall, curling at the corners, was the poster - or it may have been a calendar - the multiple photographs of a wizened little man pointing his wrist towards the camera, holding a cricket ball this way and that,\nalways with a sly grin, always with his large cap pressed down over his creased-up eyes. He was Clarrie Grimmett, long abandoned by the first-class game but still, by the suggestion of craft and mystique, capable of sending a youngster running back from the shop to grab a tennis ball and send it spinning haphazardly all over the empty, dusty street. \n', ""Grimmett's influence on the thousands who watched him and later read about him was profound and secure for all time, especially in days of spin drought. Now, slow wrist bowlers are a threatened species. Then, Grimmett was one of many - but unmatched in skill and temperament. He became, quite simply, a legend, and unlike Arthur Mailey, who spun with gay abandon, he would have prospered today, given that selectors and captains did the right thing by him. He was wonderfully accurate because he was endowed with that special physical co-ordination that not even endless practice can turn into international class. It so happened that he did also practise endlessly."", 'Bowling to a marked area in his backyard, with a fox terrier to fetch the ball (and who apparently could also count to six), he made himself as accurate as a machine, and he mastered the variations of spin bowling, never believing that he knew it all. After the standard legbreak, topspinner and googly there came the flipper - which took several years to perfect, and which, when batsmen tried to discern by the snap of his fingers, he smokescreened by snapping the fingers of his left hand as he released a legbreak - and beyond that, well on in years, further experimentation: truly the Barnes Wallis of the cricket world.', ""He was as representative of Australia and her cricket as was Chips Rafferty of the men of the bush. Yet Grimmett was born in New Zealand. He spun his way into the world on Christmas Day 1891 (confessing to me in a letter in 1972 that it was a year earlier than shown in cricket records). Practising assiduously at the Basin Reserve, he first attracted attention at fifteen when he took 6 for 5 and 8 for 1 for Wellington Schools in a representative match; he was playing Plunket Shield at seventeen. He was named as emergency for Reese's side which toured Australia in 1913-14, but no SOS came. So he decided to try his luck alone, and crossed the Tasman the year the Kaisers War broke out. There followed\nthree happy years of club cricket in Sydney."", ""During this period he was once stopped in his tracks by M.A. Noble, his captain. 'D'you think you're the only one playing in this game?' said the great man. Clarrie was taken aback. He asked how he had offended. 'Don't you know there is a bowler on at the other end?' pursued Noble. 'Yes,' said Clarrie, 'but what's that to do with me?' He was told that the fast bowler at the other end hardly had time to put his sweater on before he had to take it off again. The little chap was taking 1 1/2 minutes to bowl a six-ball over. He was instructed henceforth to wait down the pitch and to walk back more slowly to his mark. How proud Noble would be today to see the doctrine so widely accepted."", ""Grimmett, a signwriter by trade, followed the signposts to Melbourne next, where former Test bowler J. V. Saunders gave him sound guidance. Soon he managed to find a place in the Sheffield Shield side. But the glow of his future shone from Adelaide, even though he finished with an 8 for 81 for Victoria. In February 1925, at 33, he won the first of his 37 Test caps. In that Sydney Test his figures were 5 for 45 and 6 for 37, his victims including Hobbs, Sandham, Woolley, Hendren, Hearne, Whysall and Kilner. Woolley, with a crowd of 40,000 looking on, was his first Test wicket, bowled by a 'wrong'un'. Eleven years later at Durban, van der Merwe was his 216th and last, in a Test in which he took 13 wickets. He was a very unlucky man not to have been given further international appearances."", ""As it was, he averaged exactly six wickets per Test (he didn't bowl in the Melbourne Test against South Africa in February 1932), with a striking rate of a wicket every 67 balls and an average cost of a mere 2.16 runs per six-ball over. There were some great batsmen around in those days, and some heartbreaking (for bowlers) pitches. Grimmett's rewards were earned by canniness and hard work. Often enough he got Hammond and Bradman out, and never did he bowl mechanically. The straight or barely-breaking ball was a main weapon, gaining him a high proportion of lbws. When the wicket was unresponsive he roundarmed to a teasing length, often at the leg stump; he could use looping, swerving flight quite as cleverly as 'Tich' Freeman, dropping the ball two feet short of the batsman's expectation; he closely analysed the opposition man by man, as if he were a demolition contractor, though their downfall he executed by guile, not violence."", ""His 29 wickets in England in the 1930 series were a record, and it is accepted that his bowling was at least as important to Australia as was Bradman's phenomenal batting (he took 144 wickets at 16.85 on the tour). In each of the next two home series - against West Indies and South Africa - he gathered 33 wickets. Highly effective in England again in 1934, he took 25 more (O'Reilly 28), and in 1935-36 he set a record for Australia which still stands of 44 wickets against South Africa. He crowned his career with his 200th Test wicket in that sensational rubber, the first bowler to do so, but at 44 he was considered by some to be too old for further service. He himself had always been conscious of his weight of years; indeed, he and his cricket cap were almost inseparable, lest his baldness be taken too seriously (shades of Arthur\nShrewsbury)."", ""He was aggrieved at being shelved, and the premature breaking-up of the\ndestructive spin partnership of Grimmett and O'Reilly almost certainly weakened\nAustralia in the few seasons remaining before the war. But still there was Sheffield Shield cricket, and in 1939-40 Clarrie showed 'em with 73 first-class wickets, lifting his Shield total to a record 513. So he was still very functional at 48."", 'He was also very affable almost forty years later, when, at the Centenary Test in Melbourne, where he made one of his last public appearances, moving very slowly, bent over his walking stick, the fragile old hero remembered his 10 for 37 against Yorkshire in 1930, still one of only three all-tens by Australians in England (the others were spinners too: Bill Howell and Arthur Mailey). Hallowed still in his memory was the strokeplay of Stan McCabe.', 'He thought deeply about the game all his life, and wrote one of the finest of\ncoaching manuals in ', "", which should be reissued and distributed to every school and club in these monotonous times of pace, pace and more pace. Towards the end, Clarrie Grimmett was touched by despair at the dearth of spin bowling. Ever ready to pass on advice, he hated to see the art at which he had been a master gradually fading to obscurity. In 1930 he met B. J. T. Bosanquet, who brought the googly to prominence and acceptability. 'Am I responsible for you?' the inventor said kindly to his Antipodean successor. The dynasty of wrist-spin seems to have lasted no more than three-quarters of a century."", ""He had more than the average share of nicknames, marks of respect and affection:\n'Scarlet', 'Grum', 'The Gnome', 'The Fox'. He was the 'miser' against Mailey's\n'millionaire', but there was nothing mean about Grimmett, except that he bowled a strict length, and was only once in his life called for a no-ball."", ""The corner shop's closed now, the poster disappeared years ago, and Grimmett is no more. His old team-mates Bradman, Pellew, O'Reilly, Darling and Fingleton were at his funeral. No moderns. Luckily I've got one of those pre-war\n'flicker' books, and I can see The Fox bowl his googly - six times in 1 1/2 minutes if the timing is right. Might take it to the Test matches this summer and flick it through as the fast bowlers tramp back to their marks."", 'Sufficient to say that cricket owes a mighty debt to the schoolmaster in New\nZealand who forbade the infant Grimmett to bowl fast and instead insisted that he develop his spinners.\n', '\nBorn in Dunedin in the South Island of New Zealand on Christmas Day,  Clarence Victor Grimmett must have been the best Christmas present Australia ever received from that country. Going to Australia in 1914, on a  short working holiday which lasted for 66 years, he joined the Sydney club, which had its headquarters at Rushcutters Bay. Three years in Sydney District cricket were sufficient to warn him that Arthur Mailey, another great spinner, had literally been given the green light towards the  New South Wales team and all fields beyond. This, and marriage to a Victorian girl, took  Grimmett to  Melbourne, where he played with the South Melbourne club. During his six years in Melbourne he was given only three invitations to play for  Victoria, the third of which was against  South Australia when, providentially, he collected eight wickets.', ""It was after his visit to Sydney with the Victorians, for the first Shield match after the Great War, that I managed to see him for the first time. In Sydney, in the match against  New South Wales,  Ted McDonald had performed outstandingly for  Victoria and was consequently the cynosure of all eyes when the Victorian team, on its way home to Melbourne, played an up-country match in the mountain city of Goulburn. Not quite all eyes, however. The attention of one pair, belonging to a thirteen-year-old boy named  O'Reilly, was rivetted on a wiry little leg-spinner whose name on the local score-board was  Grummett. To me, from that day onward,  Grummett he remained, and my own endearing name for him throughout our later long association was  Grum."", ""We played together for the first time in an  Australian team at  Adelaide against Herbie Cameron's  South Africans in  1931, and for the last time in the Durban Test of 1936 when Vic Richardson's Australian side became the first ever to go through a tour undefeated - a feat paralleled by Bradman's 1948 team in  England. On that 1935-36 South African tour,  Grum set an Australian record for a Test series with 44 wickets, yet he came home to be dropped forever from the Australian side. He was shoved aside like a worn-out boot for each of the five Tests against Gubby Allen's English team in  Australia in  1936-37 and he failed to gain a place in the 1938 team to  England, led by Bradman."", ""It was illogical to assume that age was the reason for his discard. He was 47, it is true, when the touring side was chosen, yet two years later, at the age of 49, he established an Australian record of 73 wickets for a domestic first-class season. Which raises, rather pointedly, the question of  why the hell was he dropped? By now  Don Bradman was  Grimmett's captain for  South Australia, and also  Australia's captain. As such he was an Australian selector, and Bradman, it seemed, had become inordinately impressed with the spin ability of  Frank Ward, a former clubmate of his in Sydney. It was  Ward who was chosen for the first three Tests against Allen's side in  1936-37 and who caught the boat for England in 1938. Bradman, it seemed had lost faith in the best spin bowler the world has seen.  Grum's departure was a punishing blow to me and to my plans of attack. His diagnostic type of probing spin buttressed my own methods to such a degree that my reaction to his dismissal was one of infinite loss and loneliness."", ""Unlike Arthur Mailey, the first of the Australian spin trilogy of the inter-wars era,  Grimmett never insisted on spin as his chief means of destruction. To him it was no more than an important adjunct to unerring length and tantalising direction.  Grimmett seldom beat a batsman by spin alone. Mailey often did. I cannot remember  Grimmett bowling a long-hop, whereas Mailey averaged one an over. So much, in fact, did inaccuracy become a feature of Mailey's success that he himself came to believe that it was an essential ingredient. Such wantonness was anathema to  Grimmett, who believed that a bowler should bowl as well as he possibly could every time he turned his arm over. And  Grimmett was perhaps the best and most consistently active cricket thinker I ever met."", ""He loved to tell his listeners that it was he who taught Stan McCabe how to use his left hand correctly on the bat handle - and I never heard Stan deny it. The  flipper was originated by  Grum during that Babylonian Captivity of his, and he used it to good effect in his record-breaking last season before the Second World War. He passed it on to men like Bruce Dooland and Cecil Pepper. He seldom bowled the  wrong'un, because he preferred not to toss the ball high. On hard, true pitches he would bowl faster than his usual pace, taunting good batsmen to get to him on the half-volley. He was a genius on direction, and his talent for preying on a batsman's weakness was unequalled. He never let a batsman off the hook; once you were under his spell you were there to stay."", ""Grimmett joined  South Australia from  Victoria in 1923, just in time to bowl his way into the final Test in Sydney against Arthur Gilligan's 1924-25  England team. In his baptismal effort he took eleven wickets. In 79 Sheffield Shield games he tallied 513 wickets, an Australian record that will probably last for ever. The most successful Shield spinner in modern times,  Richie Benaud, totalled 266 wickets in 73 matches, a relatively insignificant performance. Of  Grimmett's 106 Test wickets against  England, nearly 70 were collected on English pitches in a land where savants say leg-spinners are ineffective. One wonders what colossal figures he would have amassed had he played all his first-class cricket in  England. Had he done so, you can be sure there would not be half the present insistence on pacier finger-cutting."", ""It was lucky for me that I preferred to bowl downwind, an unusual trait in a spinner's character. It allowed our partnership to develop and prosper. No captain ever had to worry which bowling end was whose. We competed strongly with each other and kept a critical eye on one another's performances. In  Johannesburg in 1936, all-rounder  Chud Langton hit me clean over the top of the square-leg grandstand of the old  Wanderers ground. Cackling gleefully,  Grum left no doubt in my mind that it was the biggest hit he had ever seen. Silently I was inclined to agree. In  Clarrie's next over,  Chud clouted him straight over the sightscreen and so far into the railway marshalling yards that the ball was never returned. From that delivery, until hostilities ceased for the afternoon, I never managed to get within earshot of my bowling mate."", ""Social life meant little to  Grum. Not until late in his career did he discover that it was not a bad idea to relax between matches. In England in 1934 I bought him a beer in the Star Hotel in Worcester to celebrate his first ten wickets of the tour. It took him so long to sink it that I decided to wait for his return gesture till some other time on the tour. Later he told me, with obvious regret, that on previous tours he had been keeping the wrong company and had never really enjoyed a touring trip. That I thought was sad, but not half as sad as I felt when, at the very zenith of his glorious career, he was tipped out of business altogether. With  Grum at the other end, prepared to pick me up and dust me down, I feared no batsman. Our association must have been one of cricket's greatest success stories of the twentieth century.""]","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1931', 'Australian Cricket Hall of Fame 1996']",37.0,50,10,557.0,50,13.92,,,0,1,,2,17,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,248.0,321,54,4720,71*,17.67,,,0,12,,,140,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37.0,67,14513,5231,216.0,7/40,14/199,24.21,2.16,67.1,7,21,7,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,248.0,,73987,31737,1424,10/37,,22.28,2.57,51.9,,127,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He was a wristy right-hander, with exquisite footwork which compensated for his lack of inches (he was 5\'5"") and a New South Wales boy who marked Sydney\'s inaugural Test - when England were the visitors in 1894-95 - with a memorable 201, although the match is best remembered for England winning despite being forced to follow on. Gregory eventually led a depleted Australia in the Triangular Tournament in England in 1912, his last bow as a Test player.\n', ' \n', '\nSydney Edward Gregory, born on the site of the present cricket ground at Sydney, on April 14, 1870, died at Randwick, Sydney, on August 1, 1929, aged 59. It is given to few men to enjoy such a long and successful career in international cricket as that which fell to his lot, but he had cricket in his blood, for what the Graces and the Walkers were to the game in  England, the Gregory family, it could be urged, was to that in Australia. Twelve years after his uncle Dave had come to England, as captain of the pioneer side of 1878, S. E. Gregory paid his first visit here as a member of the 1890 team under W. L. Murdoch, and he was chosen for every side up to and including that of 1912. On his first two visits here he did not quite realize expectations as a batsman -- he completed his twentieth year on his way here in 1890 -- but he jumped to the top in the Australian season of 1894-95, and when in England in 1896 he batted brilliantly, scoring over 1,400 runs in all matches and coming out at the head of the averages. Altogether he played in fifty-two Test Matches for Australia, a larger number than any other Australian cricketer. In the course of these he made four three-figure scores and obtained 2,193 runs with an average of 25.80. He captained the Australian team of 1912 -- the year of the Triangular Tournament -- but had a somewhat thankless task in filling that office. Dissatisfied with the financial terms offered, several of the leading Australian cricketers refused to make the trip and the side, as finally constituted, included, in the regrettable circumstances, several players who had little claim to figure as representatives of the best in Australian cricket. He himself scored over a thousand runs but the team, although beating South Africa twice, had only a moderate record.', 'Pronounced and numerous as were his triumphs in batting, Sydney Gregory will probably be remembered more for what he accomplished as a fieldsman for, while several men have equalled and some have beaten his achievements as a run-getter, the cricket field has seen no more brilliant cover-point. Clever in anticipation and quick to move, he got to and stopped the hardest of hits, gathered the ball cleanly and returned it with deadly accuracy. His work, indeed, was always an inspiration to his colleagues and a joy to the spectators. Small of stature -- he was little more than 5 feet in height -- Gregory overcame this disadvantage in a batsman by splendid footwork. He possessed a very finished style, strong wrists and a keen eye. Particularly attractive in his strokes on the offside, he also, thanks to his quickness of movement, used to take balls off the middle stump with remarkable facility. The latter stroke, no doubt, cost him his wicket on many occasions but it brought him a lot of runs and, when successful, had a demoralising effect upon the bowler. He could stonewall when the situation called for those methods but his natural tendency was always to attack and, even when the ball turned a lot, his dashing game often knocked a bowler off his length. In short his cricket, both as batsman and fieldsman, suggested the bright and happy temperament which Sydney Gregory possessed in such full measure.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1897'],58.0,100,7,2282.0,201,24.53,,,4,8,,,25,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,369.0,587,55,15187,201,28.54,,,25,65,,,175,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58.0,3,30,33,0.0,-,-,35.33,6.60,-,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,369.0,,599,390,2,1/8,,195.00,3.90,299.5,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He was known mainly as a fearsome right-arm fast bowler but, also, in Test matches he scored 1146 runs, averaging 36.96 with two centuries. He batted left-handed and gloveless. \n', ""As a fast bowler, people of today who never saw him will get a fair idea of his presence and method if they have seen Wes Hall, the West Indian. Gregory, a giant of superb physique, ran some twenty yards to release the ball with a high step at gallop, then, at the moment of delivery, a huge leap, a great wave of energy breaking at the crest, and a follow-through nearly to the batsman's doorstep."", 'He lacked the silent rhythmic motion over the earth of EA (Ted) McDonald, his colleague in destruction. Gregory himself bowled as though against a gale of wind. It was as though he willed himself to bowl fast, at the risk of muscular dislocation. Alas, he did suffer physical dislocation, at Brisbane, in November 1928, putting an end to his active cricket when his age was thirty-three.', ""My earliest vivid impression of his fast bowling was at the beginning of the first game of the England v Australia rubber, at Trent Bridge, in 1921. The England XI had just returned from Australia after losing five Tests out of five (all played to a finish). Now, in 1921, England lost the first three encounters, taking long to recover from Gregory's onslaught at Trent Bridge."", 'He knocked out Ernest Tyldesley in the second innings with a bouncer which sped from cranium to stumps. Ernest\'s more famous brother JT had no sympathy; he bluntly told his brother, ""Get to the off side of the ball whenever you hook, then, if you miss it, it passes harmlessly over the left shoulder."" At Trent Bridge, that May morning in 1921, Patsy Hendren arrived with runs in plenty to his credit, largesse of runs in county matches. Gregory wrecked his wicket with an atom bomb of a breakback. Yes; it was a ball which came back by horrific velocity, not achieved, of course, by finger-spin, but by action.', ""Gregory, like Tom Richardson, perhaps the greatest of all fast bowlers ever, flung the upper part of his body over the front left leg to the off side as the arm came over, the fingers sweeping under the ball. Herbert Strudwick once told me that in the first over or two he took from Richardson he moved to the off side to take the ball. It broke back, shaving the leg stump, and went for four byes. Gregory, at Trent Bridge, took six wickets for 58, in England's first innings of 112; next innings McDonald took five for 52. Only once, at Lord's, in 1921, did Gregory recapture the Trent Bridge explosive rapture."", 'In the South African summer of 1921-22 he renewed his batteries and regained combustion. Next, in Australia 1924-25, he was able to take 22 wickets in the Tests against England at 37.09 runs each. But the giant was already casting a shadow; in 1926, in England, his three Test wickets cost him 298 runs. He was not a subtle fast bowler, with the beautiful changes of pace, nuance and rhythmical deceptions of Lindwall or McDonald (at his best). But as an announcement of young dynamic physical power and gusto for life and fast bowling, there has seldom been seen on any cricket field a cricketer as exciting as Jack Gregory.', ""In 1921 certain English critics made too much ungenerous palaver about Gregory's bouncers. These bouncers, no doubt, were awesome but not let loose with the regularity of, say, a Hall, a Griffith, not to mention other names, some playing today. In fact, no less an acute judge of the game as AC MacLaren declared, in 1921, that Gregory's bowling during the first deadly half hour at Trent Bridge was compact of half-volleys."", ""His baptism in English cricket was in 1919, with the Australian Imperial Forces team. He was already a menacing shattering fast bowler, but at Kennington Oval he was subjected to treatment such as he never afterwards had to suffer. Surrey faced a total of 436 and got into hopeless trouble. They wanted 287 to save the follow-on and five wickets went down for 26. Soon JN Crawford came in at No. 8 - a catastrophic moment - and he smote Goliath. He smote Gregory as any fast bowler has not often been smitten, except by Bradman and Dexter. Crawford actually drove a ball from Gregory that immortal afternoon at Kennington Oval, into the pavilion, cracking and splintering his bat. When Rushby, the last man, went in Surrey still required 45 to save the follow-on. Crawford went on hitting magnificently and they added 80 in thirty-five minutes, Rushby's share being a modest two. In some two hours Crawford scored 144 not out having hit two sixes and eighteen fours. And Gregory applauded him generously."", 'He was a generous and likeable Australian. He gave himself to cricket with enthusiasm and relish. He enjoyed himself and was the cause of enjoyment in others. At Johannesburg in 1921 Gregory scored a century in seventy minutes v South Africa - the fastest hundred in the history of Test cricket. He was a slip fielder of quite unfair reach and alacrity, a Wally Hammond in enlargement, so to say, though not as graceful, effortless, and terpsichorean.  Gregory was young manhood in excelsis.

Mr. Horan did not come in 1880, but two yeas later, with an aggregate of 1,175 and an average of 25, he ran second to WL Murdoch, for the ever-famous team that beat England by seven runs at the Oval. His highest innings that summer were 112 against the United Eleven at Chichester and 141 not out against Gloucestershire at Clifton. His career extended from the middle of the seventies to the late eighties. He enjoyed the distinction of being chosen for the memorable match at Melbourne in March, 1887, when, for the first time, an Australian side playing an English team on level terms proved victorious. Like Charles Bannerman he formed his method and earned high distinction as a batsman before enjoying the advantage of a trip to England. He had no special grace of style, but his defence was very strong, and he excelled against fast bowling. Even after an interval of nearly thirty-five years one recalls the masterly way in which he played Crossland at Liverpool in 1882, getting him away again and again on the leg side. Among his most notable innings at home were 124 for Australia against Alfred Shaw's First Team at Melbourne in 1882 and 117 not out for Victoria against Shaw's Third team at Melbourne in 1886.

During that tour he scored 1192 runs (average 25.91) and took 38 wickets (average 17.60). He made two other visits -- in 1905 and 1909 -- but in the latter tour did not show anything like such good ability in batting as when previously in England, his aggregate runs amounting to only 432. Altogether he took part in seventeen Test Matches, scoring 434 runs and taking twenty-one wickets. On one occasion he earned great distinction. In the second Test match at Lord's in 1902, when play was restricted to an hour and three-quarters on the opening day, Darling, to everyone's surprise chose Hopkins to open the bowling from the Pavilion end, although such capable men as Saunders,  Armstrong and Noble were there to share the attack with E Jones. As it happened, CB Fry made a wretched stroke to  short-leg and Ranjitsinhji was bowled off his pad, both these famous batsmen failing to get a run.

Not that he was a reactionary or relic; on the contrary, he was a savvy media performer and an innovative coach. But he had throughout his career a breezy confidence that recalled days when cricket was a more spontaneous and flamboyant affair. \n', ""It was while indulging in the oldest of Australia rites, the post-match drink, that Hookes was killed in circumstances still shocking in their senselessness, by a bouncer's gratuitous punch, on January 19, aged 48. Typically, he had been in the company of players both from his current state, Victoria, and his former state, South Australia, after an ING Cup game - a habit ingrained when he made his debut at Adelaide 28 years ago."", 'It was in his second season that Hookes, barely 21, first grabbed attention, harvesting five Sheffield Shield centuries from six innings, including centuries in both innings in consecutive games - a feat accomplished only once before, 70 years earlier, by Surrey\'s Tom Hayward. ""Heck!"" trumpeted Australia\'s Cricketer magazine. ""It\'s Hookes!"" Today, he might have had to prove his consistency over a longer course; then, he was at once slotted into Australia\'s middle-order for March 1977\'s Centenary Test with Greg Chappell and Doug Walters, where his five consecutive fours from Tony Greig\'s off-spin is among the most treasured cameos. ""I made Tony Greig famous,"" he once said drolly.', ""In that moment, too, Hookes became the face of Australia's cricket future. A blond, broad-shouldered, loose-limbed left-hander, Hookes was chased by the agents of Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket not merely for his cricketing gifts but his marketing potential. Despite having played but a single Test, he was advanced two-thirds of his fee rather than the half that others received: the new matinee needed a heart-throb."", ""Hookes's WSC years were contented ones: his 770 runs at 38.50 from a dozen SuperTests made him Australia's third-highest scorer after the Chappell brothers. He was also part of the enterprise's most dramatic moments when, after a testosterone-soaked assault on the bowling of Joel Garner and Michael Holding at the Sydney Showground, he had his jaw shattered by a bouncer from Andy Roberts in December 1977. Until that moment, WSC had looked suspiciously like a thrown-together entertainment package; Hookes' injury impressed the contest's intensity on all observers."", 'Hookes was in a prime position to secure a berth in Australia\'s middle-order when the WSC players were re-assimilated into official cricket in May 1979, but a knee injury and a calamitous tour of Pakistan where he scored 10 runs in six first-class innings queered his pitch. By December 1980, he was not even playing for South Australia. But, awarded the captaincy 10 months later, he led the state to a Sheffield Shield. ""I had to grow up,"" he explained, ""and I did.""', ""In one free-swinging summer, 1982-83, Hookes scored 1,424 runs at 64.72, which he followed with his only Test century, an unbeaten 143 in Australia's inaugural Test against Sri Lanka at Kandy. It was as good as the going got for Hookes at international level. He was back in state ranks by next summer following a miserable Australian performance at the World Cup, and after a last recall three years later was considered spent as an international force."", 'In truth, Hookes had always been a first-class destroyer of second-rate bowling - something about which he had few delusions. ""I have much to be modest about,"" he said at the start of his autobiography Hookesy. ""I suspect history will judge me harshly as a batsman because of my modest record in 23 Tests and I can\'t complain about that."" It was in Sheffield Shield cricket, and especially at the Adelaide Oval with its short square boundaries, that he was most destructive. He set records there for speed, as in his century from 34 balls against Victoria in October 1982, and scale, with an unbeaten 306 in an undefeated fourth-wicket stand of 462 with Wayne Phillips against Tasmania four years later.', 'Like his first skipper Ian Chappell, Hookes never courted officialdom, and was sacked as South Australia\'s skipper in August 1990 after eight seasons. Playing three more, he built his domestic run pile to a record 9,364. But by then he could see his future. He shrank from an administrative career - explaining ""I don\'t have a blue blazer and I haven\'t got dandruff"" - and gravitated towards radio which he tackled with both a sense of fun and spirit of commitment.', ""In September 1995, Hookes relocated to Melbourne, where his Sports Today on station 3AW with former Aussie Rules footballer Gerard Healy became required listening for aficionados. It was Hookes, for example, who in December 1998 foreshadowed the revelation that Shane Warne and Mark Waugh had accepted money from a bookmaker in Sri Lanka. Yet because Hookes was always impressively himself, the reckless abandon with which he sometimes expressed his views was often endearing: Warne, indeed, was among those who pressed for Hookes' appointment as Victoria's coach in May 2002."", ""Hookes tackled the task with impressive zeal, pensioning off experienced players like Damien Fleming and Colin Miller, and investing in youth and vitality. Victoria, last a domestic first-class title winner in 1990-91, led the Pura Cup and were second in the ING Cup at the time of Hookes' death.

The verdict on his Test career must be that it was deeply disappointing both to the player and the selectors, who kept faith with him for as long as they reasonably could. When he was summoned to the colours against England in February 1951, he seemed to have everything in his favour, not least his personal charm, good looks and grace of movement. He batted stylishly, could bowl offbreaks, and fielded in any position. He seemed to possess all the qualities needed for the captaincy of Australia. Hole was nineteen and playing for the St. George club in Sydney grade cricket when, in 1949-50, he was picked to represent New South Wales against Victoria in what was in effect the Sheffield Shield final. He managed only 23 and 6 with the bat, but taking six for 61 in the match he helped his side win by 196 runs. It was a useful début. That winter, he moved to Adelaide and became an automatic choice for South Australia until he retired in 1957-58. In 1950-51 he made 478 runs in the Shield for an average of 39.83, and in the state's two matches against MCC he batted well, without scoring heavily. Chosen for the final Test at Melbourne, when Australia had already somewhat fortuitously built up a 4-0 lead in the rubber, he made 63 in the second innings but could do little more than delay England's first victory since 1938. He also helped to make it slightly less emphatic by bowling Hutton for 79. In 1951-52, however, he suffered a considerable setback, scoring only 190 runs in nine innings against West Indies. He achieved little of note, apart from 45 not out in the second innings at Brisbane, when he remained imperturbable in a crisis, and 62 at Sydney in the final game, and his form in the Sheffield Shield, until he made a fine century against Queensland, was moderate. Next season, when the South Africans tested Australia to the full, drawing the series 2-2, he disappointed once again, the highest of some useful scores being a stylish 59 in the Fourth Test at Adelaide. Outside the Tests he fared better against the South Africans, with a well-made 97 for an Australian XIat Sydney and 102 for South Australia in Adelaide at the end of the tour. In the Sheffield Shield, helped by not outs, he averaged more than 80, and South Australia were winners for the first time since the Bradman era. \n"", ""By the time Hole toured England in 1953, the balance of power was swinging the home country's way, and they recovered the Ashes at The Oval at the end of a fascinating series in which runs were generally hard to come by. Tried as an opener at Trent Bridge, in those days the traditional venue for the First Test, he twice succumbed to Bedser, for 0 and 5. But at Lord's he made a useful 47 in Australia's second innings, as well as taking four catches in the slips, and at Old Trafford he helped Harvey put on 173 for the fourth wicket in Australia's first innings of 318. In the tense struggle which followed at Headingley, Hole was very much in action: he had scored 53 when he was brilliantly caught by Lock off Bedser in the first innings, and was 33 when, with Australia going for the runs, he was caught by Graveney from a hit which looked like carrying six over the square-leg boundary. After that, Australia were forced to give up the chase. At The Oval he played very well for 37 on the first day. Finishing with 273 runs for an average of 27.30, he was fourth in the Test averages behind Hassett, Morris and Harvey, and while he had certainly not lost ground, nor had he gained much. For the whole tour he made 1,118 runs at 33.87, as well as taking 22 catches. His bowling was rarely used."", ""Back at home in 1953-54 Hole made 670 runs for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield season which for once was not overshadowed by Test matches and a touring team. On Christmas Day 1953, against Queensland at Adelaide, he made 171 and then went on to 226, his only double-century. But the next summer, after an excellent 57 at Brisbane against Hutton's team, he was bowled three times in succession by Tyson at Sydney and Melbourne and was swept away in the wreckage of Australia's batting, never to be called upon again. His generous backlift, coupled with a long, lazy swing of the bat as he shaped his strokes, much have left him vulnerable to extreme speed. However, his failure to establish himself as a Test batsman was more one of temperament that technique. There were occasions when he came tantalisingly close to the breakthrough: one large score might well have done the trick. He had three more seasons for South Australia before being forced to retire when he ruptured his spleen taking an acrobatic catch off Dooland's bowling to dismiss Sam Loxton. In all first-class matches he made 5,647 runs for and average of 36.66, including eleven hundreds, and took 61 wickets at 44.03. His 82 catches were mostly at slip, where he became a specialist. In Test matches he scored 789 runs, average 25.45, and took three wickets at 42.00 apiece and 21 catches. He afterwards served the South Australian Cricket Association in several capacities.\n""]",[],18.0,33,2,789.0,66,25.45,,,0,6,,0,21,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,98.0,166,12,5647,226,36.66,,,11,31,,,82,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18.0,14,398,126,3.0,1/9,1/9,42.0,1.89,132.6,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,98.0,,6327,2686,61,5/109,,44.03,2.54,103.7,,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Born at Adelaide on March 18, 1877, the son of H. J. Hill, who scored the first century on Adelaide Oval, Clem Hill excelled his brothers -- all good at the game -- and when 16 he put together the remarkable score of 360 in an Inter-College match at Adelaide. This was the highest innings hit in Australia at that time,  1893, and young Clem Hill gave clear indication of the skill which matured without a check. \n', ""Soon after completing his 18th year he scored 150 not out for South Australia against A. E. Stoddart's team in 1895, and a year later, with Harry Trott as captain, he made the first of four visits to England. Third in the averages, he established himself as being worthy of a place in any eleven, and when next Stoddart took a side to Australia,  Hill exceeded the highest expectations by scoring 829 runs in twelve innings, his average of 75 far surpassing that of both K. S. Ranjitsinhji and A. C. MacLaren, the chief batsmen in the touring side. That season he scored 200 for  South Australia against the visiting team, and his 188 at  Melbourne in the fourth Test, when Australia began so badly as to lose six men for 57, was largely responsible for a victory by eight wickets. This innings was considered the finest that Clem Hill ever played."", ""Coming to England with the side under the captaincy of Joe Darling, another fine left-handed batsman, in 1899, he showed splendid form until taken ill early in July. He and Victor Trumper each scored 135 at Lord's, sharing the chief honours in beating  England by ten wickets, and so helping largely to win the rubber: for this was the only decisive result in the five Tests. He headed the averages for the tour with 60.20. To prove that even such a splendid batsman may fail it is interesting to recall that in the second innings of the  third Test at Leeds, the order of batting being altered, he fell the first victim of a hat-trick by J. T. Hearne; Hill was clean bowled, S. E. Gregory and M. A. Noble were both caught in the slips. From 1896 to 1912 he played in 49 Test matches, 41 against England, eight against South Africa; he captained Australia when South Africa were the visitors in  1910, and in the following season against the England touring side, led by J. W. H. T. Douglas owing to the illness of P. F. Warner."", ""As a rule Clem Hill, going in first wicket down, was at his best on the important occasion and in Test matches he scored 3,412 runs; average 39. He hit seven centuries against South Africa and four against England, besides 96, 99, 98 and 97. The innings of 98 and 97 were the highest scores for Australia at  Adelaide in January 1902 and, with Trumble's all-round work, brought about the defeat of England by four wickets. These displays followed his 99 which helped in a victory by 229 runs at Melbourne -- three consecutive scores just short of the century in Tests with England."", 'A specially brilliant batsman on hard pitches, Clem Hill scored 6,274 runs, average 52.28 in Sheffield Shield matches -- a record until beaten by Don Bradman. His highest innings was 365 not out for South Australia against New South Wales at  Adelaide in December 1900, his average that season being 103.33. In similar matches he made 206 not out at Sydney in 1895 and 205 at Adelaide in 1909.', ""While able to drive hard to the off or straight, usually with the ball kept down, Clem Hill scored chiefly on the leg side by skilful strokes perfectly timed and placed, the way in which he turned straight balls clear of fieldsmen being exceptional. Brilliant square and late cutting made Hill delightful to watch and in defence his style claimed admiration while his patience was unlimited. A splendid field particularly in the deep, Clem Hill brought off one catch that will never be forgotten by the spectators at the third Test match at  Old Trafford in 1902. When England wanted eight runs for victory with two wickets in hand Dick Lilley made a square-leg hit which looked like carrying the pavilion rails, but as Hill ran from long-on the wind seemed to check the force of the hit. The ball fell almost straight and Hill, racing across its flight, with outstretched hands, held it, so accepting a chance that few fieldsmen would have thought worth attempting. Australia won by three runs, and the victory, following success at Sheffield, where Hill scored 119, by far the highest innings in the match, gave them the rubber, a triumph to which Hill's amazing catch contributed to an unknown degree. Rain ruined the first two Tests and  England won the last by one wicket."", 'Two Australian Test match partnership records stand to his name -- 165 for the seventh wicket with H. Trumble at Melbourne in January  1897, and 243 for the eighth wicket with R. J. Hartigan at  Adelaide in January 1908. On that second occasion an attack of influenza prevented Hill from fielding, but he batted five hours twenty minutes for 160, and Australia, after being 78 behind on the first innings, won by 245 runs.\n']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1900', 'Australian Cricket Hall of Fame 2005']",49.0,89,2,3412.0,191,39.21,,,7,19,,,33,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,252.0,416,21,17213,365*,43.57,,,45,83,,,168,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,252.0,,510,323,10,2/6,,32.30,3.80,51.0,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Two years earlier, Hilfenhaus was earning money on a building site, but his ability to shape the ball away at 140kph earned a six-figure pay packet. ""It has been a fast ride,"" he said after picking up the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year prize in February 2007.

It was a rare treat for Gillespie, who played only 52 of a possible 92 Tests after his 1996-97 debut thanks to an assortment of ailments: busted feet, stress fractures in the back, hip twinges, side strains, dicky shoulders, torn calves, aching hamstrings, groin complaints and a broken right leg. Each time he recovered and until being dropped during the 2005 Ashes he had missed only two Tests since November 2002. Through it all, in partnership with Glenn McGrath, he blossomed into one half of Australia's most statistically successful opening pair ever. \nBut if McGrath's strength was his ability to make the ball do just enough, then Gillespie's flaw is his tendency for it to do too much. No other contemporary fast man has elicited so many plays-and-misses. It explains, perhaps, along with his slightly samey length, why Gillespie never quite imposed himself as Australia's No. 1 strike bowler. Nor has he truly dominated an opposition line-up; remarkably, the most wickets he has taken in a single series is 20. Operating from a shorter reconfigured run-up, he is not so consistently quick and in England Michael Vaughan treated Australia's fifth most successful bowler like a medium-pacer.  \n"", 'However, few Australian fast men can have owned such deep wells of tenacity. Gillespie bowls long spells in the hottest conditions - always uncomplainingly, and always with the seam upright and the ball jagging both ways - and he showed the trait again when he promised to return to the national team and memorably achieved his aim against Bangladesh. He collected eight wickets in the two-match series, taking his Test tally to 259 while McGrath, Kasprowicz and Tait were missing, but his unforgettable moment came over 574 minutes and 425 balls. His maiden century was a magnificent, unbeaten 201 that was easily the highest score by a nightwatchman. ', 'He is popular with team-mates and bashful with the public. He watches wrestling, listens to heavy metal and celebrated his first Test fifty with a bat ride embellished from the movie ', "". He was more restrained while clocking off unthinkable milestones at Chittagong and it was appropriate recognition for a hardy and valuable batting approach that has also produced two unbeaten half-centuries and a priceless 26, which sealed a hard-fought draw against India in 2004-05. A second first-class century came in 2007 at Yorkshire shortly before he retained his Cricket Australia contract. Throughout the previous home season he was certain he wouldn't be rewarded, but his 30 Pura Cup wickets at 28.43 helped him to sneak into the squad as experienced back-up, ending the idea of him moving states. With no chance of a recall, he announced his retirement from first-class cricket during the 2007-08 season and signed a three-year contract with the unofficial Indian Cricket League.

He was simultaneously a cheerful throwback to more innocent times, a flap-eared country boy who walked when given not out in a World Cup semi-final, and swatted his second ball for six while sitting on a Test pair. ""Just hit the ball,"" is how he once described his philosophy on batting, and he seldom strayed from it. Employing a high-on-the-handle grip, he poked good balls into gaps and throttled most others, invariably with head straight, wrists soft and balance sublime. Only at the death did he jettison the textbook, whirling his bat like a hammer-thrower, caring only for the scoreboard and never his average. Still he managed to score at a tempo - 81 per 100 balls in Tests, 96 in one-dayers - that made Viv Richards and Gilbert Jessop look like stick-in-the-muds.  \n', ""When he signed a record A$2m sponsorship deal with Puma in 2004, few people questioned his value for money. Indeed it was arguably Gilchrist's belated Test arrival that turned the Australian XI from powerful to overpowering. He bludgeoned 81 on debut, pouched five catches and a stumping, and barely paused for breath until stepping down in 2008. Only in the closing stages of an untouchable career did his appetite slow - he was troubled by Andrew Flintoff's around-the-wicket angle during 2005 and found the flaw difficult to overcome - and his match-turning 144 against Bangladesh in April 2006 was his first century in 16 Tests. "", ""The 2006-07 Ashes series was literally hit and miss, with three single-figure scores, two fifties and his most brutal hundred. At home his one-day form was subdued, but the game's biggest competition - and it's most important match - brought out Gilchrist's highest standards. He stole the World Cup final from Sri Lanka with 149 off 104 balls, slamming 13 fours and eight sixes, and added to his 54 and 57 from his previous two global triumphs. Using a tip from his batting coach Bob Meuleman, he put a squash ball in his glove to allow him to hit straighter - the advice should have been patented instantly. "", ""In Tests, three Gilchrist innings rank among the most amazing by Australians: his death-defying unbeaten 149 against Pakistan at Hobart when all seemed lost, his savage and emotional 204 not out against South Africa at Johannesburg, and his 57-delivery Ashes century at Perth when he missed equalling Richards' world mark by a ball. In one-dayers, his 172 is the third-highest score by an Australian and his 472 dismissals might take decades to top. "", ""As Australia's 41st Test captain he found the extra burden tiring, and was happy for Ricky Ponting to step in once Steve Waugh retired. But as Ponting's fill-in he crossed the final frontier, leading Australia to their first series win in India for 35 years in 2004-05. As a wicketkeeper he lacked Rod Marsh's acrobatics and Ian Healy's finesse, and he probably peaked at 30 in 2002. But if he clutched few screamers he dropped even fewer sitters, although one easy offering in Adelaide convinced him it was time to go. During that match against India he briefly became the leading gloveman in Test cricket by overtaking Mark Boucher, then the following day announced his retirement from all cricket but the Indian Premier League."", ' \n', ' September 2008']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year - 2002', 'One-Day International Player of the Year - 2003', 'One-Day International Player of the Year - 2004', 'Walter Lawrence Trophy 2010']",96.0,137,20,5570.0,204*,47.6,6796,81.95,17,26,677,100,379,37,287.0,279,11,9619.0,172,35.89,9922,96.94,16,55,1162,149,417.0,55.0,13.0,13,1,272.0,48,22.66,192,141.66,0,0,27,13,17.0,0.0,190.0,280,46,10334,204*,44.16,,,30,43,,,756,55,356.0,343,19,11326,172,34.95,,,18,63,,,526.0,65.0,102.0,102,5,2622,109*,27.03,1869,140.28,3,13,296,120,74.0,22.0,96.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,287.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,13.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,190.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,356.0,,12,10,0,-,-,-,5.00,-,0,0,0,102.0,1,1,0,1,1/0,1/0,0.00,0.00,1.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

March 27, 1859, Norwood, Adelaide, South Australia ","November 29, 1927, Parkside, Adelaide, South Australia (aged 68 years 247 days) ",,"['Australia,', 'South Australia']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"['\n', '\nGeorge Giffen, born in Adelaide on March 27, 1859, died in a private hospital at his native place, after a long illness, on November 29, aged 68, thus surviving his old comrade, J. J. Lyons, a few months only. As a batsman Giffen possessed a wonderfully fine defence. He stooped a little but had a great variety of strokes with great freedom in his use of the bat, and was exceptionally strong in driving. He bowled right-hand, rather below medium-pace, with considerable spin and well-concealed change of flight and pace. He used to send down with much effect a slow ball, very high-tossed, which, seeming to be coming well up to the batsman, pitched short, and resulted in many a  caught and bowled. It was expected that Giffen would have charge of the Australian team which toured England in 1886, but his merits as a leader were not commensurate with his merits as a player. Giffen first visited England in 1882 as a member of the team which beat England at the Oval by 7 runs. As the side included Spofforth, Boyle, Garrett, and Palmer--four of the finest bowlers of the time-- Giffen was overshadowed, and while they averaged l50 wickets at a cost of less than 13 runs each, he had to be content with taking thirty-two wickets for 22 runs each. Still, he had a brilliant success against the Gentlemen of England at the Oval, where he took eleven wickets for less than 10 runs each--eight in the first innings for 49 runs--and contributed largely to a memorable triumph. Nor had his batting powers at that period fully developed, but his record of 873 runs with an average of 18 was a vastly bigger thing than it would be regarded on the easy wickets of to-day. He showed a marked advance in 1884, and two years later, headed both batting and bowling averages, scoring 1,454 runs, for an average of 25, and taking 162 wickets for 16 runs each. Giffen declined invitation to join the Australian teams of 1888 and 1890, but was a member of the side captained by Blackham in 1893, and also of that led by Harry Trott in 1896. In these years, however, though he came out with a fair record for the whole of each tour, he accomplished little in the representative games. Giffen, indeed, in England scarcely reproduced his Australian form, which was of so high a class that he used to be referred to as the  W. G. Grace of Australia. As a member of the five teams mentioned he visited the United States three times, New Zealand twice, and Canada once, besides taking part in two small games in Ceylon. \n', 'His eighteen three-figure scores in first-class cricket--six in England and a dozen in his own country--were:', 'On three other occasions he obtained over 100 runs and more than ten wickets in a match, each time for South Australia:', ""He trained specially for the last mentioned game, being then within a week or two of completing his forty-fourth year. Most remarkable of all, perhaps, was his all-round performance in scoring 161 out of a total of 586, and 41 in a total of 166 for Australia v. Stoddart's team at Sydney in December, 1894, as in that match he also took eight wickets, and yet was on the losing side. The bowling of Peel and Briggs on a ruined pitch won the match for England by 10 runs. In the winter of 1883, at Sydney, for the fourth Australian team against the Rest of Australia, Giffen took all ten wickets in an innings for 66 runs. He had his greatest success as a bowler in England during the season of 1886, when sixteen Derbyshire wickets fell to him for 101 runs, and in five consecutive innings he dismissed forty batsmen at a cost of 222 runs. He did the  hat trick three times--for South Australia, against G. F. Vernon's team, at Adelaide, in 1887-88 against Lancashire, at Manchester, in 1884; and against an England eleven, at Wembley Park, in 1896. Altogether in first-class matches, Giffen scored 12,501 runs, at an average of 29, and took 1,109 wickets, at a cost of 21 runs each. In matches between Australia and England he made 1,238 runs, and took 103 wickets, In 1922-3 the match at Adelaide between South Australia and Victoria was played for his benefit, and the resulting sum, £2,020, was vested in trustees. After being a Civil Servant in the General Post Office at Adelaide for 43 years, he retired on pension in March, 1925, thereafter finding the chief delight of his life, whilst health permitted, in coaching young boys in a purely honorary capacity.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1894'],31.0,53,0,1238.0,161,23.35,,,1,6,,1,24,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,251.0,421,23,11758,271,29.54,,,18,53,,,194,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31.0,43,6391,2791,103.0,7/117,10/160,27.09,2.62,62.0,7,7,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,251.0,,46916,21785,1022,10/66,,21.31,2.78,45.9,,95,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He first played for Australia at Trent Bridge in 1921, several days after his 26th birthday, and between then and 1928-29 he played in eleven Tests without ever doing full justice to his natural all-round ability. He scored 335 runs with an average of 20.93 and took sixteen wickets at 40.00, but it needs saying that, given the strength of some of the Australian sides in which he appeared, he was almost surplus to requirements. Circumstances as much as any personal failing led to his disappointing Test match figures. \n', 'A 6ft 2in tall right-hand bat and fast-medium swing bowler, he went straight from Sydney Grammar School into first grade cricket, where his gangling build, especially his long legs, quickly earned him the sobriquet Stork from M. A. Noble, who as a young man had not been of such a different physique himself. Hendry made full use of his height, reaching into the drive or powerfully cutting and hooking the rising ball. His long arms made him an awkward bowler to judge, and he was an outstanding fielder. His combination with Gregory in the slips on the 1921 tour of England was described as beyond praise.', 'When Sheffield Shield cricket resumed in 1919-20, Hendry had already established a place in the New South Wales side and he played 38 times and hit three hundreds for the state before moving to Melbourne and taking up a position at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, succeeding Warwick Armstrong as pavilion clerk (ground secretary) of the Melbourne Cricket Club. In 1925-26, his second season for Victoria, he hit 325 not out in 323 minutes against the visiting New Zealanders, sharing partnerships of 204 in 118 minutes for the sixth wicket with Lansdown (51) and 110 in 63 minutes for the seventh with Liddicut (47) in a total of 592 for seven declared. This was easily the highest of his fourteen hundreds, ten of which were scored in Shield matches, and by way of coincidence it meant that his best batting and bowling performances were against New Zealand representative sides. In Wellington in 1923-24, he had taken eight for 33 for New South Wales as New Zealand were bowled out for 89 on a soft wicket.', ""Hendry's single hundred for Australia, 112, came at the end of his Test career, at Sydney in the Second Test of the 1928-29 series against England. He and Woodfull put on 215 for the second wicket and it is of interest perhaps that he was batting first wicket down, his preferred place in the order. So often for Australia he had to bat much lower. However, he did little at No. 3 in the next two Tests, when he also opened the bowling, and he was omitted from the side for the final Test. He had been unfortunate when he toured England a second time in 1926 to contract scarlet fever and miss all the Test matches, for his scores suggested good form. He began the tour with 71 against Essex and 68 against Surrey, and after his return to the team in August, having been ill since May, he hit 81 in 80 minutes against an England XI at Folkestone. His first-class career finished on a tour to India with Ryder's team for the Maharajah of Patiala in 1935-36. In his 140 matches between 1918-19 and then, he scored 6,799 runs at 37.56, took 229 wickets at 29.02 and held 151 catches.\n""]",[],11.0,18,2,335.0,112,20.93,,,1,0,27,0,10,0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,140.0,206,25,6799,325*,37.56,,,14,34,,,151,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,19,1706,640,16.0,3/36,3/41,40.0,2.25,106.6,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,140.0,,16601,6647,229,8/33,,29.02,2.40,72.4,,6,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

A very fine hard-wicket bowler, a capital field, and a punishing if not dependable batsman, he took part in the two matches against James Lillywhite's all-professional team in March and April 1877, after which he came to England with first Australian team in 1878, and also in 1882 and 1886. Thus he served under three different captains--David Gregory, W. L. Murdoch and H. J. H. Scott. When Australia in March 1877 won by 45 runs what years after was styled the first Test match he scored 19 not out and 0, and took two wickets for 81, while in the return, which Lillywhite's team won by four wickets, he scored 12 and 18 but earned no success with the ball. Really his first experience of meeting the full strength of England was in the historic 1882 encounter at the Oval where Australia won by seven runs, but his share in The Ashes triumph was small--12 runs for once out and one wicket for 32 runs. \n"", ""The 1878 team altogether played as touring side for fourteen months. Opening with a series of matches in Australia, they went through the season in England, then followed with a trip to America, while a second series of games in Australia concluded the enterprise before the side disbanded. The huge programme of seventy-seven engagements was gone through by practically eleven men, for Midwinter, who they hoped would assist them regularly in England, had signed an agreement with Gloucestershire, and, after appearing for the Australians on a few occasions, was carried off from Lord's to the Oval by W. G. Grace and J. A. Bush, and he did not take the field again as a member of the touring side. For that combination in England Garrett claimed 38 wickets for 10 runs apiece in eleven-a-side games--twenty of the fixtures were against odds. His record during the fourteen months in all matches showed 291 wickets for 5 runs each."", ""Four years later--1882--when contests with 18's and 22's no longer figured on the programme arranged for the Australians, Garrett took 128 wickets for under 14 runs apiece, and in 1886 his record was 123 wickets for something over 18 runs each. Possessed of a nice easy action, he made good use of his height--nearly six feet--and so came fast off the pitch. He bowled above medium-pace and under favourable conditions could turn the ball either way, while he sent down a very telling yorker, but got most of his wickets with the ball which pitched just outside the off-stump and went away slightly. On hard ground many good judges regarded him as more effective than Spofforth or Boyle."", ""In the 1878 tour he took ten Middlesex wickets at Lord's for 82 runs, and at Prince's he disposed of seven Players of England for 41 runs. Four years later among his best performances were seven Surrey wickets for 31 runs and twelve Kent wickets for 120, while in four matches which the Australians played with Yorkshire 27 wickets fell to him for 9 runs apiece. In 1886 his successes included seven wickets for 40 against Lord Sheffield's XI, seven for 47 in the first of two games with Gentlemen of England, seven for 84 against Yorkshire, and seven for 82 at Bradford against the Players. In nineteen matches for Australia against England he took 36 wickets and scored 340 runs."", ""During his three visits to England Garrett's highest innings was 59 against Northumberland in 1882; at Sydney in 1885 his 51 not out contributed largely to Australia beating England by six runs. In his 35th year, when the Sheffield Shield was instituted in 1892, he appeared for New South Wales in only seventeen competition matches, scoring 776 runs, highest innings 131, average 26.75 but taking only five wickets at the very high cost of 62 runs apiece."", 'Born at Woolongong, near Sydney, on July 26, 1858, Garrett was educated at Newington College, Sydney, and at Sydney University, where he earned distinction as a sprinter. A solicitor by profession, he held the position of Public Trustee in Sydney.

At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon.

But the observers who had seen something in Hazlewood were to be justified, as he statistically kept pace with McGrath, or near enough to it, during the early stages of his international career. Both men had made their Test debuts at 23 and Hazlewood reached 100 Test wickets in 46 innings, just one innings slower than his idol. Along the way, Hazlewood was only once dropped from the side: mentally and physically fatigued, he was left out of the fifth and final Ashes Test in England in 2015, despite a collection of 16 wickets at 25.75 in the series.

It enabled him to shrug off years of carping that he was technically too limited for Test cricket because of the way he played around his front pad, and it enabled him to touch rarefied heights of batsmanship. Before his maiden first-class innings, he asked if anyone had made 200 on debut, then went out and hit 149. The runs rarely abated over the next 17 years. Tall, powerful and equipped with concentration befitting the fisherman and surfer that he is, he battered the ball at and through the off side for days at a time. He has also made himself a fine catcher in the slips and gully.  \n"", ""Hayden's earliest Tests were exclusively against South Africa and West Indies, a trial for any opener. They were not auspicious, but patience and willpower won the day, especially after the tour of India in 2000-01, where he slog-swept his way to 549 runs, an Australian record for a three-Test series. By the end of 2001 he had broken Bob Simpson's Australian mark for most Test runs in a calendar year - Ricky Ponting first topped Hayden's 1391 in 2003 - and formed a prodigiously prolific opening partnership with Justin Langer. Belatedly he came good in the one-day arena too, and by the time the 2003 World Cup rolled around he was ranked among the top three batsmen in both forms of the game. Later that year he hammered 380 against Zimbabwe at Perth, briefly borrowing the Test record from Brian Lara, and in mid-2004 he was at it again, battering Sri Lanka for twin centuries that took his tally to 20 in only 55 Tests. "", ""Weary through years of plunder and a difficult India tour, Hayden experienced an extended slump during 2004-05 and was initially replaced as one-day opener by Michael Clarke. His lack of form and footwork continued against England and his disastrous series only improved at The Oval with 138. It was the awkward beginning of a resurgence that extended his career and thrust him towards more middle-aged domination. Usually playing more patiently, he followed his south London renaissance with three hundreds in successive matches, becoming the third player next to Bradman and Barrington to score four in a row twice, and passed 1000 runs in a calendar year for the fifth time. After reaching three figures on five occasions during 2005-06 and adding 153 at the MCG a year later, he stood behind only Bradman, Ponting and Waugh on Australia's list of century-makers. With three hundreds in consecutive games against India in 2007-08, he quickly leapfrogged Bradman's 29, and had 30 when he waved goodbye.\n \nRegaining the Ashes in 2006-07 brought tears to Hayden's eyes and he was also saddened when Langer retired at the end of the series, although his mood lifted when he won back his one-day place. In the final match of the 2006-07 Chappell-Hadlee series he thumped an Australian-record 181 off 166 balls, which included ten sixes, and showed his impressive power. More muscle was on display at the World Cup as he averaged 73.22 in scoring 659 runs, the most at the tournament, and he later revealed he was carrying a fractured toe "", ' a broken bone in his other foot. A frightening 66-ball century against South Africa earned him honorary St Kitts citizenship and the outdoors man completed a dream trip by scoring another two hundreds, hooking a 136kg marlin and winning the World Cup for a second time. ', ""A year later he was back in the Caribbean only briefly, returning home without playing a Test due to an Achilles injury suffered during training while on Indian Premier League duty. Australia's top order lost strength without him, just as it had when India ended the 16-match winning streak at the WACA. He had been keen to push on until the 2009 Ashes, but disappointing displays in the lost series against India and South Africa in 2008-09 prompted him to announce his retirement after the Sydney Test.

Built for work, he had an ungainly asymmetrical action, but moved the ball late, bowled a well-disguised slower ball, was seldom collared and never demoralised: his best innings figures (7 for 105) and match figures (10 for 115) both arose during heavy Australian defeats. Hawke was a first-rate Australian Rules footballer, and injuries from that sport handicapped him in the second half of his career, while in later years he suffered acutely from illness. He finally lost his 20-year battle against various ailments on Christmas Day, 2000. But his lust for cricket, and for life, emerges in his autobiography Bowled Over, one of the frankest Australian cricketing memoirs.\n', ' \n', 'Neil Hawke died on Christmas Day, 2000, aged 61, having been ill for more than 20 years. ""Hawkeye"" was a mainstay of the Australian attack in the 1960s and took 91 wickets in 27 Tests. ""He was a strapping medium-pacer,"" wrote Gideon Haigh, ""with an un-aesthetic, asymmetrical action but a fine follow-through conducive to late movement."" His stamina (built up by playing Australian Rules) and his uncomplaining good nature were vital to a team that, in his time, often had to scrap for any advantage. Hawke\'s best Test figures - seven for 105 - came at Sydney in 1965-66 when he bowled defiantly with the second new ball after England had touched 303 for one. Even so, he could not prevent an innings defeat. Nine months earlier, he had achieved match figures of ten for 115 in another losing cause at Georgetown. In England he is best remembered for yet another negative reason: as Fred Trueman\'s 300th Test victim at The Oval in 1964. However, Hawke had a more decisive role in that series. Batting at No. 9, he put on 105 with Peter Burge to transform the Headingley Test after Ted Dexter had controversially withdrawn the spinners and taken the new ball. Hawke had already collected five for 75 in the first innings, and Australia went on to win the only decided game of the series. He took 18 wickets in the five Tests, second only to Graham McKenzie, and 83 on the tour at 19.80. He was far less successful in 1968 and dropped after Lord\'s. Hawke remained a heroic figure in South Australia, where he was born - he also played briefly for Western Australia and Tasmania, and for seven years in the Lancashire League - and became an even greater icon after 1980, when he was infected following an operation and became so ill that he needed 30 operations in two years. For the rest of his life he suffered regular relapses, but his response was inspirational: as his wife, Beverley, put it, ""He fought back from the brink of death time after time.""

Hauritz gained an unlikely second chance at international level in 2008-09, but quickly grew into an offspinner who could mix attack and defence successfully. He really showed his value last summer when he took 18 wickets in three Tests against Pakistan batsmen who usually cause severe damage to slow bowlers.  \n"", ""The haul followed 11 breakthroughs against West Indies and 10 in the opening three Tests of the 2009 Ashes series, when he started strongly but was left out for the final two matches. While a heel injury stopped him from being part of the series against Pakistan in England, he remains a key part of Australia's medium-term plans. During the past two years he also became a regular contributor in the one-day team, although he is less fancied as a Twenty20 operator."", ""Hauritz surprised himself with his season in 2008-09 as he leapfrogged a host of fringe spinners to finish the season as the only specialist slow bowler with a Cricket Australia contract. It was a stunning turnaround for an offie who was cut loose following his first Test in 2004. Having watched Beau Casson, Jason Krejza, Cameron White and Bryce McGain take preference following Stuart MacGill's retirement in 2008, Hauritz was picked for the second Test against New Zealand in Adelaide despite not playing for New South Wales the previous week. In three matches at home he took nine wickets and appeared in his first ODI for six years, but was kept in the dressing room for the Tests in South Africa. After four breakthroughs in the opening one-dayer against the Proteas, he was chosen in every 50-over contest over two series, leading Australia's wicket-takers in the United Arab Emirates. "", ""Hauritz, an Australian Under-19 captain, made his ODI debut at 20 and was a surprise selection for the Test tour of India ahead of MacGill in 2004. Hauritz made his debut in the fourth Test, becoming Queensland's first slow-bowling representative since Trevor Hohns in 1989, and picked up Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman after opening the bowling in the second innings.

A tiny man who cast a shadow little longer than his bat, he played spin with quick feet, and speed with easy confidence; only five men with more than 10,000 first-class runs boast a better average. He captained the Australian Services XI during the 1945 Victory Tests, and became Bradman\'s deputy and eventual successor, leading his country to 14 victories and only four defeats. This, however, falls short of a full estimation: his generosity and deadpan humour won hordes of admirers abroad, especially in England. ""Australia has sent to these shores no captain of cricket who shared Hassett\'s secret into our English ways,"" wrote Neville Cardus, ""knowing it without any surrender of Australia\'s own related yet not entirely similar ways."" He later became a thoughtful radio commentator.', ' ', ' \n', ""HASSETT, ARTHUR LINDSAY, MBE, died on June 16, 1993, aged 79. Lindsay Hassett followed Bradman both as captain of Australia and as the embodiment of the national tradition of pocket-sized batting geniuses. He was of course nowhere near Bradman's class as a batsman, but the two men differed most in their approach to life: Hassett was far more light-hearted and puckish. In 1953 he surrendered the Ashes to England but his team won many friends."", ' Hassett was born at Geelong and was a brilliant sportsman at Geelong College. His name first got noticed when he was a 17-year-old, scoring 147 not out for Combined Victoria Country XI against the West Indians in 1930-31 (it was not noticed everywhere: ', "" called him Bassett), but it took him several more years to establish himself in Victoria's first team. In the early 1930s he had a spell of seven ducks for South Melbourne - and he reckoned he was plumb lbw and dropped twice when he was still in line for his eighth. He made 150 and never looked back. He was chosen to tour England in 1938 and had the chance of 1,000 in May. The runs dried up but none the less he played in every Test of the series, the first four of his 43 Tests."", ""In 1945 he was chosen to lead the Australian Services to Britain for the Victory Tests. He declined a commission and did it all on a sergeant-major's pay of 12 shillings a day. The tour was hugely popular and re-established cricket's role in public life. He began the 1946-47 series against England with a stand of 276 with Bradman, though it was a grinding performance compared to the batting styles of the 1930s. Hassett like the game itself, had changed. Before the war he was a quick-footed attacking player, reliant on the cut and pull, as one would expect from someone of 5ft 6in, but he was also famous for his ability to take on Bill O'Reilly and hit him over the top. Now he was much more patient and cautious. In 1948 he became Bradman's vice-captain and his 137 played an important role in the victory at Nottingham that set the tone for the series. It was said he was chosen as Bradman's successor by only one vote. It may have been remembered that, among other pranks, he had once tied a goat to Bradman's bed. But he was highly successful against South Africa, West Indies and England and his batting remained absolutely staunch. He was 40 at the end of the 1953 tour of England but had scored centuries at Trent Bridge and Lord's. When he finally lost the Ashes, he made a gracious and humorous speech, having been introduced as The Happy Warrior. It was his fourth defeat in 24 Tests as captain, against 14 wins and six draws. In retirement, he ran a sports goods business and commentated until 1981 when, he said, he could stand modem players' behaviour no more. In 216 matches he hit 16,890 at 58.24, an average bettered (amongst players with 10,000 runs or more) only by Bradman, Merchant, Ponsford and Woodfull. He scored 59 centuries in his 290 completed innings, 27 of them overseas. His Test record was 3,073 runs in 43 matches, at 46.56. He was a quick, smart fielder. Cardus described his century at Lord's in 1953 as four and a half hours of cricket so fashioned that the watchmaker's eye was required to detect a loose screw or loose end here or there. He once remarked in a press box during a boring passage: I'm glad I wasn't up here when I was down there. There are others who have made more runs and taken more wickets, but very few have ever got more out of a lifetime, wrote Richie Benaud.

A significant boost in pace came from increased strength and fitness, and by the time he moved to Queensland in 2008 - via a mistaken signing with Sussex on a British passport - he was a genuine fast bowler. His first season with the Bulls brought 33 victims at 26.48 and Australian honours weren't far away. \n"", ""His debut Test series in New Zealand in 2010 brought nine wickets and later that year he claimed nine in the Perth Ashes Test, but in the following match his intensive method of exploding through the crease led to a broken bone in his left ankle that required surgery and ruled him out for half a year. Harris already had a chronic knee injury that will be with him until he retires, but when fit he is invaluable. A hamstring injury ruled him out of the last Test in Sri Lanka in 2011, but already his five-for had helped deliver victory in Galle and his late movement helped make him Australia's leading wicket taker. He flew home from the South African tour later that year with a hip injury that caused him to miss five Tests, and on the West Indies tour in 2012 he was controversially rested for the middle Test of a three-match series. Shoulder surgery in the 2012 winter meant he missed the whole 2012-13 international summer, but a return late in the Sheffield Shield season was encouraging. Despite picking up an Achilles tendon injury in the IPL, he was able to play in the 2013 Ashes in England."", ""Australia's selectors desperately wanted him for that tour, despite the fact that he had not played Tests for nearly 15 months. Despite being left out of the first Test, he was Australia's Player of the Series in the Ashes defeat and his 24 wickets at 19.58 included a career-best 7 for 117 at Chester-le-Street and a five-for at Lord's. One of the few Australians to emerge from that tour with his head held high, Harris was also named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Few people expected him to last the full Ashes series at home, given his history of injuries, but Australia's selectors stuck with him throughout and he repaid them with another outstanding campaign. His 22 wickets at 19.31 put him second only to Mitchell Johnson, and he was Man of the Match at the SCG for his eight-wicket game. He delivered another victory in Cape Town with a bustling and tireless effort late on the final day of the series, with 4 for 32 against South Africa. Knee surgery awaited him immediately when he returned home, but he was able to recover over the winter and play in the home Test series against India.\n""]",['Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy 2002'],27.0,39,11,603.0,74,21.53,955,63.14,0,3,63,9,13,0,21.0,13,7,48.0,21,8.0,48,100.00,0,0,3,1,6.0,0.0,3.0,1,1,2.0,2*,-,1,200.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,82.0,122,20,2056,94,20.15,3231,63.63,0,11,,,41,0,85.0,51,19,411,39,12.84,570,72.10,0,0,,,33.0,0.0,64.0,37,15,239,31,10.86,231,103.46,0,0,12,6,23.0,0.0,27.0,52,5736,2658,113.0,7/117,9/106,23.52,2.78,50.7,4,5,0,21.0,20,1031,832,44.0,5/19,5/19,18.9,4.84,23.4,0,3,0,3.0,3,70,95,4.0,2/27,2/27,23.75,8.14,17.5,0,0,0,82.0,,16387,8045,303,7/60,,26.55,2.94,54.0,15,10,0,85.0,,4135,3394,123,5/19,5/19,27.59,4.92,33.6,3,4,0,64.0,63,1413,1745,81,4/34,4/34,21.54,7.40,17.4,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

His immediate predecessor was Adam Gilchrist, whose presence prevented Haddin from making his Test debut until the age of 30. However, Haddin made up for lost time by eventually becoming vice-captain to Michael Clarke and a key senior figure in a developing side. Never was he more important than in during the 2013-14 Ashes clean-sweep, when he bailed Australia out of tricky positions in every first innings of the campaign. His 493 runs at 61.62 put him second only to David Warner on the run tally and he was nimble behind the stumps, and it was only Mitchell Johnson's reign of terror that prevented Haddin being Player of the Series. \n"", ""By 2014, he was again Australia's preferred keeper in all three formats after two years earlier being usurped by Matthew Wade in all three. Haddin had originally lost his Test spot to Wade after flying home from the 2012 West Indies tour when his 17-month-old daughter Mia was diagnosed with cancer. At 34, it seemed as though his international career might be over, but Haddin showed his dedication by returning to domestic cricket and winning back his place for the 2013 Ashes tour, when Australia's selectors wanted his experience and poise. Renowned as a loyal team man who could be brusque with the media, Haddin was a valuable lieutenant and sounding board for Clarke during the back-to-back Ashes series."", ""Haddin's first taste of Test cricket had come in the West Indies in 2008, when he played through the pain of a broken finger. Flaws in his keeping were on show in India in 2008 but his glovework gradually improved, and a batting breakthrough in 2008-09 gave him confidence. In his 16th Test innings he passed 50 for the first time and went on to 169 against New Zealand in Adelaide, showing flashes Gilchrist would have accepted. An important one-day batsman who shuffled around the order, Haddin also had the chance to captain Australia in T20s in 2009 when Ricky Ponting, Clarke and Michael Hussey were rested. He was also starting to prove himself a productive Test run-maker, which continued on the 2009 Ashes tour with 121 in Cardiff and 80 at Lord's, where he also gave up 20 byes as he struggled to deal with the late movement. A broken finger gave Graham Manou an opening at Edgbaston, but Haddin returned for the final two Tests. "", ""He remained a useful batting contributor in 2009-10 but his highlight was the spectacular, one-handed take at full stretch down the legside off Salman Butt. It was a hugely impressive catch that helped Australia to an unbelievable win at the SCG in 2009-10. (New Zealand supporters find it hard to forget the glove-assisted bowled of Neil Broom in a one-day game the previous summer.) Another injury, a batting-related elbow problem, rubbed him out of the Pakistan series in England, where Tim Paine was used, and after 136 in the opening Ashes Test of 2010-11, Haddin endured a more difficult period in 2011. Notably, he was one of the major culprits in Australia's 47 all out in Cape Town, when at 18 for 5 he backed away and tried to drive Vernon Philander on the up through the off side, gifting South Africa a sixth wicket. A lean home series against India followed, before Wade took his place in the West Indies."", 'A valuable presence in the limited-overs sides, Haddin has scored ODI centuries opening the batting. He is a clean, effortless hitter and his lofted straight drive is among the best shots in the game. He made his ODI debut in 2001 but had to see off the likes of Darren Berry, Wade Seccombe and Ryan Campbell to become keeper-in-waiting behind Gilchrist. A former Australia Under-19 captain who grew up in Gundagai, Haddin began his domestic career in 1997-98 with the ACT Comets in their debut Mercantile Mutual Cup season. Two years later he was playing for New South Wales, and played in their successful Pura Cup/Sheffield Shield finals of 2002-03 and 2007-08, and captained them to the title in 2004-05.\n']",[],66.0,112,13,3266.0,169,32.98,5587,58.45,4,18,363,54,262,8,126.0,115,16,3122.0,110,31.53,3706,84.24,2,16,296,71,170.0,11.0,34.0,29,6,402.0,47,17.47,351,114.52,0,0,30,13,17.0,6.0,184.0,300,39,9932,169,38.05,,,17,56,,,608,40,235.0,221,24,6503,138*,33.01,,,9,35,,,318.0,50.0,97.0,91,13,1747,76,22.39,1384,126.22,0,10,144,67,61.0,20.0,66.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,126.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,34.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,184.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,235.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,97.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

Present at the Test match between Australia and South Africa, he was seized with apoplexy during the luncheon interval and passed away later in the afternoon. Murdoch had a long career as a cricketer but his fame will rest mainly on what he did for the Australian teams of 1880, 1882, and 1884. He captained the three elevens, and in all three he was incontestably the finest batsman. Within the last ten years his performances have been to some extent eclipsed by Victor Trumper, but comparison between the two men would hardly be fair, their methods being so different. Sufficient that in his own day  Murdoch had no serious rival among Australian batsmen, and except WG Grace scarcely a superior in England. It is no injustice to him, however, to say that, depending far more than present-day batsmen upon forward play, he did not rise to great heights on wickets spoilt by rain. The daring pulls and hooks by which bowlers are now so often demoralised were not within his range, and when the ball turned a great deal he was reduced to defence. To be seen at his best, he needed sunshine and a lively pitch. Then he could be great indeed, as those who remember his famous 153 not out at The Oval in 1880 in the first Test match in this country, and his 211 on the same ground in 1884 will not need to be told. \n', ""Few batsmen have been better worth looking at, his style leaving no loophole for criticism. He was essentially an off-side player, his cut and drive being equally fine. Nothing in his play was more skilful than the quickness of foot by which in getting forward at the ball he made up for a limited reach. It could not be urged against him that he was a slow scorer, but if the occasion demanded caution he had inexhaustible patience. In a word, he was in the domain of orthodox batting a complete master. His method served him well, his perfectly straight bat enabling him even at the end of his career to defy lack of condition and get hundreds. So recently as 1904 he scored 140 in the Gentlemen and Players' match at The Oval."", ""In his early days in Australia, Murdoch was a first-rate wicketkeeper and it was chiefly as a wicketkeeper that he secured his place in the Australian team of 1878. He kept wicket in the memorable match against MCC at Lord's -- the match that once for all established the fame of Australian cricket -- but he soon found that he could not hold his own with Blackham, and thenceforward batting became his exclusive study. He had to do some wicketkeeping years afterwards for the ill-starred eleven he captained in England in 1890, but little of his old skill remained, and he found the task distasteful. So great was his reputation as a wicketkeeper in his young days that Spofforth declined to play in the first big match against James Lillywhite's team in 1877 because Blackham had been chosen in preference. In the light of after events this scarcely seems credible, but it is strictly true."", "" Murdoch's career was sharply divided into two parts. Soon after the season of 1884, and following his marriage, he gave up first-class cricket, and little was seen of him in the field till in 1890 he paid his fifth visit to England. It cannot be said that in that year he quite lived up to his reputation, but he played very well, and headed the Australian averages. His doings when he settled in this country, captaining Sussex for several seasons, and afterwards playing for London County, will be fresh in recollection. A man of fine physique and splendid constitution, he ought to have lived to a far greater age than 55. His remains were embalmed, and brought to England for burial at Kensal Green.\n""]",[],19.0,34,5,908.0,211,31.31,,,2,1,,0,14,1,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,391.0,679,48,16953,321,26.86,,,19,85,,,218,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,391.0,,764,430,10,2/11,,43.00,3.37,76.4,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

","['\nKeith Miller enlivened the post-war years with his brilliant all-round play, able to turn a match with an attacking innings or a fiery spell of bowling. He is probably best remembered for his new-ball partnership with Ray Lindwall, but it was as a classical batsman that he first made his mark: a photograph of Miller clipping a textbook square-drive adorned the desk of the cricket-loving Australian prime minister Robert Menzies for many years. \n', 'But ""Nugget"" Miller was more than a cricketer: along with his English soulmate Denis Compton he embodied the idea that there was more to life than cricket. Miller, who was named after two pioneer Australian pilots - Keith and Ross Smith - was a fighter pilot himself in the Second World War, and after some extremely close shaves was well aware of the importance of life. It meant that he could occasionally look disinterested on the field: at Southend in 1948, when the ""Invincible"" Australians were running up the record score of 721 in a day against Essex, Miller stepped away to his first ball and was bowled, since such an unequal contest held little excitement.', 'This approach hardly endeared him to Don Bradman, the unyielding captain of that 1948 side who, possibly significantly, had not seen action during the war. Some mischievous hair-parting bouncers at the great man during Bradman\'s valedictory testimonial match at home after the tour probably didn\'t help either. Miller was initially ludicrously overlooked for Australia\'s next overseas trip - to South Africa in 1949-50 - although he did eventually go, after an injury to another player and a petition from local fans. But with Bradman by then firmly at the helm of the Australian Board, Miller never did captain Australia, although he was a born leader who impressed for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield, and would have been a better bet than Ian Johnson, who was persuaded out of retirement when Lindsay Hassett stood down. Miller did have an unusual approach to captaincy, though: he sometimes set his field by telling the other players ""scatter"". On another occasion, having omitted to nominate a 12th man, he found himself with 12 players on the field. He observed: ""Well, one of you had better bugger off.""', 'Miller started as a batsman, hitting 181 on his first-class debut, for Victoria against Tasmania in Melbourne in 1937-38. And he first made a mark on the international game in 1945, with a sparkling 105 in the first ""Victory Test"" at Lord\'s. Miller made his official Test debut after the war, and went on to play 55 times for Australia, scoring 2958 runs at 36.97, with seven centuries, three of them against England and four against West Indies, whose captain, John Goddard, once sighed, ""Give us Keith Miller and we\'d beat the world.""', ""Bradman's strong side needed Miller more as a bowler than a batsman, and he ended up with 170 Test wickets, at the excellent average of 22.97. He was the perfect foil to the smooth, skiddy Lindwall: Miller would trundle in off a shortish run, but could send down a thunderbolt himself if he felt like it. Or a legspinner. Or a yorker. Or a bouncer, an overdose of which led to his being booed during the 1948 Trent Bridge Test: Miller simply sat down until the barracking had subsided. What few people realised was that he had trouble with his back throughout that tour - he often pressed an errant disc back into place at the base of his spine before somehow sending down another screamer."", ""Despite this Miller remained a fearsome proposition as a bowler, grinning down the pitch at the discomfited batsman, and returning to his mark, flicking back his hair, which was on the long side for that short-back-and-sides era. In 1956, on his third and final tour of England, Miller was rising 37 and hoping not to do much bowling. But his pal Lindwall pulled out of the second Test at Lord's, and his replacement Pat Crawford broke down in his fifth over. Miller shouldered the burden, bowling 34.1 overs in the first innings and 36 in the second, and took five wickets both times to set up Australia's 181-run victory, their only one of that Jim Laker-dominated series. Miller had scored 109 in the 1953 Lord's Test, and remains one of only three players - Garry Sobers and Vinoo Mankad are the others - to have his name on both the batting and bowling honours boards in the visitors' dressing room there."", ""After his retirement Miller remained in the public eye. The social contacts he'd built up - there were unsubstantiated rumours of an affair with Princess Margaret - made him a living as a journalist and columnist, but he was happiest at the cricket or at the races. Late in life he struck up a friendship with Sir Paul Getty, and the two of them would chat unselfconsciously in the Getty box at Lord's, or at the beautiful Wormsley ground, where the cricket on display - serious but spiced with grins and gins - was exactly the type Miller would have loved to play."", 'Neville Cardus dubbed Keith Miller ""the Australian in excelsis"", a notion to which the noted ', ' sportswriter Ian Wooldridge heartily subscribed: ""By God he was right.""

The passing of Ernest Jones, the noted Australian bowler who came to England with the  1896, 1899 and 1902 teams has raised again this absorbing topic. One of the few cricketers of long experience who can speak on the subject as an authority is the old Cambridge and England captain and Yorkshire player, Sir Stanley Jackson. He readily accepted an invitation to a chat, and has been good enough to agree to his opinion being set down in Wisden. Of all the fast bowlers the Australians have sent to this country, I think Jones was the best in my time. I have very good reasons for remembering him, as I took part in the first match he played in this country against Lord Sheffield\'s XI at Sheffield Park, Sussex, in 1896. He was one of the most powerful men I ever met. I believe he was a miner, and in his early days of the tour was very wild in his delivery. This was probably because the Australians came practically straight off the ship to the match and were short of practice. Jones gave me the impression that his main effort was to show his immense pace. The wicket was dry and he bowled short, bumpy stuff. I went in first with W. G. Grace and we had to dance about a bit. One ball from Jones hit W. G. under the arm, and later in the innings another one went head-high past him and over Kelly\'s head to the boundary. This was the ball about which the Beard Story originated. I can see W. G. now. He threw his head back, which caused his beard to stick out. Down the pitch went W. G., stroking his beard, to Harry Trott and said: ""Here, what is all this?"" And Trott said: ""Steady, Jonah."" To which Jones made that famous remark: ""Sorry, Doctor, she slipped."" I do not think the ball actually touched W. G.\'s beard. That story was told after-wards, and I believe I was responsible. When I was out and returned to the Pavilion, I said: ""Did you see that one go through W. G.\'s beard?"" The ball was bouncing, and only Ranji appeared to like it. The pace that Jones was bowling impressed me because in the second innings, when I had made about 10, I had the misfortune to stop one with my ribs, but with the assistance of W. A. J. West, the umpire, who rubbed me, I was able to continue my innings. When I went to London I had a good deal of pain, and my father sent for the doctor, who said, ""It\'s cracked horizontally."" He strapped me up, and I did not play for three weeks. Within a month of Sheffield Park I faced Jones at Lord\'s in the M.C.C. match, and he came up to me and said, ""I am terribly sorry"", and he clasped my hand in a vice-like grip that left me wondering which was the more painful--my hand or broken ribs. Following those early incidents, Harry Trott took Jones in charge and changed him into a very fine bowler. He made him shorten his run and taught him the value of length and control. Jones developed a beautiful action. I believe it has been suggested that he threw, but this I personally regard as absolutely absurd. At that time, the action of some bowlers was not fair, and Sydney Pardon, by his campaign in ', ', did valuable work towards stamping out the trouble. I think it is often forgotten that bowlers, well supported by the field, are the match-winners. You can generally find plenty of batsmen, but genuine bowlers are scarce. Although I never played against him, I would say that Larwood appeared to me the best fast bowler I saw. I have a great admiration for him, with his beautiful rhythmic run and a perfect action which gave him complete control over pace, direction and length. It was these qualities that made him such a fine bowler. I think that he achieved this because at the moment he delivered the ball he was poised high in the air with his left shoulder well up and pointing towards the wicket. It was then that he was complete master of himself, and the control at the end of his run gave him time to deliver the ball the way he wanted. Jones was similar.  Tom Richardson and Lockwood were great bowlers. Lockwood appeared to me the more difficult of the two owing to his ability to change his pace imperceptibly. He had more kinds of deliveries, and his variety, with an occasional very fast ball, made him great. I think Cotter for a few overs was a bit faster than Jones. Kortwright was generally regarded as the fastest bowler of his time in this country. Not only was he a very fast bowler, but also a very good one. While on this subject of bowlers I am very sorry that, besides Jones, another old Australian friend, Charles Turner, has passed away. I always regarded Turner as the best medium-paced bowler I ever played against. He had a graceful run and lovely action, with clever change of pace. I recall my first Test match (1893) at Lord\'s; I had made 91 when, late cutting one from Turner that kept lower than I expected, I was splendidly caught by Blackham. It was a grand catch. His gloves must have been almost under my bat, and he remarked ""Bad luck, youngster. It is one of the biggest flukes I ever had."" In that innings England scored 334, and Turner\'s analysis was: 36 overs, 16 maidens, 67 runs, 6 wickets. We are now thinking of cricket after the war and the best way to improve it. One of the most vital things is the preparation of wickets, and here Jones comes into the story again. The practice of artificial preparation was started by Apted at the Oval in 1899, and he had every excuse. There is very little soil there; within three inches, I believe, you come to gravel. It was the final Test Match, and Hayward (137) and I (118) each made a hundred. We scored 185 for the first wicket in two hours fifty minutes. During our stand Jones, who altogether bowled 53 overs and took four wickets for 164 runs, came to me and tossing the ball up in the air, let it light on the pitch. Instead of bouncing a bit, it stopped dead, and Jones said: This is going to ruin cricket. So, you see, as far back as then we had our problems. Unfortunately one cannot lay down a set rule for making pitches because nearly every ground requires different treatment, but we must try to prepare pitches so as to provide a more even struggle between the bowler and batsman without making the conditions dangerous. In Yorkshire we never put on anything artificial following the end of March. After that, merely roll and water. We used to get real sticky wickets. I remember the time at Sheffield when a side that made 70 against us on a sticky wicket did well because we had such bowlers as Schofield Haigh, Wainwright, Peel, Hirst, Rhodes and myself. Yes, I used to bowl, and I enjoyed it more than batting.  In 1902 at Leeds, F. S. Jackson and Hirst dismissed the Australians in the second innings for 23, each taking 5 wickets. Jackson\'s analysis was 7-1-12-5. The last four wickets fell to him in five balls. Hirst\'s five wickets cost nine runs. Each took four wickets in the first innings, Jackson\'s costing 30 and Hirst\'s 35. The two bowlers were mainly responsible for Yorkshire winning by five wickets. The Australians only other defeat that season was in the Test Match at the Oval when England won by one wicket.\n', ' \n']",[],19.0,26,1,126.0,20,5.04,,,0,0,,,21.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,144.0,209,27,2390,82,13.13,,,0,7,,,107.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19.0,31,3754,1857,64.0,7/88,10/164,29.01,2.96,58.6,2,3,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,144.0,,31755,14638,641,8/39,,22.83,2.76,49.5,,47,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Genial and avuncular, he nonetheless had a mean bouncer and a keen appetite for overs, harvesting 102 wickets at 16.8 on his first tour of England with Don Bradman's 1948 Invincibles, including 9 for 183 from 84 overs in the first Test at Trent Bridge. Historians tend to cast him as an auxiliary to Lindwall and Miller, but he was more reliable than either, and the four years he took to surpass 100 Test wickets was a record. His innings were notable mostly for their beaming brevity, but in January 1952 he held out long enough as last man to help Doug Ring (a team-mate at Melbourne's Richmond club) secure a famous one-wicket victory against West Indies at the MCG, and the following year in England finished atop Australia's tour averages after collecting 102 for only once out."", ' \n', 'Johnston, William Arras, died on May 24, 2007, aged 85. In the early 1950s Bill Johnston was capable of bowling as vicious a bumper as just about any bowler in the world. The problem was it would usually be followed by a chuckle, not the traditional fast bowler\'s wicked laugh but a guffaw that told the batsman there was no malice intended. It was the kind of response which once caused Bill O\'Reilly to lament: ""As a bowler he has one failing - he hasn\'t a temper."" Indeed, his friend and team-mate Neil Harvey recalled: ""His happiness spread itself through the team."" With a secure understanding of his bowling talent, he didn\'t need a temper. Former Test opener Jack Moroney once declared: ""Bill Johnston could do things with a cricket ball that were beyond normal human beings."" And Harvey called him ""one of the best all-round bowlers in the history of cricket"". ', 'Born at Beeac, in the Victorian dairy country, Johnston was originally a slow left-armer but, when he emerged from the RAAF, former Australian captain Jack Ryder advised him to bowl quicker, advice soon reiterated by Don Bradman, who wanted more pace on the 1948 Ashes tour. So Johnston used his height and strength, together with his looseness of limb, to turn himself into a left-arm bowler of immense variety, able to swing the ball at a brisk fast-medium pace, occasionally explode into short episodes of real speed and, when the conditions were right, reach back to the spin of his youth, each variety delivered with probing accuracy. After taking three wickets for Victoria in his first 12 balls against the 1947-48 Indians, he took 14 more in the first three Tests and was then rested, an indicator that he would be on the boat to England. Once there, he was at the forefront of Australia\'s success. He and Lindwall both took 27 wickets in the Tests, and Johnston finished with 102 on tour, his capacity for long spells leading to a place in Wisden\'s (all- Australian) Five in 1949. The First Test at Trent Bridge was typical; having broken the spine of the England batting with 5 for 36 from 25 overs in the first innings, he covered the absence of the injured Lindwall with 4 for 147 from 59 overs in the second. Johnston had only narrowly been chosen for that match ahead of the wrist-spinner Doug Ring. ""What a fortunate decision it was!"" wrote Bradman in ', '.', 'Early in the tour of South Africa in 1949-50, Johnston was injured in a car accident which left him with what he described as ""a nine-iron divot in the top of my skull"". Despite missing two months of cricket and with only one warm-up match, he took 6 for 44 in South Africa\'s second innings of the First Test to seal an innings victory. The succeeding three Australian home series saw Johnston top the aggregates against England, West Indies and South Africa, reaching his 100th Test wicket in only his 22nd match. But against the East Molesey club in a prelude to the 1953 Ashes tour, Johnston twisted his knee so badly that he was forced to change the position of his right foot at the point of delivery. This increased the physical strain of bowling and muffled his effectiveness to the point where he was dropped during the series against West Indies in 1955. Then he retired.', 'As an old-school No. 11, he had his moments of achievement. At Melbourne in 1951-52, he and Ring stole the Test from under the noses of the West Indians with a stand of 38 which was a mixture of scampered singles and the occasional bludgeoning. Three years later, against England at Sydney, he gave canny support to Neil Harvey as they added 39 of the 78 that would have brought victory against a rampant Frank Tyson, even swinging the disbelieving bowler one-handed off his hip to the boundary. And there was the artfully contrived mockery of statistics which saw him head the batting averages on the 1953 tour of England (I 17, NO 16, R 102, HS 28*, Avge 102.00). This was made possible by Lindsay Hassett, towards the end of the tour, giving his batting partners protective instructions and sending notes to opposing county captains requesting complicity. Ray Robinson said that, as a fielder, he was ""galumphing"", and that when he chased the ball he looked like ""Pluto in pursuit of Donald Duck"". But Johnston redeemed that with a powerful arm, and the faults merely added to the good humour he brought to the\ncricket field.', 'Johnston had a varied working life during which he was a salesman for Dunlop, before becoming the marketing manager for a shoe firm, and running a pub, an apartment complex and a post office.

That summit came during 2013-14, when in successive series he cowed the batsmen of England and South Africa with his speed and aggression. In those eight Tests he collected 59 wickets at 15.23, along with a big bunch of cherries on helmets and gloves. Not surprisingly it led to Johnson winning his first Allan Border Medal, and at the age of 32 he was finally achieving the sorts of feats that Dennis Lillee might have expected when he first spotted Johnson's talent as a 17-year-old. There had been other highlights along the way for Johnson, including brutal spells against South Africa in 2008-09, but the lows of his 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes campaigns left his legacy looking uncertain. Nerves and family problems contributed to those struggles, but a broken toe in 2011 gave him time away from the game and the chance to reflect on where he was going. \n"", ""It was still far from smooth sailing: he offered little on the 2013 tour of India and was not even picked for the 2013 Ashes in England, but his return for the home Ashes that followed was emphatic. Wearing a moustache reminiscent of Lillee, he delivered a series of fast-bowling spells that would not have been out of place in the Lillee-Thomson era. Johnson intimidated with his bouncer and made England's batsmen seriously uncomfortable; that he was Player of the Series was no surprise. As described by "", ', the mood changed whenever he tore in: ""This was something visceral: a hush followed by a crescendo"". A 12-wicket Test in Centurion in Australia\'s next series showed that it was no fluke. After that South African tour Johnson\'s pace eased off again, but he remained a strike weapon and became the fifth Australian bowler to take 300 wickets in Tests.  ', ""An athlete who started out preferring tennis, Johnson was late to focus on cricket and suffered early in his career with four back stress fractures that almost floored him for good. He persevered, driving a plumbing van when he lost his Queensland contract, and made his Test debut in 2007 after the retirement of Glenn McGrath. With a strong, flowing run to the crease, Johnson can become mechanical in delivery, especially if his wrist, a long-term concern, is in the wrong position. When it's bad, he sprays the ball on both sides of the wicket like an old-fashioned firebrand. When it's perfect, there are few better bowlers in the game.

Unfortunately for him, he took over in the mid-1950s, when Australian cricket was decidedly inferior to England's for the first time since before the Bradman era, and he became the first 20th-century captain to lead Australia to defeats in successive Ashes series. His problems were worsened because he had been controversially preferred to Keith Miller, and many Australians regarded him almost as a usurper. Inter-state rivalry had played a part in Johnson's selection, but it was also a rather English sort of decision: Johnson, who had something of an amateur's bearing, appealed more to many members of the Australian establishment than the more wayward Miller. But he was a fine cricketer and, in some respects, a visionary. \n"", "" Johnson made his debut for Victoria as an 18-year-old and emerged, after wartime service, as a mainstay of Australia's attack. He was an off-spinner in a country traditionally keener on wrist-spin and, according to E. W. Swanton, probably the slowest bowler to achieve any measure of success in Test cricket. His action was compared to a corkscrew (and occasionally had its legality queried), but in the right circumstance his flight and dip could not merely tantalise batsmen, but madden them. Against England at Sydney 1946-47, he floated the ball into the breeze to take six for 42 in 30.1 eight-ball overs. Though he did little in the Tests in England in 1948, Johnson reasserted himself in South Africa in 1949-50, taking five for 34 to help win the Durban Test. But his form declined after that, and he failed to make the 1953 tour of England. Later that year, he succeeded Lindsay Hassett as captain of Victoria, but there seemed little chance of him playing for Australia again. That changed after a pep-talk from Hassett himself at a New Year's Eve party, when he hinted that Johnson could be captain of Australia if only he put his mind to it. By the end of the year, the prophecy had come true. Johnson can hardly be remembered as a great Test captain: of his nine Ashes Tests in charge, in 1954-55 and 1956, Australia lost four and won just two. But his finest hour came in between those series when he led their first Test tour of the Caribbean, only 12 months after a notably bad-tempered visit by England. They won not merely the series but the people's hearts, with a charm offensive that led to much favourable comparison with the stand-offish English: Ian did the best PR job of any captain I've ever seen, said Alan Davidson. But Johnson's own form was patchy, and this worsened the dressing-room tensions: some malcontents called him myxomatosis because he only bowled when the rabbits were in, and he was seen by others as dictatorial. The 1956 tour was unwinnable, and impossible to survive. After an epilogue in the subcontinent on the way home had mixed results, he retired."", 'The following year Johnson began the second half of his career. He was chosen ahead of 44 other candidates to be secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club. This really did cement his place in the Australian establishment, but he was a progressive administrator: the MCG remained the beating heart of Australian sport, and Johnson was there, mostly smiling, through 26 years of dramatic change. For 56 years he was married to Lal, daughter of Roy Park, who played one Test for Australia. He had a knack for getting things right: on his South African tour in 1949-50 he wrote a series of pieces for the local paper, the ', '. One touched on the racial question.

His most famous contribution was in 1992-93, in the fourth Test against the West Indies. Recalled to the team and playing on his home ground in Adelaide, he brought Australia back into contention with career-best figures of 5 for 9 off 6.5 overs, and then shared in a 40-run last-wicket stand with Craig McDermott - only to witness his partner's dismissal from the non-striker's end.

A resourceful batsman, he combined sound defence with good hitting; he could also cut gracefully and vigorously, while in the long-field he was excellent, covering much ground and being a sure catch. He made his first appearance for New South Wales at the age of twenty-one, but it was not until the season of 1894-5 that he began to make a name for himself. Then he did very well against Mr. Stoddart's team, and, maintaining his form, was one of the first men chosen for the trip to England in 1896. Until the latter part of June he did not during that tour perform up to his reputation, but then in quick succession he scored 94 not out v. Notts, 114 v. Yorkshire, 106 v. Hampshire, 171 v. Players, 108 in the Test-match at Manchester, 73 v. Derbyshire and 62 v. M.C.C. During the tour only S. E. Gregory, Darling and Hill had better records, his average for 1,328 runs being 27.32. Coming to England again three years later he made 1,039 runs and averaged 29.68, his largest innings being 115 v. W. G. Grace's XI at the Crystal Palace and 111 v. Middlesex at Lord's. In all Test-matches, both at home and abroad, against England he scored 807 runs with an average of 36.68, his highest effort being 140 against Stoddart's Team at Adelaide in 1894-5.

South Australia in 1895-6. Playing his last game for his State in 1901-2, he had a short though brilliant career in great matches. From early in 1922 until his death he was Secretary of the N.S.W.

Jaques finished the 2008 West Indies tour with a century in the final Test, but he was dropped for the next match in India when Matthew Hayden returned and Simon Katich was the preferred partner.

Some complications, more surgery and the emergence of Phillip Hughes meant there were no openings even after Hayden's retirement.

The next ODI was a jet-lagged memory after he was summoned to South Africa, scored zero and went home as soon as Ponting's stomach improved.

For the brash 21-year-old who waltzed into the Australian team at Dean Jones's expense, batting was an exercise in extravagance. To defend was to display weakness - a policy that backfired in 1993-94 when Martyn's airy square-drive at a crucial moment in Sydney triggered a five-run defeat by South Africa and a six-year hitch to his own promising career. By the time Western Australia, wanting a pretty face to spearhead their marketing campaign, had made him captain at 23, Martyn looked a tormented man. All the more remarkable, then, that he blossomed into a relaxed, classical, feathery artist. He was an elastic fieldsman and an old-style batsman whose first movement was back. He played with a high elbow, a still head, a golfer's deft touch, and had all the shots, including perhaps the most brutal reverse-sweep in the game.  \n"", 'Mostly, though, Martyn stuck to the textbook and composed pristine hundreds which, like the feats of the best wicketkeepers, passed almost unnoticed: an observation supported by the curious fact that, despite a Test average in the fifties, he reached the age of 30 without winning a Man-of-the-Match award. He was the quiet man of the 2003 World Cup-raising side, too, playing a minor role until he spanked 88 not out in the final - with a broken finger that later kept him out of a West Indian tour. His magnificent 13-month streak of 1608 Test runs at 61 and two Man-of-the-Series prizes from March 2004 finally moved him from the dressing-room shadows to the more uncomfortable limelight. Showing his hard-earned versatility, he crafted seven centuries on surfaces ranging from raging turners in Sri Lanka and India to green seamers in New Zealand and the hard bounce of home. ', 'The flood ended in England and following a series of 178 runs and a couple of horrid umpiring decisions he was the major casualty of the Ashes loss. Retaining a one-day spot, he expected his five-day days were over - ""If that\'s my last Test match, well, I\'ve had a great time"" - but was reprieved when the selectors wanted experience for the South Africa tour. As the decision to ignore policy by looking back to a 34 year old became increasingly doubtful, Martyn repaid with a nerveless 101 that led to victory in the final Test. After being a key part in Australia\'s first Champions Trophy success, he struggled in the opening two Tests of the Ashes series and swiftly retired. ', ""In February 2008 he swung another surprise of sorts by announcing he had joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League and when that became defunct, comeback-kid Martyn had another unexpected return, signing for Shane Warne's IPL side Rajasthan Royals for US$100,000 in January 2010.

The international grounding and a backyard net helped develop Marsh into one of the finest young run-makers in the country. It also gave him a taste of what he could expect when he joined the national team. He made a successful start to his ODI career in 2008 and then scored a superb century on Test debut in Sri Lanka in 2011. Marsh looked set for a lengthy tenure as Australia's No.3 but a back injury suffered during Australia's disastrous Cape Town Test later that year proved a serious setback. Marsh rejoined the side for the home Tests against India but was a shadow of himself, and 17 runs from six innings was a calamitous return. He was recalled for the 2014 tour of South Africa and scored 148 in Centurion, but was dropped again after making a pair in the next Test.  Another recall came at home against India when Michael Clarke was injured, and 99 at the MCG suggested he still had something to offer.  \n"", 'But in his only Test on the 2015 Ashes tour he scored 0 and 2, and it seemed that might have been his last chance. Until he was given another, included to replace the injured Usman Khawaja for the inaugural day-night Test against New Zealand in 2015-16. Permanency has never arrived, however, through a mixture of form and injury. It felt as though the 2017-18 Ashes promised something better with two hundreds in the series, including one against the pink ball in Adelaide, but there was a subsequent slump in form that again brought the spotlight on his position.', 'Marsh has appealed to a series of Australian selection panels, who have viewed him as a viable top-order prospect in Tests and ODIs especially. His first-class record may be underwhelming for a man given so many chances and his penchant for nicking off early has proved a frustration, but he has also shown himself to be capable of scoring hundreds at the highest level. More gifted than his father - ""He\'s got a few more shots than me,"" Geoff once said - Marsh is a left-hander who impressed the tough judges of Steve and Mark Waugh while scoring his maiden first-class century in 2003. The milestone arrived with two sixes in a row over midwicket off Mark Waugh\'s offspin and a rash of compliments. ""It\'s a pretty good feeling when the Australia captain comes up to you and says \'well done, mate\',"" Marsh said. Marsh is at his best when playing classical shots and keeping the ball along the ground, which has been effective even in the shorter formats of the game.

But after an inauspicious debut batting at No.3 against India in Adelaide, he was switched to opener where he began to solidify his spot, as well as the fragile top order, forming famous partnerships with two future Australian greats - firstly David Boon and then Mark Taylor.  His steely, often grim, resolve in Tests was a contrast to his one-day batting, and it was in that he really flourished and found his true niche. His 117 one-day internationals yielded 4357 runs at an imposing average just shy of 40, which was almost seven runs higher than his Test average. His nine centuries and 22 half-centuries provided the platform for many Australian victories, with the highlight being the 1987 World Cup final triumph over England in India.   \n', ""When he stepped into the coaching shoes left by long-time mentor Bob Simpson in July 1996, Marsh took control of an Australian side that was the best Test-playing nation in the world, but whose one-day team had been unable to build on the success of 1987.  But Marsh seemingly made a seamless transition, and managed to not only continue Australia's awesome form in the Test arena but, after a few hiccups along the way, transform the one-day team into world champs yet again. He enjoyed Test series victories in the West Indies, Ashes triumphs and a historic win in Pakistan, with a 2-1 defeat in India in 1998 the only blemish. But like his own playing career, it will perhaps again be his one-day achievements that are most fondly remembered.  After a faltering start to their 1999 World Cup campaign, Marsh orchestrated a stunning turnaround by the pre-tournament favourites, with the rampant Australians winning seven pulsating matches in a row, culminating in a crushing victory over a hapless Pakistan in the final, to lift the World Cup trophy for the second time.  "", ""After quitting the Australian job, Marsh was briefly an Australian selector before, in 2001, he took on an altogether different challenge - coaching Zimbabwe. But his tenure coincided with the politicalisation of the national side, and the defection of many key players, and his position became more marginalised and hopeless.

JOHN JAMES, born at Gawler, in South Australia, on May 21, 1863, died in Adelaide on July 21, aged 64. He visited this country on three occasions--in 1888, 1890, and 1893. Those whose cricket memories go back over 30 years, will remember him as a very fine hitter indeed. He was not, perhaps, so famous as George Bonnor, nor did he have the same capacity for scoring on all sorts of wickets as Percy McDonnell. In fact, when the ball was turning he generally proved an easy victim to a spin bowler. On a hard, true wicket, however, he was a most dangerous bat, and likely to demoralize the best of bowlers. Before coming here first he had established his reputation, and in the winter of 1891-2 he played an innings of 134 in a Test matches at Sydney against Lord Sheffield's team, captained by W. G. Grace. It was in 1893 that people in England saw him at his best, when in all matches he had an aggregate of 1,605, a highest score of 149, and an average of over 28. He again headed the batting in representative matches, 23 innings yielding him 761 runs and an average of 33. In May, 1893, at Lord's, Lyons played probably the most brilliant innings of his career. The Australians had to go in a second time against a powerful M.C.C. team 181 runs behind. Yet these were hit off before a wicket fell by Lyons and Alec Bannerman, and of this number Lyons obtained no fewer than 149. As such a terrific pace did he score that he completed his 100 in an hour, with the total at 124. The strokes of Lyons's innings were twenty-two 4's, three 3's, twenty 2's, and only twelve singles, and to this day people who saw that day's play describe his batting as the greatest display of fast-footed driving ever given at Lords. \n"", ""Lyons' batting overshadowed the rest of his cricket but he was at times distinctly useful as a bowler. Against one of the English teams at Adelaide in 1887-8 he took seven wickets for 94 run for South Australia, and in the Test match at Lord's in 1890 he had an analysis of five for 30 besides being chief scorer for his side with 55 and 33. As a benefit he received part proceeds of the match between South Australia and New South Wales at Adelaide in 1925-6, when, from all sources, the sum realised was £1,252.

The previous year, he had taken up a job on the Adelaide Oval groundstaff, and his bowling talent was spotted by the Redbacks' Big Bash coach Darren Berry. Lyon impressed in Twenty20s for South Australia, made his first-class debut, and within seven months was a Test cricketer. A classical offspinner who flights the ball and looks for wickets, Lyon struck with his first ball in Test cricket when he had Kumar Sangakkara caught at slip in Galle. It was part of a haul of 5 for 34 and the beginning of a career that would, for the most part, end Australia's cycle of churning through Test spinners in the post-Warne era. By 2015, Lyon had become Australia's most successful Test offspinner of all time, passing Hugh Trumble's tally of 141 wickets, and following the post-Ashes retirements of Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin and Shane Watson, he became one of the team's most experienced players. \n"", ""However, Lyon's career was not without bumps along the way. In 2013 he was dropped from the Test team twice, first in India after he was attacked by MS Dhoni in the first Test in Chennai, and then for the first two Tests of the Ashes tour of England. The Ashes axing was especially galling for Lyon, given that he had taken nine wickets in his previous Test, the fourth and final Test of the Indian tour in Delhi, and he was overlooked for the uncapped teenager Ashton Agar. By the third Test of the Ashes, Lyon was rightfully back in the side and continued to be a consistent performer. One gap in his game had been the ability to bowl Australia to victory in the fourth innings of a Test, but he finally achieved that against India in Adelaide in 2014-15, in what became his first Man-of-the-Match performance. Lyon has also played a handful of one-day internationals but, despite first making his name for South Australia in T20, he has generally been considered by the national selectors a Test-only prospect.\n"", '\n']",[],86.0,111,34,923.0,47,11.98,2007,45.98,0,0,116,5,41.0,0.0,21.0,11,8,69.0,30,23.0,73,94.52,0,0,7,2,4.0,0.0,2.0,1,1,4.0,4*,-,4,100.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,145.0,185,53,1682,75,12.74,3431,49.02,0,2,196,15,63.0,0.0,63.0,31,17,205,37*,14.64,199,103.01,0,0,18,8,27.0,0.0,40.0,15,6,51,11,5.66,54,94.44,0,0,4,0,12.0,0.0,86.0,164,21905,11059,343.0,8/50,13/154,32.24,3.02,63.8,13,14,2,21.0,21,1182,942,22.0,4/44,4/44,42.81,4.78,53.7,1,0,0,2.0,2,30,48,1.0,1/33,1/33,48.00,9.6,30.0,0,0,0,145.0,266,34445,17632,510,8/50,13/154,34.57,3.07,67.5,20,16,2,63.0,62,3421,2739,76,4/10,4/10,36.03,4.80,45.0,4,0,0,40.0,39,820,981,49,5/23,5/23,20.02,7.17,16.7,1,1,0,False,False,False,False

Ashes opponent John Warr held that ""if one were granted one last wish in cricket, it would be the sight of Ray Lindwall opening the bowling in a Test match"". His powerful, rhythmic approach, unwavering control and late swing brought a hush to arenas all over the world: when he yorked Len Hutton with the second ball of the Headingley Test of July 1953, it was received with the solemnity of a declaration of war. Like his longtime bowling partner Keith Miller, Lindwall could also bat with spirit and adventure: his Test century at Melbourne in January 1947 was the second-fastest by an Australian. His autobiography, Flying Stumps, is a book of rare charm.', ' \n', ""\nRaymond Russell Lindwall MBE died on June 23, 1996, aged 74. Ray Lindwall was undeniably one of the great fast bowlers, arguably the greatest of all the Australian practitioners, and perhaps the man who established fast bowling's role in the modern game. In the 1930s the game had been dominated by batsmen, with the brief, unacceptable, interlude of Bodyline. Lindwall began a new era in which bat and ball were more evenly matched, when the bouncer (or  bumper as it was then called) was an accepted weapon, provided it was not overused. He bowled the bumper sparingly but brilliantly, and the mere possibility of it made batsmen uneasy. He thus paved the way for all the other great fast bowlers of the post-war era, from Trueman to Ambrose. But in fact more than two-fifths of Lindwall's 228 Test victims were bowled."", ""Ray was a Sydney boy and watched Larwood during the Bodyline series. He played with other kids on patches of green and in the streets, choosing - it is said - the street down which the great leg-spinner Bill O'Reilly walked home in the hope of catching his eye. He was also a promising batsman, scoring a double-century and a century in different junior matches on the same day. At the St George club, he came under the wing of O'Reilly, who used the novel technique of photography to help the lad correct his faults. But Lindwall was a smart learner and dedicated to practice; during the war, when he was in the South Pacific and suffered horribly from tropical diseases, he marked out his run-up between the palm trees and got his bowling into a beautiful groove. Halfway through the home 1946-47 series against England, he and Keith Miller emerged as the undisputed leaders of Australia's attack; on top of that Lindwall actually beat Miller to a Test century, scoring 100 at the MCG in the New Year Test of 1947, batting at No. 9. At Sydney two months later, Lindwall took seven for 63 and, after getting seven for 38 against India in 1947-48, came to England in 1948 an established star."", ""On that tour, he rose to even greater fame as the leader of the attack in Australia's 4-0 triumph. And though Bradman used him carefully, his very presence dictated the terms. Lindwall was injured during the First Test, but in three of the subsequent four he was devastating, reaching his peak at the Oval when he took six for 20 as England were bowled out for 52. He had a clever slower ball (which would have stood him in good stead in modern one-day cricket) and, though his arm was too low to satisfy the sternest purists, he was close to being the complete fast bowler. The low arm meant his bowling had a skidding effect, which made the bouncers all the more fearsome. Sir Pelham Warner once exclaimed Poetry! and Lindwall, watching himself on film, discovered that all the effort and pain failed to transmit itself to anyone else. I don't look tired, he murmured with surprise."", "" Lindwall never quite reached such a peak after 1948, but he played Test cricket for more than another decade. Jack Fingleton said Lindwall never liked bowling much, and always preferred batting, but he was opening Australia's attack as late as January 1960, when he was 38, and played the last of his 61 Tests a few weeks later. Lindwall simply would not go away. Inevitably, his shock effect had declined by then but, like his eventual heir Dennis Lillee, he compensated by his canniness, mastery of technique - he began to use the in-swinger far more - and utter determination. He captained Australia once and, for several seasons, Queensland, having moved from New South Wales, before finishing with 228 Test wickets at 23.03 and 794 first-class wickets at 21.35."", 'He was a much liked man but not a flamboyant character like Miller. Cardus rated Lindwall alongside Ted McDonald as the most hostile and artistic fast bowlers I have ever seen- but preferred to write about Miller, who was better copy. Lindwall was a quieter man, whose strongest adjective was his own concoction, blooing. He was a phenomenal all-round sportsman: had he not played cricket, Lindwall could easily have been a rugby league international, and he ran 100 yards in 10.6 seconds. But when he retired he ran a flower shop with his wife in the centre of Brisbane. If anyone in Australia ever imagined floristry was unmanly, his presence in the shop provided an answer, though he concentrated on the figures, and his assistant claimed he could not tell a rose from a dandelion.', ""While still playing for New South Wales, he once saw the young Alan Davidson bowl a bouncer at an opposing No. 8. You've just insulted all fast bowlers, Lindwall told him. You've admitted No. 8 can bat better than you can bowl. Get into the nets and learn how to bowl. And he took him there, and taught him.\n""]","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1949', 'Australian Cricket Hall of Fame 1996']",61.0,84,13,1502.0,118,21.15,,,2,5,,13,26.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,228.0,270,39,5042,134*,21.82,,,5,19,,,123.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61.0,113,13650,5251,228.0,7/38,9/70,23.03,2.30,59.8,8,12,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,228.0,,43215,16956,794,7/20,,21.35,2.35,54.4,,34,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

However, Lillee made a famous recovery following a regime of intensive physiotherapy.', ""In the mid-1970s Lillee was teamed up with express paceman Jeff Thomson. They became the most feared bowling pairing of the era and inflicted greatest damage on England: rattling the tourists' batsmen in the 1974-75 series in Australia; and then setting up (with Max Walker) an away series win a few months later in the first Test at Birmingham."", 'Throughout his career, Lillee also had a superb partner behind the stumps in wicketkeeper Rod Marsh. The dismissal ""caught Marsh, bowled Lillee"" appears 95 times on Test cards, a record pairing which has yet to be seriously challenged.', ""After a match-shaping performance in the 1977 Centenary Test against England, Australia's Test team temporarily lost Lillee's services to World Series Cricket. During this time, Lillee continued to work on his fitness, and honed the efficiency of his approach and delivery action."", ""Further fine performances after his return to Test cricket and through to the early 1980s reflected Lillee's increased ability to outwit batsmen. He had lost some of the pace of his youth but continued to exploit batsmen's weaknesses utilising clever variations in length, pace and movement."", ""His best Test figures were achieved in a remarkable match against the West Indies in 1981. To the delight of the MCG crowd, Lillee sent opener Desmond Haynes and nightwatchman Colin Croft back to the pavilion late on day one, and then bowled Vivian Richards to leave the tourists stunned at 4 for 10 at stumps. Lillee - who passed Gibbs' wicket-taking record with Larry Gomes' dismissal the following day - ended up with 7 for 83 in the first innings and 10 wickets for the match, and Australia recorded a famous upset win."", ""Lillee, who was named in Australia's Test Team of the Century and the Hall of Fame, now has an international reputation as a fast bowling coach. Until recently he also continued to bowl for the ACB Chairman's XI against touring sides, and remained a challenge to Test-class batsman. In 1999-2000, the 50-year-old bowed out of these matches in befitting fashion, with Dennis and his son Adam taking three wickets apiece against a Pakistan touring side.

Like India. A swing bowler who learned to weave outswingers on Gabba greentops, Kasprowicz matured into a subcontinental specialist with reverse-swing, heavy cut and a this-isn't-too-hot-for-another-over attitude. He bravely carried an injury-hit attack struck by Navjot Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar in 1997-98, popped back in 2001 and returned in 2004 to help end India's 35-year hold. And when his first-class career finished in 2007-08 he joined the Indian Cricket League. \n"", ""After three years mostly spent refining his efficient yet aggressive action with Queensland and Glamorgan, Kasprowicz celebrated his fifth recall in 2004 with 13 matches, his longest Test run. During the wildly successful year the prongs of McGrath, Gillespie and Kasprowicz were so sharp that Brett Lee ran their refreshments. To call Kasprowicz a workhorse is unflattering even though the description matches his stamina and size - he was an Australian Schoolboys rugby forward. Regularly clocked faster than his new-ball counterparts (excluding Lee) from a shorter run, Kasprowicz's angle and dart-perfect line caused constant headaches for international left-handers in the style of Paul Reiffel, another under-rated third wheel. He became an important clean-up or go-to man and only four times in 2004 did he leave an innings without a wicket as he collected 47 victims. "", ""An intimidating and muscular presence at county and state level - he often broke bones in England and peer pressure from Pura Cup batsmen hurried his Test and one-day returns - Kasprowicz became Queensland's leading wicket-taker in 2003-04, but after missing most of 2006-07 he had a battle to stay ahead of his best man Andy Bichel. Back and groin problems, which started in South Africa and were irritated by the pre-Ashes boot camp, limited him to a season of eight deliveries for Queensland and he lost his Cricket Australia deal. The problems also contributed to an abbreviated final campaign of 15 breakthroughs, which was enough for him to retire as the state's highest wicket-taker with 501 first-class dismissals - at the time it was 38 more than Bichel."", ""Popular and cheerful off the field, `Kasper' experienced the lows of being 12th man for Queensland's first Sheffield Shield win in 1994-95, waiting five months and three Tests for his first wicket and completing a regular do-si-do for a national place with Bichel. However, his greatest miss came during the 2005 Ashes series when his courageous 59-run partnership with Lee at Edgbaston ended three short of victory. After adding 20 he gloved a contentious catch behind and England levelled the series 1-1. Returning from that tour on the outer, he responded with 44 Pura Cup wickets for the Bulls and was recalled for the trip to South Africa, where he and Lee reversed their Birmingham nightmare with a 19-run stand that earned a nail-biting two-wicket victory.

As a left-handed middle-order batsman, he possessed a highly distinctive style, this endearing him to crowds which otherwise might have found his rate of scoring unendurably slow. At the crease he stood impassively, cap at a rakish angle, knees slightly bent, chewing compulsively. He employed negligible backlift and was an uncanny judge of line, often leaving balls that seemed to make the bails quiver. When a stroke was required, his most prolific were a deflection wide of cover-point's right hand and a type of shovel shot past mid-wicket. He was more often a match-saver than a match-winner. Very occasionally he would play an innings of remarkable and unexpected aggression and unorthodoxy, one such being at Lord's against Middlesex in 1961 when he made a whirlwind 168. As a right-arm medium-paced bowler, he became in the early sixties a useful member of the Australian attack, possessing the ability to contain batsmen for long periods and often taking good wickets. He had a stealthy, almost apologetic approach to the wicket, but the innocuous appearance of his deliveries masked subtle variations of pace and swing. \n"", "" Slasher MacKay first played grade cricket in Brisbane at the age of fifteen. By 1946 he had won a place in the Queensland side, the start of a first-class career that lasted for eighteen years and included 100 appearances for his state and 37 for Australia. He became captain of Queensland in 1954-55 and in 1956 toured England with Ian Johnson's side. He made his Test début at Lord's, in the only Test won by Australia that summer, batting for more than seven hours in the match, yet scoring only 38 and 31. In his second innings, which lasted for 264 minutes, he fulfilled what was to become a familiar sheet-anchor role while Benaud played a brilliant innings of 97. MacKay's performance in the next two Tests threatened his international career: at Headingly he made 2 and 2, at Old Trafford Laker dismissed him for a pair. He was dropped for the last Test at The Oval and was not an original selection for Ian Craig's team to tour South Africa in 1957-58. However, he was added to Craig's side at the last moment and, with Test scores of 3, 65 not out, 63, 32, 52 not out, 83 not out and 77 not out, he justified his selection."", "" MacKay's best Test performances were achieved on a tour of Pakistan and India in 1959-60. On a matting wicket at Dacca he helped Australia to gain their first Test win in Pakistan, recording in the second innings the remarkable bowling figures of 45-27-42-6. Against India at Madras he made his highest Test score, 89 - ended, somewhat surprisingly, when he was stumped. His best-remembered Test innings must have been against West Indies at Adelaide in 1961, the series of the tied Test. With 100 minutes of the game remaining Australia, trailing by many runs, lost their ninth wicket. As Lindsay Kline joined MacKay a West Indian victory seemed assured. However, dour defence by both batsmen frustrated all the efforts of Worrell's side and the game ended with Australia's last pair still together, MacKay undefeated with 62, made in almost four hours. He played his last Test against England at Adelaide in January, 1963, and not long afterwards announced his retirement from first-class cricket, his final appearance being for Queensland against Victoria in 1964. In affection and gratitude, the people of Brisbane contributed some £20,000 to a bob in for Slasher campaign, conducted by the city's morning paper. For fifteen years after his retirement MacKay was a state selector, and in 1977 he was appointed state coach for Queensland.

As a stocky, free-scoring left-hander, Lehmann was able to treat spectators to an audacious mixture of aggression and deft finesse. Having arrived on the state cricket scene as a 17-year-old, Lehmann had played more first-class games and scored more runs than any other Australian before making his Test debut in Bangalore in 1998, although his record was later beaten by Michael Hussey. He initially struggled to hold down his Test spot but eventually bucked the trend of youth by establishing himself in the Australia side at 33 with a maiden hundred at Port-of-Spain in his tenth Test, and then two against both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the next 12 months. Named stand-in vice-captain for the 2004 India tour when Ricky Ponting broke his thumb, Lehmann offered to give up his place to Michael Clarke after his amazing debut century at Bangalore, and limped out of the series after the third Test with a torn hamstring. He returned for the home summer but was dropped for good after struggling against Pakistan. \n', ""Lehmann's talents won him far more regular opportunities in Australia's one-day international team and in 1999 he had the honour of hitting the winning runs in the World Cup final at Lord's. He was also a key member of the side that defended the title four years later, although his entry into the tournament was delayed by a suspension for a racist dressing-room outburst. An integral member of winning Sheffield Shield sides in 1990-91 and 1995-96 and Yorkshire's victorious County Championship team of 2001, Lehmann finished his first-class career as the highest run scorer in Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup history, with 13,635 runs at 54.97. He entered coaching via the IPL, where he was at the helm of the Deccan Chargers when they won the tournament in 2009. Lehmann was named coach of Queensland in early 2011 and quickly won the respect of the players for his straightforward approach. Under Lehmann, the Bulls won the 2011-12 Sheffield Shield and the 2012-13 Ryobi Cup.

His ankles were a popular site for surgery and there were also side strains and stress fractures in a familiar cycle of breath-taking pace, painful injury and long-term layoff.', ""After starting by shaking up batsmen with short balls and yorkers, Lee became a smarter operator under Ricky Ponting's captaincy and knew when to deliver a burst of speed or a containing spell. In nine Tests following McGrath's departure, Lee stood up with 58 victims at 21.55 and also won the Allan Border Medal in 2008. During that period he helped keep the rebuilding side on top of the world. "", ""Life soon became harder again and after returning from more ankle surgery - his last act in a Test was limping off the MCG with a broken foot - he missed the 2009 Ashes with a side strain. England wasn't a kind host for Lee, who was consoled by Andrew Flintoff during his absorbing yet heart-breaking batting near-miss in Edgbaston in 2005. He was a courageous run-maker who would deflect or absorb the efforts of opposing fast men as they searched for payback."", 'A gentleman off the field, he was aggressive on it and rarely went over the top in comparison to his team-mates, although his bouncers at the tail-enders were uncomfortable viewing. Mostly he was a shining example to young players in all forms of the game. He retired from Tests at the beginning of 2010 to prolong his career in the shorter forms: in those affairs he could stay true to himself by attempting to operate at optimum speed while reducing the load on his aching body. He finally retired from all international cricket in July 2012.']","['Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year - 2000', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2006', 'Test Player of the Year - 2008', 'Allan Border Medal - 2008']",76.0,90,18,1451.0,64,20.15,2739,52.97,0,5,182,18,23.0,0.0,221.0,110,44,1176.0,59,17.81,1407,83.58,0,3,69,35,54.0,0.0,25.0,12,6,101.0,43*,16.83,71,142.25,0,0,9,4,6.0,0.0,116.0,139,25,2120,97,18.59,,,0,8,,,35.0,0.0,262.0,134,54,1365,59,17.06,,,0,3,,,62.0,0.0,120.0,56,26,416,48,13.86,317,131.23,0,0,30,22,28.0,0.0,76.0,150,16531,9554,310.0,5/30,9/171,30.81,3.46,53.3,17,10,0,221.0,217,11185,8877,380.0,5/22,5/22,23.36,4.76,29.4,14,9,0,25.0,25,545,714,28.0,3/23,3/23,25.50,7.86,19.4,0,0,0,116.0,,24193,13746,487,7/114,,28.22,3.40,49.6,,20,2,262.0,,13475,10534,438,5/22,5/22,24.05,4.69,30.7,15,10,0,120.0,120,2706,3258,109,4/28,4/28,29.88,7.22,24.8,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

Much later, Mike Atherton compared McGrath to Ambrose on a vaster scale. Catapulted from the outback of New South Wales into Test cricket to replace Merv Hughes in 1993, McGrath became the greatest Australian fast bowler of his time. He went on to beat Courtney Walsh\'s 519 wickets in the 2005 Super Test to become the leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers and his claim to the title of Australia\'s greatest fast man is contested only by Dennis Lillee. His obituary was prepared a few times - he was doubted after coming back in 2004 from ankle surgery and there were similar fears following a long lay-off to care for his wife two years later - but he wrote his own farewells. He retired from Tests at the SCG - his home ground - after Australia whitewashed England 5-0 in the 2006-07 Ashes and was adjudged the Man of the Tournament during Australia\'s successful World Cup campaign in 2007, his final one-day appearance. \n', ""McGrath's USP was an unremitting off-stump line and an immaculate length. He gained off-cut and bounce, specialised in the opposition's biggest wickets - especially Atherton's and Brian Lara's - and he was unafraid to back himself publicly in these key duels. He was a batting rabbit who applied himself so intently that while playing for Worcestershire he won a bet with an Australian team-mate by scoring a fifty. The hard work eventually paid off in Tests, when he made 61, then the third-highest score by a No. 11, against New Zealand in 2004-05. Only in his occasional fits of ill-temper did he fail himself. "", ""He rewrote the World Cup record-books in 2003 with 7 for 15 against the outclassed Namibians, on his way to adding another winner's medal to a bulging collection. An ankle injury threatened to derail his quest for 500 Test wickets, but after briefly contemplating retirement he bounced back with yet another five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka at Darwin in July 2004. Three months later, at Nagpur, he became the first fast bowler to play 100 matches in the baggy green, and his greatness was further confirmed when knocking down the brittle Pakistanis at Perth with 8 for 24, the second-best figures by an Australian. "", ""Adept at picking his moments, he chose the first day at Lord's to reach 500 and his subsequent ankle and arm injuries were crucial to Australia losing the Ashes in 2005. The following summer was also painfully disrupted with the recurrence of his wife Jane's cancer, which called for immediate treatment and McGrath's full attention.

His misfortune was to play alongside Shane Warne in an age when Australia, the land of Grimmett and O'Reilly, paradoxically frowned on the concept of fielding two wrist-spinners at once. After showing they could work in tandem with 13 wickets against Pakistan at Sydney in 2005, MacGill hoped - almost pleaded - for more double-act opportunities. Playing seven matches in 2005-06, he dismantled the World XI with nine victims and accepted 16 wickets in the two-game series against Bangladesh. The following season, after injuring his knee on John Buchanan's boot camp, he didn't play a Test, but encouragement came when Warne left international cricket at the end of the Ashes. At 36, MacGill, who entered the ranks of grumpy older men when a 2006-07 argument with a grade umpire led to a two-match suspension, had the most reasons to be cheerful.  \n"", 'However, he struggled on his return to the Australia side against Sri Lanka in 2007 and was diagnosed with carpal-tunnel syndrome. His wrist required surgery and despite hard-working attempts to regain his previous powers, he knew in the West Indies he was no longer a bowler of international quality. Rather than hang around, he called it quits during the second Test in Antigua. In true MacGill style he stepped down with plaudits for his fine bowling contributions, honest personal reflections and a fine for sleeping in. ', ""MacGill stayed philosophical throughout his career, eagerly running in and invariably running amok. He bewitched 53 wickets in 11 Tests during Warne's 12-month drugs ban in 2003-04, yet was maligned for bowling one boundary-ball per over; a shade unfairly, considering that was the standard "", ' for all leggies pre-Warne. A batting duffer and increasingly feckless fielder, he played only three one-day internationals, winning the Man-of-the-Match award in one of them. Unusually for a bowler, MacGill seldom smiled upon taking a wicket. Instead he let out a roar of accomplishment. ""People ask me why I don\'t smile - it\'s because it\'s really hard,"" he said in 2003-04. ""Test cricket\'s hard ... I\'ll take a wicket and there\'ll be an explosion of emotion."" It was one of MacGill\'s many quirks. ', 'He is a wine connoisseur who has hosted a pay television show called ', "", and learned later in life to enjoy the taste of beer.

But the praise lavished on his decision to boycott Zimbabwe in 2004 because of moral concerns continued an unwelcome pattern: he long generated headlines for being "", ' of the Australian team rather than for his performances ', ' it.

A photographer and author, he wrote an entertaining account of his 1899 and 1905 tour of England, "", '.\n', ' \n', ""Frank Laver, who died in Melbourne on September 24, was probably a better batsman on Australian wickets than he ever proved himself in this country. Otherwise he would hardly have secured a place in the great team that came here in 1899, as at that time he was not regarded as more than just a change bowler. During the tour he scored 859 runs, and, with ten not-outs to help him, had an average of 30, but his style of batting was so ungainly that even when he did well very little was thought of him. No serious demands were made upon him as a bowler in 1899, the side being so strong, but he came off on the last day of the Test match at Lord's, when England for the moment seemed to have a chance of making something like a fight after having been hopelessly out-played. With tempting balls on the off side he got Hayward, Tyldesley. and Jessop caught in quick succession, this surprising bit of work making Australia's victory absolutely certain."", ""In 1905 and 1909 Laver's experience were altogether different. He came over as manager in 1905, and only expected to play now and then, but circumstances forced him to the front, and for fully a month he was the best bowler in the team, his success culminating in the Test match at Nottingham, when in England's first innings he took seven wickets. After that, probably from overwork, he fell off, but he was recovering his form towards the end of the trip. A tall, powerful man, he bowled medium pace, with an excellent command of pitch, and no doubt his height helped to make the flight of the ball deceptive. English batsmen considered him a very good but not an exceptional bowler, and often wondered why they fared so badly against him. Some of them thought that on fast wickets he ought generally to have been punished as MacLaren punished him at Trent Bridge in 1905, but perhaps his bowling was not so easy to hit as it looked to be. In 1909, when Australia won the rubber of Test matches by two to one and had all the best of two drawn games, Laver headed the bowling averages with a record of seventy wickets for just under fifteen runs apiece, but he played in less than half the matches.

McDonald's six wickets cost 65 runs apiece, but he was picked for the ensuing visit to England and in the Tests he took twenty-seven wickets for 24 runs apiece."", ""In the Test at Nottingham McDonald took eight wickets for 74 and at Lord's and Leeds he was mainly responsible for the fall of England's first three wickets so cheaply that defeat became inevitable. The Australians thus won the rubber and so beat England eight times in consecutive engagements."", ""At the end of the tour McDonald decided to accept an engagement as professional with the Nelson club and in due course became qualified for Lancashire. Naturally enough, a bowler capable of such devastating work against the flower of England's batting accomplished remarkable things in county cricket and from 1924, when he was available only in mid-week matches, until 1931, when his ability suddenly declined, he took 1,040 wickets for Lancashire. In his best season, 1925, he dismissed in all matches 205 batsmen at an average cost of 18.67. During this period Lancashire won the County Championship four times. One of his best performances was at Dover in 1926 when Kent, wanting 426 to win, got within 65 of victory for the loss of five wickets. McDonald then performed the  hat-trick and Lancashire triumphed by 33 runs. In the match he took twelve wickets for 187 runs."", 'Of good height and loosely built, McDonald ran with easy grace to the crease and his rhythmical action with accurate length and off-break surprised every batsman when first facing him and often afterwards. In these particulars he was very different from Gregory with a longer, faster run and leaping delivery; but in Australian cricket the names of these two fast bowlers must be coupled as the terrific force which humiliated England in the first years of Test cricket after the War. Ordinarily of small account as a batsman, McDonald hit up a not out century in a hundred minutes against Middlesex at Old Trafford in 1926. His benefit match with Middlesex at Old Trafford in 1929 brought him nearly £2,000. After giving up County cricket, McDonald returned to the Lancashire League with the Bacup club as successor to Arthur Richardson, another Australian.

Or at least that's the perception: in a land of dashers and crashers Langer was seen as a grafter, a battler, only ever a couple of failures away from oblivion. The reality was  somewhat different. Yesteryear's ugly duckling turned into a stroke-playing swan, racking up more Test hundreds than those national treasures Doug Walters, Ian Chappell, Mark Waugh and Bill Lawry, and scoring an eye-popping 1481 runs in 2004. Always an effective cutter and driver, he indulged in unseemly crossbat hoicks from the first over. Together with his bludgeoning comrade Matthew Hayden, he screwed up textbooks and record-books alike, making Greenidge and Haynes look like strokeless stonewallers. It was a miraculous reinvention.  \n"", ""Clanged on the helmet by Ian Bishop on debut, Langer fought on to make 54, but played only eight Tests in six years. He returned at No. 3, as the selectors sought to mould him into the next David Boon - and for a while he exceeded even those lofty ambitions. After rescuing the unrescuable Hobart Test of 1999-2000 with Adam Gilchrist, then slaughtering a blistering 122 in Auckland, Steve Waugh called him the world's best batsman. The feeling was mutual; Langer's devotion to Waugh saw him nicknamed 'Mini-Tugga' alongside `JL' and `Alfie'. His bond with Hayden was even closer. The pair missed each other when they were apart, exchanged bear hugs in the middle, and gave the impression always of two boys living out a dream. "", ""Langer may be short of stature but he is tall in enthusiasm (he's already written two books) and boasts a black belt in taekwondo. His strong-willed performances were a highlight in a batting line-up that failed to fire against England in 2005, and with 394 runs at 43.77 he was Australia's leading scorer. He also took blows to the helmet and body, which are a common theme of his career. In a season disrupted by a cracked rib and a hamstring problem, Langer's 100th Test was delayed until the final match against South Africa in Johannesburg, where he turned into a Makhaya Ntini bouncer before scoring a run. Taken to hospital with a head cut and concussion, he spent the rest of the game in the hotel or dressing room and considered quitting altogether before placing the option below regaining the Ashes, and once that goal was achieved, he joined Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath in bowing out at the end of the series."", 'He played only eight one-day internationals, something that bugged him no end, despite a Gilchristian strike rate of 88.88.

McDermott was not as fiery as his red hair suggested, nor did he capture the public imagination in the manner of Dennis Lillee or Shane Warne, but he was a textbook outswing bowler with a classic side-on action who could run through any batting order on his day. He was also a thumping batsman in his youth. Like all self-respecting Aussies, he saved his best for England, with 84 wickets in 17 Tests, including two eight-fors and eight of his 14 five-fors. His best performance was probably at Perth in 1990-91, when he took 8 for 97 as England collapsed from 191 for 2 to 244 all out. Injuries hit McDermott again towards the end of his career: he missed the best part of the 1993 Ashes tour, as well as the famous victory in the Caribbean in 1994-95 and the World Cup a year later. \n"", ""After his playing days, McDermott returned to cricket in a coaching capacity, but not before enduring tough times off the field, as the failure of his real-estate business caused him to sell his home and declare bankruptcy. McDermott returned to cricket in late 2009, in a part-time capacity with Australia's Centre of Excellence. There he worked with several young Australian fast bowlers, including James Pattinson, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, and was thus the best qualified to take over from Troy Cooley as Australia's bowling coach. McDermott took over that role in May 2011, and during his year charge the team, and especially their fast bowlers, achieved some fine results, including an utterly dominant performance in the home series against India. McDermott quit from his role as bowling coach in May 2012, citing the team's busy overseas schedule as the primary reason. \n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1986'],71.0,90,13,940.0,42*,12.2,1716,54.77,0,0,90,6,19.0,0.0,138.0,78,17,432.0,37,7.08,492,87.80,0,0,36,8,27.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,174.0,210,35,2856,74,16.32,,,0,7,,,53.0,0.0,176.0,97,23,594,41,8.02,,,0,0,,,32.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71.0,124,16586,8332,291.0,8/97,11/157,28.63,3.01,56.9,17,14,2,138.0,138,7461,5018,203.0,5/44,5/44,24.71,4.03,36.7,4,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,174.0,,36785,19025,677,8/44,,28.10,3.10,54.3,,37,4,176.0,,9416,6212,254,5/44,5/44,24.45,3.95,37.0,7,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Short in stature but of strong build, he was as a right-handed batsman most adept square of the wicket, either with wristy cuts or vigorous hooks, and there were few better players of spin bowling on a difficult pitch. His own spin bowling, a clever mixture of leg-breaks and googlies, had lost something in accuracy by the time he played for Somerset, and English wickets did not always give him the bounce which encourages his type abroad, but in his expansively flighted deliveries and the mystery of the turn came a manifestation of an art that was to disappear from English grounds. He was also a fine slip fielder. \nAlthough he played seven times for his home state of New South Wales before war service with the RAAF, it was with Queensland that he caught the attention of the Australian selectors in 1945-46 with six for 36 against New South Wales, and seven for 106 and 172 as he ""scattered the field by carefree batting"" at Adelaide, and four for 102 and seven for 74 against the Australian Services. His 172 against South Australia remained the highest score of his career. Taken to New Zealand for the first-ever Test between the two countries, he scored 7 and, put on to bowl at the end, produced figures of 0.2-0-0-1 as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs. \nIn 1946-47, after taking sixteen wickets against Hammond\'s MCC side before the first Test, he was especially successful in the series. At Brisbane, on the second evening, he attacked the subdued England bowling to reach 92 not out, but resuming after the rest day he added only 3 more runs before playing back to Wright and being lbw. At Sydney, he took eight wickets, including five for 109, and at Melbourne, hooking and driving with absolute confidence, he scored an unbeaten 104 after going in with Yardley on a hat-trick and Australia 188 for five. Five for 44 in the second innings of the final Test, again at Sydney, saw him finish the series with eighteen wickets at 27.27, Australia\'s leading wicket-taker with Lindwall, and he scored 272 runs with an average of 54.50.  \n', ""He did little in his three Tests against India the next season, and his thirteen wickets in the Sheffield Shield cost 48.61 each, but he went to England with Bradman's team in 1948. However, with a new ball available after 55 overs and a formidable attack waiting to use it, there was no place for McCool in the Test side. He was, moreover, handicapped by a worn spinning finger, a legacy of his triumphs in 1946-47, which blistered and continually bled, and while he ended with 57 wickets at 17.82, he did not reach his best until late in the tour. In South Africa in 1949-50 he again took 50 wickets, as well as scoring 438 runs, and he played in all five Tests, his five for 41 at Cape Town being his best return in a Test match. "", 'But in 1950-51, although he was the leading wicket-taker in the Shield that season, he did not get a Test against England; nor against West Indies the following season. By choosing to play as a professional for East Lancashire in the leagues, he precluded the possibility of selection for the Australians to England in 1953 and at 37 his Test career was over. He had scored, in his fourteen appearances, 459 runs with an average of 35.50, taken 36 wickets at 26.61 and held fourteen catches. ', ""McCool was 40 when he began his career with Somerset and his talents and his influence were apparent from the start. He failed by 34 runs to reach 2,000 runs and after four seasons at the foot of the table, Somerset finished fifteenth in the Championship. Against Johnson's Australians at Taunton, he scored 90 and then 116 in 95 minutes, one of his three hundreds that year. Next season, with another Australian, Bill Alley, also on the staff, Somerset climbed to eighth, and in 1958 they won twelve games and were third: their best season ever. His 1,590 runs that year included his highest score for the county, 169 against Worcestershire at Stourbridge, and the best bowling of his career, eight for 74 on a sporting pitch at Trent Bridge.

His form for the State was such that he earned a place in  W. M.

In  1931-32 he enjoyed remarkable success in his three innings for  New South Wales, scores of 229 not out against  Queensland at  Brisbane and 106 and 103 not out from the  Victoria bowling at  Sydney giving him the phenomenal Sheffield Shield average of 438.

His 187 not out in the first match of the series at  Sydney was a remarkable exhibition of both craftsmanship and courage. He made his runs out of 278 in less than four and three-quarter hours, after his earlier colleagues failed, with twenty-five 4s among his figures. His hooking of short-pitched deliveries by  H. Larwood and  W. Voce, the  Nottinghamshire pair, was something which will for ever hold a place in Australian cricket history. In  England again in  1934, he put together eight centuries -- more than any of his team-mates -  including 240, the highest of his career, against  Surrey at  The Oval and 137 in the third Test at  Old Trafford. As "", ' of the time said of him:  He blossomed forth as an almost completely equipped batsman of the forcing type and was probably the best exponent -- Bradman himself scarcely excluded -- of the art of hitting the ball tremendously hard and safely.', 'Next season at home he became captain of  New South Wales and on tour in  South Africa in  1935-36 he enjoyed more success, heading the Test batting figures with 420 runs, average 84. He hit 149 in the first test at Durban, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 161 with  W. A. Brown, and 189 not out in the second meeting with  South Africa at  Johannesburg, where he and  J. H. Fingleton put on 177 together. At  Johannesburg he showed his fast-scoring ability to the full by reaching 50 in forty-two minutes.', ""Perhaps  McCabe's most famous innings was his 232 not out in the opening Test against  England at Trent Bridge in  1938 which, scored at the rate of one a minute, prompted  Sir Donald Bradman, his captain, to greet him on his return to the pavilion with the words:  If I could play an innings like that, I'd be a proud man, Stan."", 'S. C. Griffith, Secretary of  M.C.C., commented upon this innings when paying a tribute to  McCabe, calling it one of the best batting displays ever seen.   McCabe was a very great cricketer and a wonderful friend to all cricketers, said Mr.  Griffith.', 'Other tributes included:', 'Sir Robert Menzies, former Prime Minister of Australia:  One of his great points was that he never bothered about averages; he enjoyed his batting. He was one of the two or three greatest batsman I ever saw.', ""Sir Leonard Hutton: I knew him well. It would be hard to think of a greater Australian batsman. He had qualities that even  Bradman hadn't got.

Daring and confident, he possessed a quickness of eye, hand and foot, a perfection of timing which made him a menace to the best of bowlers. Sydney H. Pardon, then Editor of ', ', wrote of him in 1921 as a law to himself--an individual genius, but not in any way to be copied. He constantly did things that would be quite wrong for an ordinary batsman, but by success justified all his audacities. Except Victor Trumper at his best, no Australian batsman has ever demoralised our bowlers to the same extent. \n', ""Of medium height and stocky build, The Governor-General, as MacArtney came to be known, was specially good in cutting and hitting to leg, though there was no stroke, orthodox or unorthodox, of which he did not show himself master. Intolerant of batsmen who did not treat bowling upon its merits, he was quoted as giving, not long before his death, as the reason why he had ceased to be a regular cricket spectator: I can't bear watching luscious half-volleys being nudged gently back to bowlers. Yet in regard to his own achievements this man with the Napoleonic features could not have been more modest; he had no regard at all for records or averages, nor was he ever known to complain about an umpire's decision."", ""How punishing a batsman he could be was never more fully demonstrated than in 1921 when, at Trent Bridge, he took such full advantage of a missed chance when nine that he reached 345 from the Nottinghamshire bowling in less than four hours with four 6's and forty-seven 4's among his figures. This still stands as the highest innings put together by an Australian in England and, furthermore, no other batsman in first-class cricket has scored as many runs in a single day. It was also the third of four centuries in following innings, the others being 105 v. Hampshire at Southampton, 193 v. Northamptonshire at Northampton and 115 v. England at Leeds, where he performed the rare feat of getting to three figures before lunch."", 'From the time that he made his first appearance for Australia in 1907 till he ended his Test career in 1926, MacArtney represented his country 35 times, scoring 2,132 runs, including seven centuries, average 41.80. His highest Test innings was 170 against England at Sydney in 1920-21. He headed the Australia averages with 86.66 that season and also figured at the top in England in 1926 when, with the aid of innings of 151, 133 not out and 109, his average was 94.60. He took part in twelve Test partnerships of 100 or more, the biggest being 235 with W. M. Woodfull for the second wicket against England at Leeds in 1926.', 'For all the batting prowess he revealed later, it was as a slow left-arm bowler that MacArtney did his best work when first visiting England in 1909. During the tour he took 71 wickets at a cost of 17.46 runs each, and he played a big part in the overthrow of England at Leeds by dismissing seven batsmen for 58 runs in the first innings and four for 27 in the second. In an unofficial Australian tour of America in 1913, his ability as an all-rounder reached such heights that he hit 2,390 runs and took 180 wickets, finishing at the top of both sets of averages. As a fieldsman, particularly at mid-off, he had few equals.', 'He accomplished much fine work for New South Wales, for whom he first played in 1905, scoring 2,443 runs, average 42.12, with 201 against Victoria in 1913-14 his highest innings. Twice he got two separate centuries in a match--119 and 126 for his State against the South Africans in 1910-11 and 142 and 121 for the Australians against Sussex at Hove in 1912. In all cricket his runs numbered 15,003, average 45.87, and he hit 48 hundreds.', 'Of him, Sir Jack Hobbs said: I saw him begin his Test career in Australia and we thought him a very unorthodox player, but we soon realised he was brilliant. He hit particularly hard through the covers and frequently cut even fast bowlers off his stumps. He certainly had a wonderful eye. He was a charming fellow and a highly confident cricketer.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1922'],35.0,55,4,2131.0,170,41.78,,,7,9,,3,17.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,249.0,360,32,15019,345,45.78,,,49,53,,,102.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35.0,45,3561,1240,45.0,7/58,11/85,27.55,2.08,79.1,1,2,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,249.0,,24228,8782,419,7/58,,20.95,2.17,57.8,,17,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He had impressed the selectors with his ability to prosper on difficult pitches - his offspin also helped his cause - and it was just reward for one of Western Australia's most reliable performers. Having started with a vital 117 as Australia's batsmen struggled in the opening match, he scored another 38 runs in three innings and picked up two wickets to show his part-time bowling value. Instead of appearing in the third Test, he spent the opening day sick in hospital, but stayed for the one-day series when Adam Voges pulled out. He also went to the United Arab Emirates via Hampshire to cover for Shaun Marsh, failing twice in the ODIs against Pakistan.  \n"", 'The 2009 Ashes was the series for his most accomplished performances at Test level, which included an unbeaten 125 in Cardiff and back-to-back returns of 96 and 110 in Birmingham and Leeds. He also had five scores of 12 or less to highlight his strange hit-and-miss tendency, and his life was made harder by being the main spinner in the decider at The Oval. Back in Australia for his first local Test experience, North was soon struggling and his position was in doubt after only 207 runs in six Tests against West Indies and Pakistan. ', 'Under immense pressure, he went to New Zealand, immediately fixed a damaging technical glitch and picked up 112, 9 and 90 in the two-Test series. ""It was a pretty defining couple of innings for my career,"" he said. However, he faltered again with the bat in the series against Pakistan in England, although he managed to get on the honour boards at Lord\'s with 6 for 55 in the second innings. ', ""A well-organised left-hander, North was afflicted by a casual attitude in his initial seasons with Western Australia as he made the transition from decorated youth player to senior squad member. He had significant success at under-age level, having been a member of several Academy and national junior sides and an elite scholar in 1998. He is particularly well remembered for a remarkable double of 200 and 134 at Sheikhupura during an Australian Youth team's tour of Pakistan in early 1997. His debut at first-class level came in 1998-99 on an Academy tour of Zimbabwe, and he quickly showcased his potential upon his elevation to senior interstate ranks the following season, hitting a brave 60 to help his team to a tense win over South Australia. "", ""For several years he rode an outstanding form streak, which began in 2003-04 with 984 runs in the Pura Cup and a century against Zimbabwe for Australia A. He followed with Pura Cup tallies of 826, 712 and 680 before a knee problem struck. Often a dangerous one-day player as well, North blasted 115 from 85 balls in a limited-overs game against Tasmania in 2006-07. North's special talents were recognised by Western Australia when he was handed the state's captaincy for 2007-08, only to miss much of the season with a degenerative knee condition. It was January before he could actually take up the on-field leadership and his Pura Cup campaign was limited to 184 runs at 26.28 from four games.

He excelled as a batsman, bowler, fieldsman and captain, notably in placing his field to block a batsman's favourite strokes. Born in Sydney on January 28, 1873, Noble made a name in junior cricket and went to New Zealand with a New South Wales team in 1893, while in the following season he scored 152 not out for Sydney Juniors' Eighteen against A. E. Stoddart's team. That performance secured Noble a trial in the New South Wales eleven, and he gradually established himself as a cricketer of outstanding merit. Playing in four Tests in the 1897-98 season, when Stoddart's second team gained only one victory, Noble had the best bowling average on either side, and he remained a notable figure in Australian cricket until 1920, when he retired, having scored 14,245 runs and taken 654 wickets in first-class matches. \n"", 'Already mature on first coming to England in 1899, when 26 years of age, he brought a reputation which he upheld at once with an innings of 116 not out against South of England at the Crystal Palace. The bowlers whom he faced included Lockwood, C. L. Townsend, Brockwell, J. R. Mason and W. G. Grace. From that highly favourable beginning he rose to the accomplishment of bigger and more important deeds at the expense of English cricketers during that and three subsequent tours. Showing versatility as demanded by the strength of the attack to which he was opposed, he varied his methods according to the needs of the occasion. His patience equalled his skill in defence, while at times he used his height and reach with full effect in driving, pulling, forcing the ball off his legs, and cutting either square or late -- a batsman of rare style and execution without any sign of weakness.', 'From start to finish of the 1899 tour Noble enjoyed exceptional success with the bat, impressing English critics chiefly by his self-control and indifference to fatigue after long spells at the crease. On English wickets he could not play forward with the same degree of safety as in Australia, and the necessity of watching the ball more closely from the pitch involved a considerable change in his methods. Concentrating on this, he triumphed at Manchester in the fourth Test Match; scoring 60 not out and 89, he withstood the England bowling for eight and a half hours. Noble did not get a run during three-quarters of an hour in his second innings, which lasted five hours twenty minutes, his prolonged effort contributing largely towards Australia avoiding defeat. In this way he atoned for complete failure at Leeds, where he was the first victim to J. T. Hearne in the only hat-trick performance in England in matches with Australia.', 'Noble again was the best all-rounder in the second team captained by Joe Darling. During this 1902 tour he made his highest score in England -- 284 at Hove against Sussex, he and Warwick Armstrong putting on 428, then a world record, for the sixth wicket. He stood out among his colleagues with 1,416 runs, average 32.93, next to Victor Trumper, and 98 wickets at less than 20 runs apiece, Hugh Trumble and J. V. Saunders being more effective with the ball. That was the tour in which Australia became sure of the rubber by a three runs victory at Old Trafford, while England in an equally dramatic finish won by one wicket at The Oval.', 'Three years later Darling lost the toss to F. S. Jackson, now Sir Stanley, in all five Tests, and England carried off the honours with two victories in the only decisive games. Noble obtained most runs -- 2,084 in the tour, average 44.34 -- but his bowling showed deterioration in a return of 59 wickets, and he did comparatively little in the representative matches.', ""Under Noble's lead, Australia had lost the 1903-04 series to P. F. Warner's side, but recovered The Ashes with a triumph over the touring team captained by A. O. Jones, and maintained the supremacy in 1909, when Noble, captain of Australia for the third time, proved himself a courageous and enterprising commander by his control of the side. After an indifferent start, two defeats being suffered before England won at Birmingham, the Australians feared an unsuccessful tour."", ""Then came a great example of bold, shrewd tactics. Winning the toss at Lord's, Noble gave England first innings under favourable batting conditions, and his enterprising venture upset a badly chosen eleven. The England batting was poor, catches were dropped, and Noble practically settled the issue by bowling A. C. MacLaren, his rival captain, with an astonishing break-back in the second innings. Australia won by nine wickets, and from that point all went well."", ""Victory followed at Leeds, while the remaining Tests, at Manchester and The Oval, were drawn. Noble equalled Jackson's good fortune in winning the toss in all the Tests, so enjoying that personal satisfaction, besides seeing his side retain the ascendancy secured when he led Australia for the second time against an England visiting team. His strategy at Lord's, where astute perception could sense unrest in the rival camp and prompt a breakaway from the accepted custom of seizing the gift of the gods by batting first, the feat of Warren Bardsley in scoring 136 and 130 at The Oval, and his own successful calling in the toss made that series of Tests historic."", 'No doubt the cares of leadership affected Noble as a player, his 1,109 runs, average 25.79, and 25 wickets at 37.12 each suggesting a decline of skill with both bat and ball; but never can a captain have felt more pleased with the full results of his visit to England. In this way Noble concluded his service as captain of Australia with eight Test victories to his credit to set against five defeats.', 'His most notable bowling performance for Australia against England was at Melbourne in January 1902. In the first innings of the very strong team captained by A. C. MacLaren he dismissed seven men for only 17 runs, and six in the second innings at 10 runs apiece -- 13 wickets in the match at the very small cost of 77 runs.', 'Figures prove that there has not been a superior all-round Test player. In 39 matches against England, Noble scored 1,905 runs, average 30.72, and took 115 wickets, average 24.78; George Giffen in 31 matches scored 1,238 runs and took 103 wickets; Wilfred Rhodes in 41 matches scored 1,706 runs and took 109 wickets -- these are the only three performers of the double in Test cricket.', ""Such facts show Noble's capacity for rising to the occasion, for during his four tours in England he did not once dismiss a hundred batsmen in a season, whereas George Giffen and Warwick Armstrong each accomplished the double three times. J. M. Gregory did this twice; G. E. Palmer, in 1886, H. Trumble, in 1899, and H. L. Collins, in 1919, once each."", 'Noble always maintained his connection with the Paddington club, and his association of over thirty years with this leading Sydney grade team was celebrated in April 1924 by a banquet in his honour. His record in first-grade matches was given as more than 10,000 runs and 600 wickets. In 1898-99 he had the remarkable average of 273, and in the 1910-11 season 128.80. After his successful captaincy against England, a Testimonial match was played at Sydney in March 1908. He scored 87, and his partnership of 192 for the seventh wicket with S. E. Gregory made the way for an innings victory for his Test eleven over the Rest of Australia. He also took four wickets. The testimonial Fund exceeded £2,000.', 'Unable to continue a banking career when occupied so much with first-class cricket, Noble qualified in dentistry. As a lecturer on cricket he gained wide popularity in Australia, and his book, ', ', gave graphic descriptions of events that happened in the 1924-25 season.', 'Of 37 three-figure innings played by Noble in first-class cricket the best were:']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1900'],42.0,73,7,1997.0,133,30.25,,,1,16,,,26.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,248.0,377,34,13975,284,40.74,,,37,66,,,187.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.0,71,7159,3025,121.0,7/17,13/77,25.0,2.53,59.1,1,9,2,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,248.0,,33112,14443,624,8/48,,23.14,2.61,53.0,,33,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,False,False,True

Bill  Tiger O'Reilly was unquestionably one of cricket's great figures: as a player, as a character and later as a writer on the game. His cricket was proof that spin bowling was not necessarily a gentle art. He was 6ft 2in tall, gripped the ball in his enormous right hand and released it at a pace that could be almost fast-medium. It would then bounce ferociously on the hard pitches of his time and, on occasion, knock wicket-keepers off their feet. He bowled leg-breaks and, especially, top-spinners and googlies, backed up by an intimidating manner. Jack Fingleton said he was  a flurry of limbs, fire and steel-edged temper. It has been suggested that his action and the general commotion before delivery were born of a deep sense of frustration at not being able to bowl fast enough to knock the batsman down. Off the field, his gruffness was mitigated by his intelligence, erudition, wit and twinkling eyes."", ""He played 27 Test matches and took 144 wickets - 102 of them Englishmen and the vital wicket of Walter Hammond ten times - averaging 22.59. But his figures have to be judged by the fact that all but one of his Tests came in the 1930s, when other bowlers were dominated by batsmen to an unprecedented extent. No one ever dominated  O'Reilly. Even when  England made 903 at  The Oval in  1938, he bowled 85 overs and finished with figures of three for 178. And before that, he had secured the Ashes by taking five for 66 and five for 56 at  Headingley."", "" O'Reilly was born in White Cliffs in the New South Wales bush into a large Irish family on December 20, 1905. His father was a small-town schoolmaster and young Bill was above average at several sports, including tennis, athletics and rugby. Cricket was harder to arrange. According to Jack Fingleton in "", "", the four  O'Reilly brothers played with a gum-wood bat and a piece of banksia root chiselled down to make a ball. Since the others were older, Bill inevitably bowled more than he batted. The brothers also cuffed him a lot, possibly because he was starting to show them up. In 1917 the family moved to Wingello. When he played his first match for Wingello Juniors, the team walked to the opposition's ground seven miles away in Tallong, with their dogs chasing rabbits along the way. In 1919, he went to the high school in the larger town of Goulburn, where he concentrated on his athletics as much as his cricket. And when he went to the teachers' college at Sydney University in his late teens he was more interested in such events as the hop, step and jump, in which he held the state record. According to  Fingleton's account he would probably have been lost to cricket had he not been asked to make up the numbers in a Sydney junior match and, with a method that at first made everyone giggle, whipped out the opposition."", ""In the summer of  1925-26, the young  O'Reilly, by now an undergraduate at the teachers' college in Sydney University, met the man whose destiny was to be linked with his for ever.  O'Reilly's own account of this remains a classic. He was passing through Bowral Station on his way home to Wingello for his summer holiday when he heard his name being called down the platform. He put his head out of the carriage window and was told to get out at once: Wingello were playing at Bowral and needed him."", "" How was I to know that I was about to cross swords with the greatest cricketer that ever set foot on a cricket field ? He didn't have it all his own way, let me tell you. Well, not for the first couple of overs, anyway. By the close of play, 17-year-old  Don Bradman was 234 not out. The match resumed a week later, according to the local custom.  The sun shone, the birds sang sweetly and the flowers bloomed as never before. I bowled him first ball with a  leg-break which came from the leg stump to hit the off bail. Suddenly cricket was the best game in the whole wide world."", ""In  1926-27 O'Reilly was chosen for the  New South Wales state practice squad on the strength of one match for North Sydney. A year later he made his first-class début against the  New Zealanders. But teachers in New South Wales work for the state rather than an individual school and the newly-qualified  O'Reilly was despatched to three different bush towns. This may have cost him the chance of a Test against  England in  1928-29 and, very probably, a tour in 1930. He was transferred back to  Sydney in time for the  1931-32 season and after four more matches made his début for  Australia. He performed quietly in a match in which  Bradman scored 299 not out and  Grimmett took 14 wickets, but he had arrived."", 'In the  1932-33 Bodyline series he took 27 wickets, without anyone noticing much, given what else was happening. In the series in  England in  1934 he took 28 wickets, including seven in an innings twice. At  Trent Bridge he won the match with seven for 54, achieved by what ', "" called  clever variation in flight and pace combined with spin off the worn turf. In blazing heat at  Old Trafford, he transformed the game in an over which  England began at 68 for no wicket.  Walters was  caught at  forward short leg off the first ball,  Wyatt bowled middle stump by the second and  Hammond, after glancing a four off the third, was  bowled by the fourth.  Hendren and  Leyland recaptured the initiative and  England declared at 627 for nine but  O'Reilly finished with seven for 189. He took 109 wickets on the tour, including nine for 38 against  Somerset. He went back to Australia and suddenly announced his retirement. He had married in 1933, had a daughter and was anxious about his teaching career. However, Sydney Grammar School offered him a job that enabled him to play on. He toured  South Africa in  1935-36 and took 27 wickets again, 25 in the great series against  England in  1936-37 and 22 back in  England in  1938, despite the unforgiving wickets ( dosed up to the eyeballs, said  O'Reilly) of  Trent Bridge and  The Oval."", ""He played only one more Test, the one-off game against  New Zealand at  Wellington in March  1946 when he was already 40. The opposition barely beat his age: they were bowled out for 42 and 54 and  O'Reilly took five for 14 and three for 19. It was the 11th time he had taken five in an innings in Tests.  O'Reilly then began writing on cricket for the "", "" with a muscular, very Australian prose style flavoured with wit and imagery (You can smell the gum-leaves off him, he wrote of one country boy just starting with  Queensland). Until he finally retired in 1988, he was as revered in Australian press boxes as he had been on the field. His opinions often came more from the heart than the head, especially if it was a question of attacking the selectors for playing safe and ignoring a young player, most especially a young leg-spinner. But he was consistent, loved quality and hated  one-day cricket (hit-and-giggle) which he generally refused to watch. He was hot-blooded and humorous which perhaps explains why his relationship with the cooler  Bradman is believed to have been based on intense mutual respect rather than the profoundest form of Australian mateship. While Sir Donald walked the corridors of cricketing power  O'Reilly was the rumbustious backbencher."", ""His last few years were rendered miserable by illness, including the loss of a leg. But he was blessed with a marriage to Molly that lasted 59 years. In his career he took 774 wickets at 16.60 and was successful at every level: playing for North Sydney and St George, he topped the Sydney Grade averages 12 times and took 962 wickets at 9.44. He took a wicket every 49 balls in his first-class career and it was said he never bowled a wide. His batting was left-handed, hard-hitting and occasionally stubborn (1,655 runs at 13.13); he never quite forgave himself for getting out at  Lord's in  1934 when he might have saved the follow-on, in which case he rather than  Verity would have had use of a rain-affected wicket. He did save the follow-on by making 30 not out at  Old Trafford in the next Test. Future generations will have to judge the greatness of his bowling on the fragments of film that survive and the written descriptions, of which R. C. Robertson-Glasgow's may stand as definitive:"", ""As with those more florid opponents of legendary heroes, there seemed to be more arms than Nature or the rules allow. During the run-up, a sort of fierce galumph, the right forearm worked like a piston; at delivery the head was ducked low as if to butt the batsman on to his stumps. But it didn't take long to see the greatness; the control of  leg-break,  top-spinner and  googly; the change of pace and trajectory without apparent change in action; the scrupulous length; the vitality; and, informing and rounding all, the brain to diagnose what patient required what treatment."", ""When  O'Reilly died,  Bradman said he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched.\n""]","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1935', 'Australian Cricket Hall of Fame 1996']",27.0,39,7,410.0,56*,12.81,,,0,1,,11,7.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,135.0,167,41,1655,56*,13.13,,,0,1,,,65.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27.0,48,10024,3254,144.0,7/54,11/129,22.59,1.94,69.6,8,11,3,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,135.0,,37064,12850,774,9/38,,16.60,2.08,47.8,,63,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

October 19, 1900, North Fitzroy, Melbourne, Victoria ","April 6, 1991, Kyneton, Victoria (aged 90 years 169 days) ",,"['Australia,', 'Victoria']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"['\n', ""\nBill Ponsford, died at Kyneton, Victoria, on April 6, 1991; at 90, he was Australia's oldest living Test cricketer and the sole survivor of HL Collins's 1926 team in England. He made 162 in his second first-class game, for Victoria against Tasmania at Launceston in February 1922, but did not play for the state again until selected against the same opposition a year later in Melbourne. Then, in what was only his fourth innings, he created a sensation by hitting 429 in 477 minutes: it was the world's highest first-class score until he bettered it five years later. Furthermore, Victoria's 1059 was the first four-figure total in any first-class match, and Ponsford, who was captaining the side, stayed until he made the 1000th run himself, having gone in at 200 for three. \n"", 'He was soon to prove that his 429 was something more than money for old rope against moderate bowling, as some would have it. The previous record-holder, AC MacLaren, had protested peevishly at the status of the match. Four centuries for Victoria in 1923-24, including 248 out of 456 with Edgar Mayne for the first wicket against Queensland - still an Australian record - sounded a warning note of what was in store for bowlers. The next season he played in all five Tests against England and scored 110 and 128 in the first two, an unprecedented achievement. His tour of England in 1926 was less successful, but early in December a veritable torrent of runs began to flow from his bat. Never before had anyone strung together such a series of colossal scores as Ponsford did in 1926-27 and 1927-28. In 1926-27, his innings were 214 and 54, 151, 352, 108 and 84, 12 and 116, 131 and 7, producing an aggregate of 1229 runs at 122.90; in 1927-28 he scored 133, 437, 202 and 38, 336, 6 and 2, and 63 - an aggregate of 1217 at 152.12. His 336 against South Australia in January 1928 was his eleventh first-class hundred in consecutive matches in Australia.', ""Only phenomenal powers of concentration, a high degree of physical fitness and an insatiable appetite for runs could have sustained him through so many hours at the crease. Over Christmas in 1926, Ponsford was in especially devastating form. On the second day of Victoria's match against New South Wales at Melbourne, he dominated an opening partnership of 375 with Woodfull, and his 352, of which 334 were made in a day, contained 36 fours. It was the foundation of Victoria's 1107, still the first-class total. But in reviewing 1927-28 the gods must have deemed Ponsford guilty of hubris, after he had the temerity to amass 1013 runs in only four innings. Nemesis was soon to follow: his new world-record score of 437, made in 621 minutes against Queensland at Melbourne, was eclipsed two years later by the young Bradman's 452 not out."", ""Ponsford, who was born in the Melbourne suburb of North Fitzroy, showed an unusual aptitude for cricket from his earliest years, taking as his model Les Cody, the state player, whose strokeplay he greatly admired. Pennant cricket for the St Kilda club led on to his first-class debut for Victoria in 1920-21, against Douglas's MCC side. A baseball batter's strength of forearm and wrist enabled him to wield a very heavy bat, and if never exactly a stylist, Ponsford soon developed into a formidable allround batsman, with great strength on the on side. He was a fierce driver in front of the wicket and always worked hard to keep up the momentum of an innings; his two quadruple centuries each contained 42 fours. He was second to none as a player of spin bowling, and O'Reilly reckoned him to be an even tougher opponent than Bradman to bowl at. Against high pace he was less secure, and when facing left-armers like Voce and Quinn, the South African, he at times showed a tendency to move too far across his wicket."", ""The difference between Ponsford's career and Test averages in 17 runs. In his first and last series, those of 1924-25 and 1934 against England, he made nearly half of his total of Test runs for an average of 64.81, whereas in his other six series he made his runs at under 40. This calls for an explanation. Although a member of the supporting cast in England in 1930, Ponsford played two fine innings - 81 at Lord's and 110 at The Oval; and in 1930-31 he took heavy toll of the West Indies attack, just pipping Bradman in the averages. But in his other three series against England, the rhythm and progress of his Test career was disrupted by illness, injury and Bodyline. In 1926, his first tour of England was ruined by an attack of tonsillitis, which kept him out of action for the whole of June. He played in the last two Tests without success. Two years later, in 1928-29, a ball from Larwood broke a bone in his hand in the second Test, at Sydney, after the same bowler had dismissed him for 2 and 6 at Brisbane. In 1932-33 he never flinched when under fire, and staying in line he absorbed a lot of punishment in putting together a brave and skilful 85 at Adelaide in the third Test."", ""By the time he arrived in England on his third tour, in 1934, Ponsford was due for a change of fortune. Unbeaten double-hundreds at Cambridge and Lord's suggested that the gods might be relenting at last, and when Ponsford and Bradman joined forces at Headingley in the fourth Test, putting on 388 for the fourth wicket, Ponsford's play was seen to be not one whit inferior to Bradman's. Neville Cardus, rhapsodising in characteristic fashion, saw the two champions as soloists in some grand double concerto. England were overwhelmed, but the damage done to them at The Oval was even worse. In a partnership surpassed in Tests only two months before Ponsford's death, by AH Jones and MD Crowe, he and Bradman added 451 for the second wicket in a mere 316 minutes. Ponsford's personal contributions in those two Tests were 181 and 266. He topped the Test averages with 569 runs at 94.83 and was one of "", ' Five Cricketers of the Year. Above all, he had shown the English public what he could do, whereupon he deemed it appropriate to retire from first-class cricket when still only 34.', 'Ponsford is the only player to have exceeded 400 twice. He and Hammond, apart from Bradman who made six, are the only players to have hit four triple-centuries, and his 281 not out against MCC at Lord\'s in 1934 is the highest score by an Australian on the ground. He shared in five partnerships of 375 or more; with Woodfull, whose career record so closely matched his own, he put together 23 three-figure partnerships, eighteen of them for the first wicket and twelve over 150. In 162 first-class matches, he scored 13,819 runs at 65.18, an average only Bradman and Merchant have bettered among batsmen with more than 10,000 runs, and he hit 47 hundreds. In the Sheffield Shield his runs totalled 5413 at 83.27, and in 29 Tests he made 2122 runs for an average of 48.23. A superb outfielder in any position, he had 71 catches to his credit - although, when examined for war service, he was found to be red-green colour-blind. ""Ponny"" was a man of few words outside the dressing-room: shy, modest and shunning publicity at all costs. When he was postered in Sydney in 1928 after his extraordinary four-innings sequence, it must have given him nightmares; the flow of runs suddenly stopped.

It takes an extremely critical eye to diminish his run-scoring achievements, which seem to collect new records in every series. Like spotting a celebrity, it's necessary to look twice when analysing Ponting, first as the archetypal modern batsman, then as the country's 42nd Test captain. There is no doubt about his greatness after taking guard, but his leadership has been under scrutiny for much of his reign. While his blade has sparkled, his stewardship is pock-marked by three  Ashes defeats - two in England and one at home - and stumbles to South Africa and India.  \n"", ""Those results didn't stop him from becoming the most successful captain in Test history after passing Steve Waugh's 41 wins in the 2009-10 Boxing Day Test. In the same match he overtook Shane Warne's 92 victories as the most by an individual, and he led Australia to 26 consecutive undefeated (completed) World Cup games. He stepped down from the captaincy when that run ended, in the 2011 World Cup. For the first three years of his reign he was in charge of a superstar unit and did not have to decide much tactically, but once that group headed for retirement he had to change from a manager to moulder. "", ""As a batsman the only debate is where to rank him in the high reaches of the game's greatest run-makers. Acclaimed by Academy coach Rod Marsh as the best teenage batsman he had ever seen, Ponting began with Tasmania at 17 and Australia at 20, and was given out unluckily for 96 on his Test debut. There were some teething problems, including a public admission of an alcohol problem, but the longer he went on the more he matured, building up records and runs. "", ""He plays all the shots with a full flourish of the bat - the cover drive and the pull are particularly productive methods - and knows only to attack. His breathtaking, dead-eye fielding is a force in the game by itself. Only Sachin Tendulkar has more centuries in Tests and ODIs combined than Ponting, who is a natural in the game's traditional forms, but resistant to the perks of Twenty20, from which he retired from in 2009. There have been setbacks against probing seam attacks, high-class finger-spin and, latterly, short balls, which he insists are meant to be pulled or hooked.

A corporal in the 15th Field Ambulance, 15th Brigade, he was buried for several hours during the heavy bombardment of Polygon Wood in 1918 and was barely alive when rescued. \n', 'His great opportunity came in 1919 when the Australian Imperial Forces team (AIF) was touring England. Ted Long, the AIF wicketkeeper, had been injured, and C Kelleway needed a replacement for the match against Oxford University. Oldfield, who had been keeping wicket for the second of the two AIF elevens, was called upon, and he seized the opportunity with both hands.', 'He had learnt his cricket at Cleveland Street school in Sydney, where he showed promise both as a batsman and as a bowler. On leaving school he took up wicketkeeping, playing for Glebe in Sydney club cricket. In this match against Oxford, on May 29 and 30, 1919, Kelleway saw that here was a great wicketkeeper in the making, and Oldfield continued playing with the first eleven of the AIF, sharing the wicketkeeping with Long.', ""Oldfield's Test career extended from 1920 until 1937, during which period he played in 54 Test matches for Australia, the same number that Herbert Sutcliffe played in for England. It is interesting to compare Oldfield's record of Test match appearances with some of his contemporaries; Bradman (52) played in fewer Test matches than Oldfield, JB Hobbs (61) played in seven more. Other wicketkeepers, Strudwick (28) and George Duckworth (24), mustered 52 appearances between them; Leslie Ames played 47 times for England. Nowadays, with seven countries of Test match status, it is by no means uncommon for a cricketer to clock up ten or more Test matches in twelve months; whereas between the two wars, there was often a two year gap between tours."", ""Oldfield played in the first three Test matches of MCC's ill-starred 1920-21 tour, and came over as second wicketkeeper to Hanson Carter with Warwick Armstrong's legendary Australians of 1921. In his account of this tour, ("", ' 1922) Sydney Pardon wrote: ""Neither of the wicketkeepers was a Blackham, but Carter more than upheld his old reputation, and Oldfield - the youngest player in the team - got on wonderfully well. It was a quite fitting compliment to give him his place against England at The Oval.""', 'Oldfield acquitted himself well in this Test match: in the England first innings of 403 for eight, the only extras recorded were three leg byes; the bowling of Gregory, McDonald, Mailey and Armstrong presented him with no problems.', ""It was in Gilligan's exciting tour of 1924-25 that Oldfield became established as one of the great wicketkeepers. Australia won the first two Test matches. In the third Test, set 375 to win, England had scored 348 for eight at the end of the sixth day's play, Gilligan and AP Freeman being the not out batsmen. On the next morning 9 runs were added before Gilligan was out for 31. Freeman and Strudwick took the score to within 12 runs of victory, when Oldfield caught Freeman off Mailey - and the Ashes remained with Australia."", ""In the fourth Test match Oldfield provided unforgettable evidence of the astonishing speed of his reflex actions, when he stumped Hobbs, Woolley, Chapman and Whysall in England's first and only innings. Hobbs was stumped off Jack Ryder, Woolley and Chapman off Mailey, and Whysall off Kelleway. Oldfield's "", ' was evidently the dismissal of Hobbs, when Ryder sent down an unexpectedly fast delivery that rose cap high: Hobbs, in avoiding the ball, moved momentarily out of his crease; Oldfield, meanwhile, in an amazing movement, had taken the ball and flicked a bail off.', 'In the fifth Test match Oldfield caught Hobbs in the first innings and stumped him in the second. In the first innings he caught him wide on the leg side off Gregory; this catch, says ', "" (1926), greatly influenced the course of the match - Australia in fact, went on to win by 307 runs. In the second innings Oldfield stumped Hobbs for 13, the bowler being a newcomer to Test cricket named Clarrie Grimmett, who signalled his arrival by taking five for 45 in the first innings and six for 37 in the second. Four of Grimmett's victims were stumped by Oldfield."", 'England regained the Ashes after fifteen years, in 1926, when Australia was defeated in the final Test at The Oval. HL Collins, the Australian captain, said that he couldn\'t remember Oldfield making a solitary mistake during the entire tour. ""Neat, quiet and skilful"" said ', ' (1927), ""Oldfield showed himself as well-equipped a wicketkeeper as any side could desire to possess and completely overshadowed his deputy Ellis.""', ""England's first five innings in the 1928-29 series totalled 1912 runs, Oldfield conceding three byes. In 1930 the Australians came to England, bringing with them the incredible Bradman. Oldfield's unobtrusive excellence behind the stumps was one of the factors that helped them to regain the Ashes."", 'Then came MCC\'s 1932-33 tour of Australia, the unfortunate ""bodyline"" series. Excitement reached its peak in a crescendo of anger in the third Test, pungently described at the time as ""the battle of Adelaide"", when Oldfield, trying to duck a cannonball delivery from Larwood, was hit on the head, and carried unconscious off the field. His comment on regaining consciousness was typical of Oldfield: ""My own fault."" Later, when Larwood settled in Australia, the two became the closest of friends.', ""Australia toured England in 1934; Oldfield's wicketkeeping was as good as ever, and, as usual, he rendered good service in the lower half of the batting order. His last game against England was in the fifth Test at Melbourne, in 1937, when Australia, having lost the first two Tests, came up from behind to win the match, and the Ashes. His farewell performance in a Test match was highly successful; he sent back Barnett, Allen and Voce in England's first innings and did not give away a bye in either innings. "", ""Altogether Bert Oldfield played in 38 Tests against England. Ten of his eleven matches against South Africa and all five against the West Indies were played towards the close of his career, so it is chiefly in the matches against England that he will be remembered. There can be no doubt that he was at his peak in the 1924-25 series against Gilligan's men; and in the 1926 tour of England."", 'Altogether in his 54 Test matches, his bag was 130 dismissals; he made 78 catches and stumped 52. The 52 stumpings are a record for Test match cricket.', 'Oldfield was small and wiry, with a quiet sense of humour and a genius for making friends. He had wonderfully quick reflexes, and, as an acquaintance said, ""a mind like a compass needle."" He was neat, efficient and unobtrusive in his movements. ""You never knew he was there until he had you out"" said CG Macartney. Not for Bert Oldfield the raucous appeal.', 'Once, in a Test match, Strudwick appealed for a catch at the wicket against Oldfield. The umpire said not out.

While the move was not\nwithout some short-term benefits - his sound wicketkeeping skills and a\ncourageous second Test century on tour in the Caribbean in 1984 encouraged\nhopes of a long and fruitful stint in the role - it effectively spelled the\nbeginning of the end for his international ambitions.

Paine originally broke his right index finger in November 2010, when he was struck on the hand by a Dirk Nannes delivery while batting in an Australian Cricketers' Association All-Stars T20 match, and it caused him considerable problems over the next few years. It was extremely unfortunate timing for Paine, who had played four Tests earlier in 2010 against Pakistan and India while Haddin recovered from an elbow injury. On the India tour especially, Paine had shown impressive ability with the bat, scoring 92 and 59, but his own injury problems led to Matthew Wade jumping him in the queue to become the new second-in-line to Haddin. Although Paine subsequently appeared in a few ODIs and T20s, he spent nearly six years out of the national set-up before being recalled in February 2017 for a T20 series against Sri Lanka. \n"", ""It had looked as though Paine would perhaps never play for Australia again, for at times, as his career progressed, he was not even the first-choice gloveman for Tasmania. In first-class cricket he suffered from a lack of hundreds - in fact, the 215 that he scored while playing as a specialist batsman in his fifth Sheffield Shield game, back in October 2006, remained his only first-class century. It was quite remarkable for a player with such talent, although Paine was often a fine domestic contributor and played in Tasmania's triumphant Sheffield Shield finals in 2006-07 and 2012-13. He had also played in two successful domestic one-day finals for the Tigers, and was Man of the Match in the 2009-10 final when he opened the batting and scored 100. A respected leader who often captained Tasmania, Paine also led the Hobart Hurricanes, and it was ultimately through T20 that his return to international cricket finally arrived."", 'The composure Paine showed in the shortest form, combined with the underwhelming contributions of Peter Nevill and Matthew Wade, led selectors to think laterally ahead of the 2017-18 Ashes, in which his selection was the most surprising and indeed contentious. But he performed admirably as part of a winning team, and then found himself thrust into the centre of things on the subsequent South Africa tour. He was initially the man who separated David Warner from Quinton de Kock in the Durban stairwell, then the man who replaced Steven Smith as captain the morning after the Newlands ball-tampering fiasco.

Much though he accomplished, his career was a trifle disappointing. Competing with a number of great players, he was merely a good one, whose place was never quite secure and who fell below the incredibly high standards of his contemporaries in fielding. In his first season for Victoria, 1912-13, he took thirty wickets at 15.40 and it seemed that a new star had arisen. He also had a batting average of 33. Bowling fastish right-hand, he ran the ball away and could also make it lift. In the next season his wickets cost more, but he did one outstanding all-round performance, taking seven for 88 in the first innings against South Australia and scoring 36 not out and 105. In 1914-15 his batting average rose to 85, but his eight wickets cost him 28.62 runs each. \n', ""When cricket was resumed after the war, it was clear that his bowling promise was not going to be fulfilled. Thenceforward, he was only a change, used on his tours in England to relieve the leading bowlers in the lesser matches: in Tests against England his thirteen wickets cost 48.66 apiece. Nevertheless he played in all five Tests against Douglas's side in 1920-21, though his highest score was only 52 not out and his average 18.85. Doubtless his innings of 54 and 105 in the second match for Victoria against the Englishmen kept him his place in the last two Tests. But it must have been a disappointment when in England that summer he did not get a place in a single Test."", ""Against Arthur Gilligan's side in 1924-25 a bad back put him out of consideration for the first two Tests, but in the third, coming in at 119 for six, he made 201 in six and a half hours, a remarkable effort of concentration for one who was primarily an attacker, and followed it with 88 in the  second innings. In fairness it must be said that the English bowling was gravely depleted: Tate, Gilligan and later Freeman were off the field and Woolley was handicapped by a weak knee. Freeman, as tough a little man as ever stepped on to a cricket field, fainted with pain when one of Ryder's on-drives which he was attempting to catch hit him on the wrist."", ""In England in 1926 Ryder was again a disappointment: he had a respectable record for the whole tour, but did little in the Tests. Nevertheless in 1928-29 he was made captain against Chapman's side. Few men can have had a more difficult assignment. Collins,  Bardsley, Macartney, Taylor and Mailey had retired, Arthur Richardson was in England and Gregory and Kelleway broke down in the first Test and played no more. Under the circumstances the surprise was not that Australia should lose the series 4-1 to a strong side, but that they should recover so quickly as to regain the Ashes in England in  1930. For their failure in Australia no blame could attach to Ryder. He simply had not the material nor was he well served by the selectors: he himself made 492 runs with an average of 54.66, including a century in the third Test. After this considerable surprise and some resentment was caused when he was omitted from the 1930 team for England. No doubt his co-selectors (he was himself now a selector) felt that, if he went, he must be captain and that for that Woodfull was the better choice."", ' Ryder continued to play for Victoria until 1931-32, captained an unofficial Australian side on a tour of India in 1935-36 and was a selector again from 1946 to 1970. He also did much to help young players. Standing over six foot, he was almost entirely a front-of-the-wicket player with an immensely powerful drive. He was certainly more effective in  Australia than in England. His highest score was 295 against New South Wales in 1926 when Victoria compiled the record total of 1107.\n']",[],20.0,32,5,1394.0,201*,51.62,,,3,9,,3,17.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,177.0,274,37,10501,295,44.30,,,24,55,,,133.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20.0,28,1897,743,17.0,2/20,2/29,43.7,2.35,111.5,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,177.0,,15444,7064,238,7/53,,29.68,2.74,64.8,,9,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Striding out with his team in turmoil against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup, a game and tournament he never expected to play in, Symonds sculpted a masterly 143 not out in 125 balls. Until that day, he had mustered just 762 one-day runs at only 23; after that he averaged more than 43 and became a hero to those who adored his clumping style. ""In the past,"" he admitted, ""I was a man without a map when I went out to bat."" He grew to understand his one-day role perfectly - he could have claimed to be the side\'s most valuable player after pounding three hundreds and taking 21 wickets in 2005-06. His impact to the limited-overs outfit was shown the following season after he ripped a tendon from his arm playing a fierce drive. Without him the team struggled to its worst losing streak in a decade. Symonds proved he was an incredibly quick healer by entering the World Cup mid-tournament and was part of his second consecutive triumph. ', ""Born in Birmingham, Symonds could have played for England but dreamed only of wearing the baggy green. In 2004 his fantasy was fulfilled in decidedly unGabbalike surroundings: the crackling minefields of Sri Lanka. He batted gamely without looking altogether comfortable, and was dumped after two Tests. Almost two years later he received an extended run as Australia's selectors searched for an answer to Andrew Flintoff, but he couldn't consistently mirror his one-day performances. Faced with the axe, he cracked a huge six at the MCG to open his scoring in a pressure-relieving 72 from 54 balls, which included a ground-record five maximums, but was dropped on the Bangladesh tour after struggling for reliable impact in the previous series against South Africa. Given another opportunity when Shane Watson was injured and Damien Martyn retired, he appeared in his first Ashes series and reached a career high in his second game with 156 at the MCG. Batting with his fishing friend Matthew Hayden, he showed he had the mindset to make it. "", 'The 2007-08 campaign was easily his best, with 777 runs in nine Tests against Sri Lanka, India and West Indies. The high was an unbeaten 162 in the first innings at the SCG, which was quickly followed by the low of a lengthy race row involving Harbhajan Singh. The problems did not prevent him becoming the most popular overseas player at the Indian Premier League auction, where he sold for US$1.35m, and he had four games with the Deccan Chargers. After the tournament he switched back into five-day mode and a pair of half-centuries in the tight opening contest with West Indies showed his growing batting maturity and sense of security at Test level. By the end of the campaign his average was a respectable 44.65. ', 'However, his off-field attitude continued to be a problem and the last straw came when he went fishing in Darwin when he should have been at a team meeting in the lead-up to an ODI series against Bangladesh. Symonds was sent home from the series and not picked for the tour of India in late 2008. He was rushed back in Australia and was involved in a pub scuffle while celebrating the first Test win, and he appeared in three more matches before undergoing knee surgery. A radio interview where he targeted Brendon McCullum was a factor in him being banned for the South Africa tour - along with his poor form for Queensland - and he was unconvincing in his one-day return in the United Arab Emirates. A breaking of team drinking rules led to his exit from the squad in England on the eve of the 2009 World Twenty20, and his Cricket Australia contract was soon cancelled. He retired from white clothes to become a Twenty20 specialist, playing for Queensland, Deccan Chargers and Surrey, and ultimately retired from all cricket in February 2012.']",['One-Day International Player of the Year - 2005'],26.0,41,5,1462.0,162*,40.61,2256,64.80,2,10,154,28,22.0,0.0,198.0,161,33,5088.0,156,39.75,5504,92.44,6,30,449,103,82.0,0.0,14.0,11,4,337.0,85*,48.14,199,169.34,0,2,33,10,3.0,0.0,227.0,376,33,14477,254*,42.20,,,40,65,,,159.0,0.0,424.0,377,51,11099,156,34.04,,,9,64,,,187.0,0.0,93.0,85,19,2141,117*,32.43,1453,147.35,2,12,194,83,42.0,0.0,26.0,41,2094,896,24.0,3/50,5/56,37.33,2.56,87.2,0,0,0,198.0,158,5935,4955,133.0,5/18,5/18,37.25,5.00,44.6,2,1,0,14.0,12,185,277,8.0,2/14,2/14,34.62,8.98,23.1,0,0,0,227.0,,17633,8714,242,6/105,,36.00,2.96,72.8,,2,0,424.0,,11714,9379,282,6/14,6/14,33.25,4.80,41.5,2,4,0,93.0,75,1237,1657,52,5/18,5/18,31.86,8.03,23.7,0,1,0,False,True,False,True

Yet, by early 2014, he had not only added another dozen caps to the single Baggy Green awarded six years earlier but also played a full part in two Ashes series, including the 2013-14 whitewashing of England. Not bad for a 36-year-old and confirmation that, in cricket at least, ""never say never"" is a phrase worth remembering. \n', 'A prolific run-scorer at state and county level for 15 years, left-handed opener Rogers was the right man in the right place at the right time when Australia decided they needed a dollop of experience, rather than more youthful promise, for the 2013 Ashes series in England following the retirements of Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey. Given his familiarity with English conditions - having played for four first-class counties - and his consistency at the top of Middlesex\'s order in recent times, picking ""Buck"" Rogers made perfect sense. ', ""Despite losing the series, Australia laid good foundations for what was to follow just a few months later. Their 'new' opener added some much-needed resolve to the batting line-up - and at Chester-le-Street became the second-oldest man to score a maiden Test century for Australia, behind the 37-year-old Arthur Richardson in 1926. It was a fighting innings in difficult, seaming conditions and suggested that Rogers could play an important role for Australia for some time to come. By the time he made his 110 against England, Rogers had already scored 60 hundreds and 20,000 runs in first-class cricket but, until 2013, had always found himself behind others - like Phil Jaques, Simon Katich, Phillip Hughes and Shane Watson - in the Test opening queue."", '\nNo longer. If 2013 enabled Rogers to get his feet under the Test table, the Australian summer that followed saw him feasting hungrily on the treats now available to him. Not only did he score centuries in the final two Ashes Tests, in Melbourne and Sydney - he said the SCG innings was ""as well as I have ever played"" - but he also finished as the leading scorer from either team across the back-to-back Ashes series.', 'It was all a far cry from 2008 when Rogers, taking the place of an injured Matthew Hayden at the WACA, scored just 4 and 15 against India. At the end of that season, he left Western Australia (having been frustrated by a lack of one-day opportunities) for Victoria, where he continued his prolific domestic run-scoring.', ""Thoughtful, intelligent and setting high standards of himself, Rogers' professionalism increased through his extensive experience in England; a county regular since 2004, he has played for Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Middlesex and Someset, retiring from first-class cricket in 2016 after coming achingly close to leading Somerset to their first Championship title. County cricket also gave Rogers the chance to achieve the rare feat of scoring a double-century against his own country. Playing for Leicestershire in 2005, he opened the batting against the Australians and posted 56 and 219 despite chat from Hayden, who said he should get out to benefit the national team. In 2006-07, Rogers was handed a Cricket Australia contract after leading the domestic first-class run list with 1201 at 70.70 for Western Australia. "", ""Although many a bowler might find it hard to believe, Rogers is short-sighted and colour blind, which means he sometimes struggles to focus on the red ball when it mixes with the background. But he possesses a fine cricketing pedigree: his father, John, represented New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield in the late 1960s and later became a respected administrator, ultimately assuming a post as general manager of the Western Australian Cricket Association. The son's future looked promising from the moment he was selected for the Australian Under-19 side in 1996.

A favourite wicket was that of Ken Funston at the Gabba in December 1952.

Although\nhe possessed a relatively unremarkable run-up and action (the most notable\nfeature of which was a high leap just before he released the ball) and was\nnever regarded as a tearaway fast bowler, Spofforth was an inspiration both\nfor his peers and succeeding generations of pacemen.

He was also the first\nbowler to clinch a Test hat-trick; he claimed ten wickets in a match on four\nof those 18 occasions, and his analysis of 14/90 against England at The Oval\nin 1882 still stands as the second best performance in a match by an\nAustralian bowler in the entire history of Test cricket.

He\nleft another enduring legacy for other fast bowlers to follow in that he was\none of the first Test cricketers to exhibit the trait of refusing to take a\nbackward step in his approach to the game either on or off the field.

Smith's talent was apparent early, but as a young batsman he had more moving parts than an orchestra, only they didn't always work in harmony. He went away and worked on his game and returned to the Test side two years later with a much tighter technique. He still fidgeted between balls but could play every shot in the book, and a few more that defied words besides. Smith is quick-footed and adept at facing spin, but is equally comfortable driving and pulling the fast bowlers. His first Test century came at The Oval in the 2013 Ashes and his composure was apparent in the way he brought up the milestone with a six safely lofted down the ground. Over the next year he continued to improve and 2014-15 became the Summer of Steve, as he scored centuries in all four first innings of the home Tests against India. \n"", ""\nIt was also in the 2014-15 home summer that he became Australia's 45th Test captain, filling in for the injured Michael Clarke in three Tests.

It became clear that Smith was to be Clarke's successor, a move that was confirmed after Clarke's retirement at the end of the 2015 Ashes in England. It was also clear that Smith had become the most important batsman in Australia's team; his 215 in the win at Lord's came after a promotion up the order to No.3. As Smith's batting developed his bowling became less frequently sighted, although he could still land the odd fizzing legbreak and winkle out a wicket or two.

He subsequently became a first-rate opening batsman, although it wasn't until his 30th Test, by which time he had succeeded to the captaincy, that he first posted a Test hundred. He made this breakthrough innings at Old Trafford count, by turning it into 311 in almost 13 hours. In all he made 1381 Test runs in 1964, a record at the time. Hard-bitten and immensely dedicated, he steadily rationalised his repertoire of strokes, eschewing the hook, but excelling as an acquirer of singles; Australia has had no more productive an opening pairing than Simpson and Bill Lawry. With the advent of World Series Cricket in April 1977, Simmo emerged from retirement at 41 to lead Australia again, against India, where his old powers against spin were evident, and West Indies, whose fast bowlers proved more taxing: his captaincy record, ultimately, was rather modest. When Australia went looking for a fulltime coach in the mid-1980s, he was again the Board's choice, and gave Allan Border's team a taste of the discipline to which he had always submitted himself as a player. A martinet where fitness, fielding and batting technique were concerned, he held the job for a controversial but successful decade, during which time the team won the World Cup and regained both the Ashes and the Frank Worrell Trophy.

A hard-working, hostile fast bowler who has not always been viewed as the epitome of subtlety, Siddle has been used as an enforcer, a workhorse and at times as the spearhead of Australia's bowling group. But he is also a man of contradictions, a tough rural Victorian who was a competitive woodchopper in his youth, yet since 2012 a vegan whose diet can consist of 15 to 20 bananas a day. Such a diet would hardly have appealed to Merv Hughes, a fellow Victorian who filled a similar role in Australia's team in the 1980s and 90s and, like Siddle since 2010, was largely considered a Test-match specialist. \n"", 'First picked for the tour of India in 2008-09, Siddle made his Test debut in Mohali and hit Gautam Gambhir in the head with his first ball, before claiming Sachin Tendulkar as his maiden Test wicket. Solid performances in the back-to-back series against South Africa confirmed his place in the side and he was a committed figure during the 2009 Ashes tour - loud and brash on the field and calm off it - and a first-innings 5 for 21 in Leeds helped him to 20 wickets. In October of that year, he was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year, but a quiet home Test summer was followed by a stress fracture in his back, which required lengthy rehabilitation.', ""His comeback could hardly have been more memorable. At the Gabba on the opening day of the 2010-11 Ashes series, Siddle celebrated his 26th birthday by becoming the ninth Australian to take a Test hat-trick, his yorker at Stuart Broad's toes leading to a typically animated, and successful, lbw appeal. The series was a fiasco for Australia, but Siddle at least managed to collect 6 for 75 on his home ground at the MCG, even if Australia were crushed in the match. The following summer he bowled with more pace, swing and accuracy and collected 23 wickets at 18.65 in the 4-0 thrashing of India, and was Man of the Match in the final Test in Adelaide after taking 5 for 49 in the first innings on a good batting pitch."", 'Adelaide again proved eventful for Siddle the next season. After flying home from the 2012 tour of the West Indies with a back injury, Siddle returned to the side against South Africa and his energy levels under his new diet were tested to the maximum at Adelaide Oval. The loss of James Pattinson mid-match to an injury left Siddle with a huge workload; he sent down 63.5 overs in the Test, the most by an Australian fast bowler this century. By the closing stages of day five with Australia seeking two wickets to win, Siddle was down on his haunches between balls, exhausted and, he later admitted, ""a little bit delirious"". Siddle claimed four wickets in the innings but South Africa held on for a draw, and the workload led to Siddle missing the next Test. When he returned for the first Test against Sri Lanka, he responded with a career best match haul of 9 for 104.', ""Siddle struggled for impact on Australia's hopeless 2012-13 tour of India but was typically persistent and reliable in the back-to-back Ashes campaigns in 2013-14. He showed intelligence in his use of the crease to add variety and his ability to build pressure on England's batsmen with consistent lines and lengths made him an important, if under-rated, member of the attack. But a preference for out-and-out pace from the selectors led to Siddle losing his spot in the team during the tour of South Africa in early 2014, and he was asked to work on regaining the yard of speed he had lost. "", 'Siddle grew up in Morwell in rural Victoria and was already a promising competitive woodchopper when he eventually took up cricket at 14. He became a successful youth player whose honours included taking 11 for 47 in a state under-17 match, breaking the long-standing record of John Scholes, the late Victoria coach. Injuries hampered his early domestic career, with a shoulder reconstruction sidelining him for most of 2006-07 and further shoulder problems troubling him the following season.\n']",['ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2009'],64.0,90,14,1080.0,51,14.21,2295,47.05,0,2,116,4,17.0,0.0,20.0,6,3,31.0,10*,10.33,30,103.33,0,0,2,0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1,1,1.0,1*,-,1,100.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,158.0,212,37,2893,103*,16.53,5721,50.56,1,5,304,18,50.0,0.0,55.0,29,10,240,62,12.63,242,99.17,0,1,24,4,6.0,0.0,46.0,14,9,31,9*,6.20,37,83.78,0,0,2,1,9.0,0.0,64.0,120,13325,6482,214.0,6/54,9/104,30.28,2.91,62.2,8,8,0,20.0,19,901,743,17.0,3/55,3/55,43.7,4.94,53.0,0,0,0,2.0,2,48,58,3.0,2/24,2/24,19.33,7.25,16.0,0,0,0,158.0,291,30398,14845,535,8/54,9/77,27.74,2.93,56.8,22,20,0,55.0,54,2764,2140,59,4/27,4/27,36.27,4.64,46.8,1,0,0,46.0,45,936,1143,40,4/29,4/29,28.57,7.32,23.4,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

He came over with a big reputation as a left-handed slow bowler, and, favoured as he was by a wet season, met with considerable success. In all matches he obtained 127 wickets for just over 17 runs apiece, and in the four Test Matches in which he took part he dismissed eighteen men at a cost of rather more than 26 runs per wicket. On turf which suited him he was undoubtedly a difficult bowler. Delivering the ball from a good height and getting on an appreciable amount of spin, his big break made him at times quite deadly, but his action was open to criticism. In the Test Match at Sheffield, when Australia played better all-round cricket than England and won by 143 runs, Saunders obtained five wickets for 50 in the first innings, but had 68 runs hit off twelve overs in the second innings without dismissing anybody. At Manchester, where Australia won a remarkable match by 3 runs, Saunders, on a ruined pitch, had much to do with the victory. Eight runs were wanted when Tate, the last man, joined Rhodes, and, having scored a 4 from the first ball he received from Saunders, he was bowled by the fourth which came with the bowler's arm and kept low. The Oval match was the one in which G. L. Jessop played his great innings of 104 after half the England side were out for 48. Saunders took four wickets in the second innings, the first three falling to him for 10 runs, but Darling undoubtedly kept him on too long, and he came in for severe punishment when Jessop was hitting in such terrific fashion. During the tour Saunders' most noteworthy bowling performance was in the second match against Surrey at the Oval when he took six wickets for 9 runs. Among his best performances on Australian wickets were:--"", 'In Test matches against England he obtained 64 wickets for 25-32 runs each, and against South Africa, 15 for 11.73 apiece.

Records that stand to his name tell of his work with the ball, but it is remarkable that in the first set of photographs that appeared in ', "" he is holding a bat and wearing pads in company with his colleague J. J. Ferris, grasping a ball in his left hand. Chosen with G. A. Lohmann, of Surrey, Robert Peel, of Yorkshire, John Briggs, of Lancashire, and S. M. J. Woods, of Cambridge University and Somerset--himself an Australian--the two members of the team captained by P. S. McDonnell fully deserved the honour, for they practically dominated every match in which they played on this their first visit to England. In a season when bowlers accomplished wonderful things, almost beyond belief in these days, Turner took 314 wickets at 11.12 runs apiece and Ferris 224 at 14.10 each-- G. H. S. Trott coming next with 48 at 23.41. In nine matches against specially chosen sides, three representing England, 70 wickets fell to Turner and 41 to Ferris, seven others claiming only 23 between them. The habit prevailed at that time or relying upon two or three bowlers on a side for the chief work of the season and McDonnell carried this custom to the extreme limit, but of the other specialists picked by C. F. Pardon, Lohmann for Surrey was almost as supreme with 253 wickets at 10.69, Beaumont, with 59, giving most help in carrying off the championship in this year of bowlers' triumphs mainly on rain-affected pitches. \n"", ""To have seen these masters of the art at the Oval is a pleasant recollection, and not one of them creates a happier memory than Turner in his rather long rhythmic run and beautiful right-arm action without any effort to make the most of his medium height--five feet nine inches. He delivered the ball almost facing square down the pitch, and, added to his off-break with slightly varied pace about fast-medium, was ability to turn the ball from leg, send down a fast yorker, and, above all, to get quick lift from the turf. As sufficient evidence of Turner's skill, Sir Stanley Jackson said in last year's "", "", I always regarded Charles Turner as the best medium-paced bowler I ever played against--and he could gather an opinion as he scored 91 at Lord's and 103 at the Oval in the Tests in 1893, when Turner, on his third and last visit to England, fell from his greatest achievement to 149 wickets at 14 each, after 215 at 12 in 1890."", "" Turner earned fame in the 1886-87 season against Arthur Shrewsbury's team. After taking 13 wickets for 54 runs for New South Wales, he in his first Test match dismissed six batsmen for 15 runs, England being all out for 45, which remains the lowest total by England against Australia. He excelled again for New South Wales with 14 wickets for 59, clean bowling Shrewsbury for nought in each innings. In the following season, when Shrewsbury again captained a side in Australia, Turner for New South Wales took 10 wickets for 45 and 16 for 79. G. F. Vernon led another team in Australia at that time, and against the Combined England sides Turner claimed 12 wickets for 87, but, thanks to Peel and Lohmann, the visitors beat Australia by 126 runs. Altogether in 1887-88 Turner took 106 wickets at 13.59 apiece, and his record of being the only bowler to take a hundred wickets in first-class cricket in a season in Australia still stands."", ""So expectations were rife and at once we knew in England that no one had overrated The Terror. Turner and Ferris routed side after side, actually disposing of England at Lord's for 53 and 62 and steering Australia to victory by 61 runs. Ten wickets for 63 was Turner's share at the expense of very powerful batting, as shown in the other two Tests played on hard turf and both won by England with an innings to spare. Turner also gave early proof of his batting ability, for in the third victory of the tour, each gained in two days, he played a dashing innings of 103 at the Oval, and then, taking nine wickets for 101 runs, was chiefly instrumental in beating Surrey, the champion county of the year, by an innings and 154 runs. Checks were bound to occur when so many strong teams were opposed, but at Lord's Turner returned an average of eleven Middlesex wickets for 59 runs in a low-scoring match, and whenever helped by the state of the turf he did wonders. Twelve wickets for 64 runs at Old Trafford against North of England; 11 for 76 at Liverpool; 11 for 64 at Leicester, where the county won a sensational match by 20 runs--thanks to Pougher, 10 for 91, and Arnall-Thompson, nine for 65; then 13 for 46 at Derby and 13 for 48 at Stoke against an England XI in the course of five days. In the first innings of the Stoke match Turner bowled seven men and got two leg-before, the other being run out. So he paved the way for that big performance in the first meeting with England at Lord's. Ten wickets for 46 against Yorkshire and ten for 59 against Kent also may be cited, and still more extraordinary was his greatest return, 17 wickets for 50 runs against an England XI, at Hastings in August. In the two innings Turner hit the stumps 14 times, got two men l.b.w., and one stumped--further wonderful proof of how he did beat the bat.

Of all the great Australian batsmen Victor Trumper was by general consent the best and most brilliant. No one else among the famous group, from Charles Bannerman - thirty-nine years ago - to Bardsley and Macartney at the present time, had quite such remarkable powers. To say this involves no depreciation of Clem Hill, Noble, or the late WL Murdoch. Trumper at the zenith of his fame challenged comparison with Ranjitsinhji. He was great under all conditions of weather and ground. He could play quite an orthodox game when he wished to, but it was his ability to make big scores when orthodox methods were unavailing that lifted him above his fellows. \n', 'For this reason Trumper was, in proportion, more to be feared on treacherous wickets than on fast, true ones. No matter how bad the pitch might be from the combined effects of rain and sunshine, he was quite likely to get 50 runs, his skill in pulling good-length balls amounting to genius. Of this fact our English bowlers had convincing evidence day after day during the season of 1902. Trumper paid four visits to this country - in 1899, 1902, 1905, and 1909 - but it was in 1902 that he reached his highest point.', ""In that summer of wretched weather he scored 2570 runs in thirty-five matches for the Australian team, with the wonderful average, in the circumstances, of 48. He was as consistent as he was brilliant, and did not owe his average to a few exceptional scores. Of eleven innings of over a hundred, the biggest was 128. Trumper did not again touch the same level in this country. He played very well in 1905 and 1909, but he was no longer pre-eminent. He was fifth in the averages in 1905, and in 1909 he was overshadowed by Bardsley and Ransford. In the latter year, however, he was seen at his best, notably against England at The Oval, when he played DW Carr's googlies with perfect ease, and in the second match against MCC at Lord's. When he came here first, in 1899, he jumped at once into the front rank, playing a splendid innings of 135 not out against England at Lord's and scoring 300 not out against Sussex at Brighton. His innings at Lord's was in itself sufficient to prove that Australia had found a world's batsman. Nothing could have been better."", 'His career culminated when the South Africans visited Australia in the season of 1910-11. He then recovered his finest form, and on the beautiful wickets at Melbourne, Adelaide, and Sydney the googly bowlers had no terrors for him. In the five Test matches he scored 662 runs, with an average of 94. It was agreed on all hands that he had not played so well since his trip to England in 1902. Under all conditions Trumper was a fascinating batsman to watch. His extreme suppleness lent a peculiar grace to everything he did. When he was hitting up a big score batting seemed quite an easy matter. He took so many liberties, however, and scored from so many good balls, that in order to do himself justice he had to be in the best possible health and condition. The strokes with which he drove even the best bowlers to despair demanded a marvellous union of hand and eye. His game at its highest point of excellence could only be played by a young man.', ""Trumper was the most popular Australian cricketer of his time. A match played for his benefit - between New South Wales and the Rest of Australia   at Sydney in February, 1913 - produced in gate-money and donations nearly £3000. Born on November 2, 1877,  Trumper was in his thirty-eighth year. He had been in bad health for some little time, and the latest accounts of his condition received in this country were so discouraging as to prepare his friends for the worst. He died of Bright's disease. Trumper was never spoilt by success in the cricket field. When his name was in everyone's mouth he remained as modest and unaffected as on the day he first set foot in  England.\n""]","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1903', 'Australian Cricket Hall of Fame 1996']",48.0,89,8,3163.0,214*,39.04,,,8,13,,,31.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,255.0,401,21,16939,300*,44.57,,,42,87,,,173.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48.0,15,546,317,8.0,3/60,3/87,39.62,3.48,68.2,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,255.0,,3822,2008,64,5/19,,31.37,3.15,59.7,,2,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

On the wet pitches often found in those days, especially the sticky wickets in his native Australia he was virtually unplayable.

He turned the ball enough to beat\nthe bat on true pitches, but on a wet wicket could make the ball bite, turn and lift spitefully. He fooled many a good batsman with a well disguised slower ball, often resulting in a caught and bowled. He was also a very useful batsman with 4 Test fifties and three first-class centuries to his name, mostly concentrating on defence. At the start of the 1899 tour he was batting at No. 10, but by the end he was opening in Tests -  he achieved the double of 100 wickets and 1000 runs that summer. One of his greatest performances came, unfortunately, in a losing cause, making 64 and 7 and  taking 4 for 108 and 8 for 65 in the Oval Test in 1902, England winning that game by a solitary wicket.

Came to England in 1888, 1890, 1893, and 1896. Australia has produced greater cricketers than Harry Trott, but in his day he held a place in the front rank of the world\'s famous players. He was a first-rate bat, a fine field at point, and his leg breaks made him a very effective change bowler. Four times he came to England--first in 1888, again in 1890 and 1893, and, finally, in 1896, when he had the honour of captaining the team. As a leader in the field he perhaps gained even more distinction than as an all-round player. Ranjitsinhji considered him a better captain than Darling, and beyond that praise could hardly go. The personal popularity that Harry Trott enjoyed in 1896 wherever he went was remarkable. One is inclined to think that no Australian captain before or since, was liked so much by his opponents. By sheer force of character he overcame the disadvantages involved in lack of education, and won the warm regard of men with whom, apart from the comradeship of the cricket field, he had nothing in common. In managing his team he owed much to his equable temper and innate tact. Knowing all the little weaknesses and vanities of the men under his command, he believed in a policy of kindly encouragement. Never outwardly disturbed by the state of the game, he could inspire even the most despondent with something of his own cheerfulness. He played cricket in the best possible spirit, taking victory and defeat with the same calm philosophy. \n', ""No better loser was ever seen that Harry Trott at the end of the Test match at the Oval in 1896. It was the disappointment of his life, as the result decided the rubber in England's favour, but he was full of praise for the way in which Peel and J. T. Hearne had made the most of a horribly difficult wicket. In the England match at Lord's the same season Trott played his finest innings, he and Sydney Gregory enabling Australia to make a most creditable fight in face of overwhelming odds. Against Tom Richardson's bowling on a wicket of lightning pace Trott trusted to the strength of his back play and was justified by success. His method recalled the way in which Daft and Bob Carpenter used to withstand the fastest bowling at Lord's on the much rougher wickets of the early'60's. Trott made 143 and Gregory 103, the two batsmen putting on 221 runs for the fourth wicket in Australia's second innings. Trott's play was almost flawless, but the Englishmen felt certain that Hayward caught him in the slips with his score at 61. Perhaps next to this 143 the best innings Trott ever played in this country was his 92 against England at the Oval in 1893. Trott, who had been in ill-health for some time before his death, was the elder brother of the late Albert Trott, who for many years played so brilliantly for Middlesex.--S.H.P.\n"", ' NOTE.--Only matches on even terms included in the cases of the English and American tours; in New Zealand only the matches with the provinces.

Tall, with striking, rugged features, he was known to his team-mates as The Black Prince (Sid Barnes enviously dubbed him The Film Star), having earlier, in his boxing days, been called `Johnson' for his swarthiness (the American black heavyweight Jack Johnson ruled the boxing world just before Toshack was born). \n"", 'Son of a stationmaster, Ernest Raymond Herbert Toshack was born in the New South Wales bush town of Cobar on December 8, 1914, and was orphaned when a boy. He was cared for by relatives in Lyndhurst, and played his early cricket and rugby league for Cowra. It was not until he was 30 that he ventured to Sydney, having already played for the State Colts and 2nd XI. A fastish left-arm bowler at that time, he first approached Petersham, the club for which he qualified residentially, ""but they didn\'t want to know me"". So he joined Marrickville, quickly rising to first-grade.', 'Wheelchair-bound for months after a ruptured appendix in 1938, he was rejected for war service, so worked instead at the Lithgow Small Arms factory, in the Blue Mountains near Sydney. He was chosen for NSW as soon as the war ended and was quickly among the wickets. In March 1946, after seven matches for the state, he found himself opening the bowling for Australia with Ray Lindwall in a match at Wellington which was not recognised as a Test until a couple of years afterwards. New Zealand were routed in two days on a damp pitch, and Toshack came away with 4 for 12 and 2 for 6.', ""Against England in 1946-47, slowing down to exploit another tacky surface, and closely supervised by skipper Don Bradman, he had match figures of 9 for 99 at the Gabba in the first Test, but in the remaining four he only once took more than one wicket in an innings, his stamina in the Adelaide Test (5 for 135 off 66 eight-ball overs in great heat) impressed everyone. With his accuracy (mainly from over the wicket), pace-change, and movement either way, to a strong leg-side field, he was hard to get away, and achieved his successes in a style not unlike Derek Underwood's a generation later."", ""A damaged knee was a constant hindrance, but he was passed fit for the 1948 tour of Britain, which was to guarantee him a kind of immortality as a member of Bradman's Invincibles. Tiring of signing autograph sheets during the voyage, he entrusted a friend with the task. A consequence is that there are still sheets in circulation with his name mis-spelt as Toshak."", ""Toshack enjoyed the tour, where he became a great drinking friend of John Arlott. He was one of seven of the Australians who took 50 or more wickets, and he fluked a heady Test average of 51 (his aggregate in four innings), below only Morris, Barnes, Bradman and Harvey. The 20 not out he managed in the Lord's Test - his highest first-class score, made in a riotous tenth-wicket stand with Bill Johnston - gave him almost as much pleasure as his 5 for 40, which finished England off. Between the new-ball blitzes of Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and Johnston every 55 overs, Toshack was the key element in tying England down. Nowhere was this ability better shown than in the Sussex match, when his 17 overs yielded only three scoring strokes. Against a decent line-up he bowled 32 overs in the match while conceding 29 runs."", ""At Bramall Lane, Sheffield, he recorded the best figures of his 48-match career - 7 for 81 off 40 successive strangling overs - bemusing the Yorkshire crowd with his distinctive `Ow Wizz Ee?!' appeal. When Toshack took 6 for 51 off 27 overs against MCC at Lord's, it was considered by Bradman to be his best performance of all. If only his fascinating duel with Denis Compton had been caught on film."", 'Toshack\'s harmless sense of fun was often on show. He would don a bowler hat, grab a furled umbrella, and shove a large cigar in his mouth, pretending to be a Pom. And when a Surrey member spotted him idly playing with a bread roll over lunch and asked him what would happen if he bowled it to Bradman, Toshack\'s instant reply was: ""He\'d hit it clean over the bakery, I expect.""', 'His knee went in the fourth Test, the celebrated match when Australia hit 404 for 3 to win, and he played little after that. He underwent a cartilage operation in London, and by the start of the 1949-50 season, when he took nine wickets in the Shield match at Brisbane, a back injury made it all too painful, and a meteoric career was suddenly spent.', ""In later years, he was glad to welcome visitors to his home in Sydney's northern suburbs with a beer and a chuckle and a glance through his scrapbook, though he lost touch with his old team-mates until the 1998 round of Invincibles reunions. Toshack leaves a wife, Kathleen, a daughter, and several grandchildren, and with his passing, only eight of the original 17 Invincibles remain.\n""]",[],12.0,11,6,73.0,20*,14.6,,,0,0,,0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,48.0,45,13,185,20*,5.78,,,0,0,,,10.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12.0,23,3140,989,47.0,6/29,11/31,21.04,1.88,66.8,2,4,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,48.0,,11901,3973,195,7/81,,20.37,2.00,61.0,,12,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

With an unusual slinging action, and an aggressive approach, he was a fearsome sight to batsmen. He debuted against Pakistan in 1972-73, but hampered by a broken bone in his foot (which he hid from the selectors) was ineffective. Recalled in 1974-5, and forming a partnership with Dennis Lillee, he terrorised the England tourists with consistent spells of extreme fast bowling, taking 33 wickets in\nthe series. His action put considerable stress on his body, particularly his right shoulder, and he was rarely fit enough to reach those peaks again. He adapted his methods, relying less on pure pace, and more on an excellent cutter, and seam and swing. He was always capable of unleashing a very fast bouncer that\nwould skid and follow the batsman from only just short of a length. He remained with the Australian side when many left to join the Packer circus in 1977, and carried their attack through two series against England and India, but left to join WSC shortly afterwards.

Too hot for England in 1974-75 and West Indies the following season, a shoulder injury sustained in an on-field collision at Adelaide in November 1976 restricted him thereafter.

Alert, agile and sure-handed, his stumpings were subtle, almost surgical, seldom involving the removal of more than one bail. As a batsman, too, his instincts were attacking: his highest Test score, 92 against England in January 1947, took only 87 minutes; his best first-class score of 146 not out included a last-wicket partnership of 100 in an hour, to which Geff Noblet contributed 9. Tallon's career was shortened by age and ill-health, but few cricketers create such a retrospective consensus."", ' \n', ""\nTALLON, DONALD, who died in Brisbane on September 7, 1984, aged 68, was a great wicket-keeper. Unlucky not to be chosen to tour England in 1938 - his omission caused quite a stir - he had to wait until after the war, in which he did Army service, to become established in the Australian side. Unusually tall for a wicket-keeper (5ft 10½ in) and very slim, he yet crouched low behind the stumps. He was a man of few words (partly, perhaps, because his hearing was not good) and of quick, neat movement of the gloves. Born in Bundaberg on the Queensland coast, he made his first appearance against an English side for a Queensland Country XI at Toowoomba in 1932-33, when he was sixteen. He stumped Sutcliffe. He first played for Queensland a year later and was still only nineteen when he scored 193 for Queensland against Victoria at Brisbane in 1932-36, the highest of his nine first-class hundreds. He was Queensland's leading batsman that year, with 503 runs at an average of 55.88. By the outbreak of war he had equalled E. Pooley's long-standing world record of twelve victims in a match (it has yet to be beaten) for Queensland against New South Wales at Sydney, this in the 1938-39 season. He had six in each innings, catching nine of them and stumping three. Seven dismissals in an innings for Queensland against Victoria at Brisbane a month later was also, at that time, a world record, though shared with several others."", ""The first of Don Tallon's 21 Tests was Australia's first after the war, against New Zealand at Wellington in March, 1946 (it was not granted Test status until 1948); his first victim came from a stumping off O'Reilly. Having made the wicket-keeping place his own against England in 1946-47, and established what was then a record twenty victims in the series, he was an integral part of Bradman's brilliant 1948 side in England, being equally at home whether keeping to the speed of Lindwall and Miller or the spin of Johnson, McCool and Ring. He had wonderful timing behind the stumps and exceptionally fast hands when it came to taking off the bails. Perhaps his most famous catch was at The Oval in 1948, when he dived down the leg side to dismiss Hutton for 30. He caught an authentic leg-glance left-handed and at full stretch - a great finish to Australia's splendid performance, wrote "", "", Hutton being the last man out and England's total a mere 52. Tallon came to England again in 1953, but he was 37 by then and no longer quite the supreme craftsman he had been. Having played in the first Test, he gave way to Langley."", ""His rugged weathered features helped to make him seem a typical Australian to many English cricket followers. In the few years after the war he was looked upon almost with awe. Bradman was of the opinion that as a wicket-keeper he was the equal of the great Oldfield, to whose coaching Tallon acknowledged a considerable debt. Lindwall and Miller both rate Tallon as the best they ever saw. His unavailability to tour South Africa in 1949-50 deprived him of one full series, but his Test victims numbered 58 (50ct, 8st). All told he claimed 432 first-class victims, no fewer than 129 of them being stumped, Australian cricket at that time being well endowed with leg-break bowlers. Tallon's batting record in Tests was disappointing, partly no doubt because in such a strong and all-conquering Australian side runs were seldom needed from him. His best Test score was his 92 against England at Melbourne in 1946-47, when he and Lindwall added 154 for the eighth wicket. In first-class cricket he scored 6,034 runs (average 29.18), in Test cricket 394 runs (average 17.13).\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1949'],21.0,26,3,394.0,92,17.13,,,0,2,,0,50.0,8.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,150.0,228,21,6034,193,29.14,,,9,27,,,302.0,131.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,150.0,,315,202,0,-,-,-,3.84,-,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He was named captain of Western Australia in 2012 having often filled the role previously in a stand-in capacity and was a semi-regular county cricketer during the off-season. Voges has played for Nottinghamshire, Middlesex and Hampshire.

Bill Whitty was a medium-fast left-hander whose sharp swerve made him something of an Australian version of George Hirst. Although he played 14 Test-taking 65 wickets at 21 apiece-in a first-class career from 1907 to 1926, Whitty never became a familiar name in cricket. Perhaps overshadowed by more glamorous players, he had an extraordinary record of success against the brightest star of his day, Victor Trumper. He bowled against Trumper in five SA v NSW Sheffield Shield matches three times Trumper was not out, and in every one of the other seven innings, Whitty dismissed the great batsman. It was ironic because Whitty had been introduced to big cricket by Trumper himself. Born in Sydney on August 15, 1886, Whitty played only junior cricket but was noticed by Trumper, and recommended for coaching and then to bowl against the State squad. At 21 he played his first match for NSW against Queensland at Sydney, took three wickets, and the following season was recruited by Clem Hill to move to Adelaide. In 1910 he bowled for the first time against Trumper, his hero, and dismissed him for 75 and a `duck'. In succeeding meetings he got Trumper for 47 and 37, then Trumper had two brief not-out innings, was dismissed by Whitty for a duck and eleven, made a brilliant 201 not out, and was finally bowled by Whitty for 25. His greatest Test success came in the home series of 1910-11 against South Africa when he took 37 wickets at an average of 17. The second Test at Melbourne saw the South Africans needing only 170 for victory-and Whitty wrecked them with an irresistible 6 for 17 off 16 overs. As well as touring England in 1909 and 1912, Whitty visited New Zealand and the U.S., Canada and Bermuda with Australian teams. He finished with 475 wickets in first-class cricket, continued playing in south-east South Australia after his retirement, and as a golf enthusiast at one stage played off scratch.\n"", ' \n']",[],14.0,19,7,161.0,39*,13.41,,,0,0,,0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,119.0,171,44,1465,81,11.53,,,0,1,,,35.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14.0,25,3357,1373,65.0,6/17,9/98,21.12,2.45,51.6,7,3,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,119.0,,24948,11491,491,8/27,,23.40,2.76,50.8,,26,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Thrown to the wolves at 20, he flailed at all bowling, sent down bouncers at Viv Richards, and tasted Ashes defeat.

It was his catharsis. Upon his recall, he minimalised his batsmanship, forgoing risk and waiting for the loose ball, which he still punished severely. He was all but forced to give up bowling by back problems.

His game was characterised by an ability to drive, cut, pull and loft the ball so effortlessly that it could make him look disdainful of the talents of bowlers. Waugh made his name as a middle-order player for New South Wales in the late 1980s, twice winning the Sheffield Shield Cricketer of the Year titles as he built and maintained a first-class average in excess of fifty. Although he lived in the shadow of his more famous brother for a number of seasons, progression to international cricket was inevitable. The only sour note when his promotion eventually came, for the fourth Test of the 1990-91 series against England, was that it arrived at Steve's expense. Critics took issue with Waugh's apparent loss of concentration at times and his capacity to occasionally succumb to lazy-looking shots. The weakness was on show most evidently during his disastrous 1992-93 tour to Sri Lanka when he scored four successive Test ducks, but it would be hard to find a player more difficult to\ncontain when in full flight. To complement his batting skills, he offered\nhandy part-time bowling as a medium-pacer-cum-offspinner and a remarkable\npenchant for spectacular saves and catches - he had few\nrivals to match his freakish brilliance in the field. His many\nhighlights included a world-record partnership of 464 for the fifth wicket with Steve for New South Wales\nagainst Western Australia in 1990-91; his sterling 138 on Test debut; three commanding centuries as an opener at\nthe 1996 World Cup tournament; and 126 to seal the Frank Worrell Trophy in West Indies in 1995. The\nlowest moment came in late 1998 when it emerged that he and Shane Warne accepted money\nfrom an Indian bookmaker during a tour of Sri Lanka four years earlier.\nA laconic, unassuming character, Waugh announced his retirement from\ninternational cricket without fuss in October 2002 after losing his\nplace in the Test squad to play England.

Despite boasting an athletic figure made for photo shoots, Watson's frame was so brittle it threatened to break him. He refused to give up. Not through recurrences of back stress fractures, hamstring strains, calf problems, hip complaints, a dislocated shoulder or a suspected heart attack that turned out to be food poisoning. He changed his training, preferring pilates to weights, gave up alcohol, but not his dream. It finally paid off in 2009, when he was chosen as a Test opener in the middle of the Ashes series. Many batsmen would have been uncomfortable with the promotion from the middle order, especially after failing when given the job with Queensland, but Watson had become used to re-inventing himself. With a history of setbacks, it was not a surprise that his first Test century became such a drama, but after two scores in the 90s and an 89, he finally brought it up at the MCG against Pakistan - thanks to a single from a dropped catch. He had earned some luck. A productive few years as a Test opener led to back-to-back Allan Border Medals but by 2011-12, injury had again interceded. He returned to the Test team in 2012 but spent the rest of his career floating up and down the order in search of a place to call his own. \n"", ""\nIn 2013, Watson became Australia's 44th Test captain when he led the team to a three-day loss in Delhi in place of the injured Michael Clarke. It completed a hectic couple of weeks for Watson, who had been suspended from the previous Test in the homework saga and had also flown home for the birth of his child. He gave up the vice-captaincy after that tour and played for another two years before being dropped during the 2015 Ashes, after which he announced his retirement from Tests. As a bowler, Watson developed into one of Australia's best exponents of reverse swing, and if he was not claiming wickets himself he was often building pressure at one end. At times his bowling saved his place in the Test team, for four centuries from 59 Tests and an average of 35.19 was a little less than he desired as a batsman. At the crease he is an aggressive brute with a broad chest, a right-handed disciple of Matthew Hayden, and someone who often doesn't need to follow-through to gain a boundary. However, his drives and pulls are delivered in a much smoother style. Always a dangerous striker in the shorter formats, Watson clubbed Bangladesh for 185 in a 50-over contest in April 2011, the highest score ever by an Australian batsman in ODI cricket.

If his bat isn't doing the talking his mouth probably is, and either way you can expect an assertive approach. One of the most destructive hitters in world cricket, Warner opens for Australia in all three formats and in 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching England's Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had also been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It also completed a remarkable rise for a man who burst on to the international scene in 2008-09 as a Twenty20 specialist; he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well. \n"", ""\nHis debut in the baggy green came, appropriately, in Test match No.2020, against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2011, and in his second match he achieved what Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden never did - he carried his bat through a Test innings. His unbeaten 123 in Hobart could not prevent a historic New Zealand win, but his patience in challenging conditions showed a different side to his batsmanship.

A charismatic, spectacular performer who made as headlines on the field and off it, he finished second-best to Muttiah Muralitharan in the Test wickets stakes, but to many he remains the greatest spinner - if not bowler - of them all.  ","['\nAt first there were nerves and chubbiness. Then came wild soaring legbreaks, followed by fame and flippers. For a long while there were women, then a bookmaker, then diet pills, then more women - and headlines, always headlines. Now he has come out the other end, his bluff and bluster and mischief and innocence somehow intact. The man who in 2000 was rated among the five greatest cricketers of the 20th century was, in 2006, bowling better than ever. \n', ""When Warne likened his life to a soap opera he was selling himself short. His story was part fairytale, part pantomime, part hospital drama, part adult's-only romp, part glittering awards ceremony. He took a Test hat-trick, won the Man-of-the-Match prize in a World Cup final and was the subject of seven books. He was the first cricketer to reach 700 Test wickets. He swatted more runs than any other Test player without making a hundred, and was probably the wiliest captain Australia never had. His ball that gazoodled Mike Gatting in 1993, bouncing outside leg stump and cuffing off, is unanimously esteemed the most famous in history. He revived legspin, thought to be extinct, and is now pre-eminent in a game so transformed that we sometimes wonder where the next champion fast bowlers will come from."", ""For all that, Warne's greatest feats are perhaps those of the last couple of years of his career. Returning in 2004 from a 12-month hiatus for swallowing forbidden diuretics, he swept aside 26 Sri Lankan batsmen in three Tests, and the following year scalped a world record 96 victims - a stunning 24 more than in his show-stopping 1993 - and still missed out on the Allan Border Medal. Forty of those were Englishmen in what sometimes appeared to be a lone stand in a thrilling Ashes series. At the end he was helped by his stockpile of straight balls: a zooter, slider, toppie and back-spinner, one that drifted in, one that sloped out, and another that didn't budge. Yet he seldom got his wrong'un right and rarely landed his flipper. More than ever he relied on his two oldest friends: excruciating accuracy and an exquisite legbreak, except that he controlled the degree of spin - and mixed it - at will. Like the great classical painters, he stumbled upon the art of simplicity. His bowling was never simpler, nor more effective, nor lovelier to look at."", ""Maybe, as with Posh Spice or Kylie Minogue, Warne is more famous than he is loved. Maybe we didn't fully appreciate his genius until he quit at the end of the 2006-07 Ashes series when he achieved his final goal, the reclaiming of the urn; maybe, like Bradman's, it will become ever more apparent with the passing of decades. One thing's for sure, though.

Small, cheeky, popular and multi-skilled, he would drink all night without getting drunk then wipe sleep from his eyes to make a shot-laden century or take a crucial wicket or stunning catch - sometimes, in folklore at least, on the same day. Sometimes cricket is not even the tale's focus. Michael Clarke, who is often compared to Walters, knows him only as a great bloke instead of a great batsman. It is a shame. He was more than a person whose card games were interrupted by falls of wicket. \n"", 'Walters, the country boy with the bush technique, was a knockabout who disliked training and going to bed early, and favoured drinking, smoking, solitaire and cribbage. Quick on to the back foot against the spinners, he was a fine straight-driver and hooker, and a valuable partnership breaker with his medium pace. Crowds relaxed and related to his instinctive and aggressive Test batting that three times brought up centuries in a session, the most famous arriving when he smacked the last ball of the day from Bob Willis for six at the WACA in 1974-75. He could play pressure innings as well, like the 112 against West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1972-93, when Lance Gibbs had three short-legs by 35 minutes on day one and Walters scored 100 between lunch and tea. ""By any standards it was a magnificent innings,"" ', ' reported. The grit never stuck to his stories, forcing him to open his autobiography with a spoiler. ""It rather amuses me when journalists refer to me as happy-go-lucky and unflappable. I feel the pressures and tensions as much as the next bloke.""', ""Growing up on a Dungog dairy farm in country New South Wales, Walters stepped from the paddock into first-class cricket at 17, where he faced the great Wes Hall and reached 50. Like Clarke, he made a century on debut two years later. A second Ashes hundred came in the next match as he followed 155 with 22 and 115 in a sparkling start that was upturned in 1966 by conscription for two years' national service. He was not called up for duty in Vietnam, and smoothly swapped training greens to whites. Re-sealing his place with 699 runs in four matches against West Indies in 1968-69, he became the first player to make a double-hundred and a hundred in a Test."", 'Walters was a fixture of the team until 1977, his fourth Ashes tour, and he joined World Series Cricket, playing most of his matches upcountry, before a surprise recall against India in 1980-81. Missing out on a century in England remains his career\'s biggest hole. Using a high back-lift and a light bat, he was susceptible to the swinging ball, and retired after being overlooked for the 1981 Ashes tour. However, his highest score came in the similar conditions of New Zealand. Celebrating his first century overnight, the tour manager was called in the early hours because the hotelier wanted the bar closed. Walters backed up the following evening after reaching 250 from 342 balls and putting on 217 with the No. 8 Gary Gilmour. Another time he borrowed a spectator\'s bike to ride from third-man at each end after being punished by Ian Chappell for oversleeping. There are so many Walters stories that many of them must be true, and as a man of the people he was rewarded with a stand on the old SCG hill. ""There will never be another like him,"" Dennis Lillee said. ""I never saw him throw a bat, never heard him talk badly of anyone. He was so cool."" He could bat, too.

(NSW went on to win by 98 runs.) Swinging the ball in a stiff breeze, Wall took the last nine wickets after lunch - four in one over - for five runs.

He was relentlessly competitive, invariably aggressive, and as hard and uncompromising as the new ball. After an international career that lasted almost 15 years, the end was desperately unfortunate, as Boucher was forced to announce his retirement after being hit in the eye by a bail in a warm-up game on the tour to England in 2012, which would have been his last series anyway. Boucher finished with 998 international dismissals as a wicketkeeper, including 555 in 147 Tests. \n', ""Boucher's start in international cricket was uncertain. His relative lack of pure wicketkeeping skill and ability was exposed on South Africa's 1998 tour to England when he was repeatedly undone by the swing of the ball after it had pitched. However, Boucher had no peer in terms of temperament, guts and determination, and he duly fashioned himself into one of the finest glovemen in the game. He could often be seen, long after the rest of the squad had hit the showers after a training session, willing himself through another set of wicketkeeping drills. The hard work paid off, and he is likely to hold the record for Test dismissals - among many others - long after his retirement.

His most memorable innings was probably the scintillating unbeaten 50 he scored to complete South Africa's surge to a series-clinching target of 438 for 9 off the penultimate ball of a one-day international against Australia in Johannesburg in March 2006.

He worked furiously on his bowling as a result, and match-winning analyses in both India and Sri Lanka finally established him as the Test No. 1 in 2000-01, a position he briefly surrendered to Claude Henderson in Australia in 2001-02, and then to Robin Peterson and Paul Adams in 2003. However, he had a big role to play in the final Test of the New Zealand tour of 2003-04, when his eight-wicket haul helped South Africa to a series-levelling win. But after being implicated in the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal in 2000, Boje refused to tour India in subsequent years. After fighting his way back into the squad to face India in 2006, he surprisingly announced his retirement from international cricket to concentrate on his domestic career with the Eagles. He went on to play in the ""rebel"" ICL and in 2008 was appointed captain of Northamptonshire, handing over the reins to Andrew Hall after a stuttering start to the 2010 season. He was one of the bright, inquisitive breed of internationals who preferred a cameraman\'s long lens to a boring dressing-room and a craft market or temple to a hotel room.

He combined speed, perfect balance and a quite exceptional throwing arm, and thrilled spectators and intimidated opposing batsmen in equal measure.  Even in the modern era, when outstanding fielders are more commonplace, Bland would have stood out.  He honed his skills by endless practice throwing at a single stump, and later on he used this to show off his skills to the public during team fielding sessions . Much as was the case with Jonty Rhodes in the 1990s, even if Bland did not perform with the bat, he was worth an extra 20-30 runs for his fielding alone.  But he could bat, even if he was often undone by a tendency to try and loft the ball bacl over the bowler's head.  In 1963-64 in Australia he scored 126 at Sydney, ending the series with 367 runs at 61.16, and followed with 207 runs at 69.00 in New Zealand.  Against  England in 1964-65 he was again at his best, hammering 144 at Johannesburg and his 572 runs came at 71.50.   In England the following summer he made 906 runs, including 286 at 47.66 in the three Tests.   On that tour, which was South Africa's last series against England for 29 years, Bland's fielding was a revelation wherever he went, and his run-outs of Ken Barrington and Jim Parks  at Lord's turned the match.   His Test career ended tragically at Johannesburg against Australia in 1966-67, when he crashed into a boundary fence while chasing the ball, badly damaging his left knee.  In domestic cricket he was no less popular, and equally effective.  In 1967-68 he smashed 197 in three hours for Rhodesia against Border in a low-scoring match on a poor wicket which highlighted his class.    He was also a very useful medium-fast right-arm bowler who was probably underused.

With his wristy leg-side flick and serene cover drive, Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket, while also effectively shifting gears to become the fastest batsman to 2,000 (40 innings), 3,000 (57 innings), 4,000 (81 innings) and 5,000 (101 innings) runs in ODI cricket.  \n"", ""Amla's career began at Durban High School, the alma mater of Lance Klusener and Barry Richards, and a world away from his brother, Ahmed. Just four years apart, they grew up on either side of the Apartheid divide, which meant that Ahmed went to a school for the previously disadvantaged, while Amla was afforded better opportunity at a more prestigious institution. "", 'After a successful school career, Amla toured New Zealand with the South African Under-19 team in 2000-01 and captained them at the 2002 Under-19 World Cup. After reeling off four centuries in his first eight innings of the 2004-05 season - in which he was also appointed, and stepped down as, Dolphins captain - he was picked to play for South Africa against India.  ', 'He was not an instant success, with serious questions emerging about his technique and his back lift, in particular, as he mustered 36 runs in four innings against England later that season.', ""When he was handed a second chance, he made it count with 149 against New Zealand at Cape Town, helping South Africa to a draw. He remained a consistent performer, even if not as prolific as South Africa would have liked, and made fifties against Pakistan in 2007. But he saved his best for the following year's tour of India, where he racked up 307 runs in three Tests. That included a majestic 159 in Chennai, his second score of 150 or more. He followed that with a pugnacious 81 in the second innings, in conditions that were trying, thanks to the weather, the pitch and the attack. In the summer of 2008, he got his name on the honours board at Lord's with a sublime century, and, in the process, silenced all whimpers about his pedigree for the longest version."", 'Still, doubts remained over his ability in the shorter formats, but Amla corrected that in 2010. He scored over 1,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket.  It started with a magnum opus tour of India, where the hosts threw everything at him, but could not find a way past his monk-like patience and ability to soak pressure. In the two-Test series, he scored 490 runs and was dismissed just once. In ODIs, he combined quick scoring with stunning consistency, scoring five centuries and four fifties in 15 innings, all the while scoring at over a run a ball, which saw him rise to No.1 in the ODI rankings that year.', ""He was promoted to South Africa's leadership core when he was named vice-captain of the ODI and T20 international teams in June 2011, and later that year, scored centuries in both Tests South Africa played against Australia at home. But Amla's crowning moment came the following year, when he got South Africa's quest to become the No.1-ranked Test team off to an epic start, spending 13 hours and 10 minutes at the Oval crease crafting a triple hundred, and not even needing a change of gloves. Amla also scored a century at Lord's as South Africa took the Test mace from the hosts. "", ""A quickfire 196 against Australia in Perth ensured South Africa stayed on top, and in February 2013, Amla was the ICC's top-ranked Test batsman. He had also decided to keep away from captaincy promotions, and stepped down as the limited-overs vice-captain. "", 'That was why it came as a surprise when, less than 18 months later, Amla accepted the Test captaincy. His tenure was off to a solid start as South Africa beat Sri Lanka 1-0 away from home in his first series in charge, and West Indies at home in his second, in which Amla scored a double hundred in the first match. But that proved a false dawn.', ""Amla had taken over a team in transition and South Africa's struggles came in 2015. They lost a four-Test series in India 3-0 and returned home to lose the opening Test against England. Amla's own form also suffered and he had not crossed fifty in a year. The New Year's Test of 2016 brought a change of fortune as he scored a double hundred, having decided to give up captaincy.

He came out second best in his duels with Shane Warne, but although much was made of the animosity between the two, a more sober assessment of Cullinan suggests that his failures on two Australian tours were largely the result of an almost desperate desire to prove himself against a cricketing nation he holds in high regard. In other words, Cullinan tried just too hard to succeed against Australia. Against all other attacks in all kinds of conditions he scored runs, as demonstrated by his century in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Galle in 2000 when his hundred came against Muttiah Mularitharan, the world\'s best offspinner, operating on a turning track. In 1994, when South Africa were decimated by Devon Malcolm and bowled out for 175, Cullinan made a graceful 94 and was the only South African not to lose his wicket to Malcolm. Equally adept against pace or spin, Cullinan had the priceless gift of timing. He made even a forward defensive prod look stylish. He took some time, it is true, to shake off a reputation earned as a schoolboy as the ""new Graeme Pollock"", a label tagged on him when he broke Pollock\'s record as South Africa\'s youngest first-class centurion. During the 1990s, however, Cullinan set the South African mark for the highest first-class score (337 not out against Northern Transvaal in 1993) and at Eden Park in 1999 he edged past Pollock\'s highest Test score of 274 by one run to claim the then South African record. Cullinan made 14 Test hundreds in all. More importantly, he accepted the role of senior batsman, and it is surely no coincidence that when he scored first-innings hundreds in the first and fourth Tests against England in 1999-00, South Africa went on to win both matches. Cullinan tried to opt out of one-day cricket at the end of the 2001 season, but the board, understandably, put pressure on him to sign a new two-year contract. However, he retired from all international cricket in 2002 under a cloud of dispute with the board. Recalled that season to play Australia after recovering from a knee injury and a lack of form, he suddenly withdrew from the team on the eve of the second Test. It was later revealed that the board had had been unable to meet certain demands made by Cullinan. He subsequently retracted his retirement, but the board found itself able to resist the temptation to bring him back. In 2007, Cullinan took up a coaching role with the ICL.

The double-hundred - next highest score was Gerry Liebenberg's 39 -\nremained Cronje's best."", ""This was a period of transition for Australian fast bowling, though. Cronje was given\na harder time in England in 1994 and managed only 90 runs in six Test innings as\nDevon Malcolm and the young Darren Gough exposed a technical weakness against\nshort-pitched bowling directed at his ribs. Spin gave him no such problems, and his\narmoury against it included a ferocious slog-sweep over mid-wicket, played on one\nknee. When he made what was then Test cricket's third-fastest fifty, off 31 balls at\nCenturion in 1997-98, he reached it by hitting Muttiah Muralitharan, the world's best\noff-spinner, for 4666 off successive balls."", 'In 1995, he expunged his unhappy introduction to English conditions by making\n1,362 first-class runs at 50.44 in a one-off season for Leicestershire, whose cricket\nmanager Jack Birkenshaw and all-rounder Gordon Parsons, Cronje\'s brother-in-law\nsince 1991, participated in Orange Free State\'s triumphs.

But it would take him ten Tests and\nuntil 1998 to reach 50 against England, whereupon he did so five times on the trot: 81 in South Africa\'s win at Lord\'s, 69 not out at Old Trafford, 126 and 67 at Trent\nBridge, and 57 (plus a duck) at Headingley, where England took the series 2-1 with\nhelp from some inept umpiring. He was South Africa\'s top-scorer, with 401 runs at\n66.83, but it was generally accepted that his unenterprising captaincy had let the rubber\nslip away. Instead of penetration he went for strangulation, setting defensive fields for\nhis seam bowlers and encouraging them to bowl wide of off stump: what Bob Woolmer, South Africa\'s coach, called ""aggressive containment"".', ""Yet when Cronje succeeded Wessels in 1994-95, and began the partnership with\nWoolmer that masterminded South Africa's tactics until the 1999 World Cup, he was\nwelcomed as an adventurous captain; one prepared to gamble. In his first series, against New Zealand in South Africa, he became the first captain since W. G. Grace to win a three-match rubber after being one down. When the teams met again at Auckland\nin March 1995, Cronje's pre-lunch declaration, setting New Zealand 275 to win in 63\novers, was the catalyst for South Africa's 93-run victory. Something saturnine in his\ndemeanour, however, spoke of arrogance and calculated self-control; his dour expression suggested few concessions to humour or emotion. Yet there were times when the composure snapped. "", ""Shortly after becoming South Africa's captain, he received a onematch ban for dissent on dismissal in a Castle Cup game. When the umpires rightly ruled Mark Waugh not out after inadvertently hitting his wicket at Adelaide in 1997-98, and he went on to save the Test, Cronje hurled a stump through their dressingroom door. At Cape Town in 1995-96, he was fined for imposing his will on umpire Dave Orchard to refer a run-out to the television umpire after Orchard ruled England's Graham Thorpe not out; the decision was overturned and South Africa went on to take the match and the series."", 'He could certainly be articulate and persuasive. The England bowler Angus Fraser\nrecalled him holding an audience in thrall for 40 minutes, without notes, and reciting\n""word for word"" from Hamlet. ""His pre-match talks were often inspirational,"" Woolmer\nsaid, ""and he led from the front."" His players revered him. The Western Province seamer Craig Matthews credited Cronje with changing his life: ""He actually persuaded me that I was good enough to play international cricket."" At Cronje\'s funeral, Shaun\nPollock, his successor as national captain, spoke of his love of practical jokes, often\nused to make newcomers feel at home. Pollock recounted being told to field next to\na certain sponsor\'s advert, only to discover the sponsor had boards scattered all round\nthe ground. As with most great leaders, Cronje\'s personality comprised a complex\nskein of qualities.', ""His captaincy record brooks few arguments. South Africa won 27 and lost only 11\nof his 53 Tests in charge, with series victories over every opponent except Australia;\nin 138 one-day internationals there were 99 wins, as well as a tie. His record made\na nonsense of the South African board's decision to appoint him for only the first two\nTests against England in 1999-2000, even allowing for a downturn in his form and\nhis apprehensions about the UCBSA's politically motivated policy of selection on\nracial quotas. Although he was later confirmed as captain for all the Tests and\none-day games, his take on the turn of events was apparent in his brooding presence\nand the fact that he openly flirted with an offer to succeed Duncan Fletcher as\nGlamorgan coach."", ""He was still coming to terms, too, with that cataclysmic tie against Australia that\ncost South Africa a place in the 1999 World Cup final and dashed his boyhood dreams\nof leading his country to World Cup glory. With one run needed to win their semi-\nfinal, and three balls still in hand, South Africa's last pair, Lance Klusener and Donald,\ncontrived the most fatal of run-outs. Cronje, who had been given out for a duck caught\noff his boot, was magnanimous in defeat as ever, but nothing could mask his anguish.\nAustralia remained his bête noire."", ""He did outdo his Australian rivals Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh in winning a Test\nseries in India, in 2000. South Africa won 2-0 and ended India's sequence of 14\nunbeaten home series since 1987. But in that moment of triumph the seeds of his\ntragedy were quickly taking root. Ensnared in illicit dealings with sub-continental\nbookmakers after Mohammad Azharuddin introduced him to the match-fixer M. K.\nGupta on South Africa's previous tour of India, in 1996, Cronje was now in cahoots\nwith Sanjeev Chawla. Cronje unsuccessfully approached Pieter Strydom to underperform"", ""in the First Test; before the Second he asked Mark Boucher, Jacques Kallis\nand Klusener if they were interested in throwing the game for money. They put it down\nas another of Hansie's practical jokes. It was not until the final one-day game at Nagpur\nthat he struck lucky, getting Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams to play to plan for\n$US15,000 apiece. Gibbs was supposed to be out for less than 20 and Williams to\nconcede more than 50. That the plan went awry was ethically immaterial. He had lured\ntwo non-white players, the most vulnerable of his charges in socio-economic terms, at\nthe very time he was supporting South Africa's development programme to bring young\nblack cricketers into the first-class game. When it emerged that he told Chawla he\nneeded $US25,000 for each player, so guaranteeing himself a $US20,000 cut, Cronje's\ngreed was compliant with his guilt. Gibbs and Williams subsequently received sixmonth suspensions from international cricket."", ""Granted immunity from prosecution, Cronje told the King Commission he received\naround $US140,000 from bookmakers, including $US110,000 from Gupta for information on team selection, daily forecasts and when he would declare against India at Cape Town in January 1997. He denied ever fixing the actual result of a match. He\nalso admitted telling the South African team, before the Mohinder Amarnath benefit\ngame at Mumbai in December 1996, that there was $US200,000 (some sources said\n$250,000) on the table if they played badly. The team actually debated whether to\naccept the money before rejecting it; no one reported the matter to the authorities.\nSome of them thought the offer of a bribe reflected South Africa's coming of age in\ninternational cricket."", 'When Cronje rejected further advances from Gupta in November 1997, that might\nhave ended his perfidy. But, as he told Justice King, he had ""an unfortunate love of\nmoney... I am not addicted to alcohol or nicotine, but I believe this is very similar to\nan alcohol problem."" Even so, it was small beer, certainly in terms of personal gain,\nthat made him come off the wagon in January 2000. In response to a late-night\nvisit from a South African bookmaker, Marlon Aronstam, he persuaded Nasser Hussain\nto make a match of the rain-ruined Centurion Test on the fifth day with a double\nforfeiture of innings - something not only without precedent in Test history but also\noutside the Laws. Aronstam had planned to back both sides at long odds and, even\nthough the forfeiture deal was struck too late for him to place his bets, Cronje was\ngiven 53,000 rand (approximately £5,000) and a leather jacket for his wife. He was\nalso acclaimed for his enterprising captaincy by unsuspecting commentators who\nwelcomed England\'s win - South Africa had already taken the series - as a victory\nfor common sense and the game. A fortnight later Cronje was meeting Chawla in\nDurban and leaving his hotel room with some $US15,000 tucked in a mobile-phone\ncontainer. The die was cast. Neither Justice King nor many others believed they had heard the full story, but enough was known for Cronje to receive a life ban from all cricketing activities. The Qayyum Report had already recommended a life ban for Pakistan\'s former captain Salim Malik; India\'s Azharuddin and Ajay Sharma would receive similar sentences before the year was out. And the ICC would eventually publish their own report into corruption in the game and implement a range of measures designed to keep the bookmakers at bay.', 'Meanwhile the most intriguing question - why he did it - remained an enigma. In\nmulti-media interviews between his testimony and his ban in October, reputed to\nhave netted a further £100,000, Cronje talked of ""greed, stupidity and the lure of\neasy money"" and claimed ""I was arrogant enough to think I would get away with it"".\nA born-again Christian who wore a bracelet with the initials WWJD - What Would\nJesus Do? - he talked of how Satan had entered his world when he took his eyes\noff Jesus and his ""whole world turned dark"". There was something pre-Christian in\nthis, an echo of Greek heroes blaming the gods rather than themselves for their\nmisfortunes.', 'Cronje\'s appeal against his life ban was rejected by the Pretoria High Court in\nOctober 2001, and while there was talk of his having some future role in cricket,\nmaybe coaching or in the media, he began to build a life away from the game. He\nenrolled on a Masters degree course, and in February 2002 joined the Johannesburgbased firm Bell Equipment, which specialised in earth-moving machinery, as financial manager. At the time of his death he was commuting weekly to and from his home on the exclusive Fancourt Estate in George. That fateful weekend, he had hitched a ride with the two pilots of an Air Quarius Hawker Siddeley turboprop after his scheduled flight had been grounded by a hailstorm - a risk-taker to the end.\nMore than a thousand mourners filled the Grey College Chapel for Cronje\'s funeral,\nwhile a thousand more outside watched the service, which was televised nationally, on\nlarge screens. It was reported that members of the UCBSA, critical earlier of their\ncaptain\'s betrayal, had been told they would not be welcome, but Bertha Cronje,\nHansie\'s widow, said he would not have agreed with such a ban. The divisions were\nforgotten as South Africa, a nation rebuilding on forgiveness and reconciliation,\nmourned, in Gary Kirsten\'s words, ""a great cricketer, a great performer and a great\non-field leader of his country"". It was elsewhere that cricket would still consider Hansie\nCronje a tarnished hero.']",[],68.0,111.0,9.0,3714.0,135,36.41,8320.0,44.63,6.0,23.0,409.0,33.0,33.0,0.0,188.0,175,31,5565.0,112,38.64,7277,76.47,2,39,366,94,73.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,184.0,310,33,12103,251,43.69,,,32,57,,,121.0,0.0,304.0,285,52,9862,158,42.32,,,9,69,,,105.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,68.0,85,3800,1288,43.0,3/14,5/34,29.95,2.03,88.3,0,0,0,188.0,153,5357,3966,114.0,5/32,5/32,34.78,4.44,46.9,1,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,184.0,,9897,3995,116,4/47,,34.43,2.42,85.3,,0,0,304.0,,7651,5696,170,5/32,5/32,33.50,4.46,45.0,1,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,True,False,True

Cook was schooled at the King Edward VII School, two years below Graeme Smith and the pair occasionally opened the batting together. While Smith was aggressive and unorthodox in his approach, Cook was as correct as they come, with a serene cover drive and a confident pull shot in his repertoire. \n', ""Cook made his provincial debut the season after Smith, in the 2000/01 season in which he also played for South Africa's under-19 team. He was part of the age-group side that competed in the 2002 World Cup, alongside both Smith and Hashim Amla. Cook finished as South Africa's second highest run-scorer and only centurion at the event but unlike Smith and Amla, it would be many years before he would make his mark higher up. "", ""In a strong Gauteng and later Lions set-up, Cook had to fight for a place as a regular in the early years, but by the mid-2000s had established himself as a reliable opener. In the 2008-9 season, he shattered the South African first-class record for the highest individual score. In a marathon innings of two minutes short of 14 hours at the crease, Cook scored 390, eclipsing Daryll Cullinan's 337 scored sixteen before. Cook was also part of a 365-run sixth-wicket stand with Thami Tsolekile, also a record in South African cricket. That season Cook entered the first-class top ten run-scorers list and he stayed there for seven seasons, without a national call-up. "", ""The following summer, 2009-10, he notched up over 1000 first-class runs, a feat seldom achieved in South Africa's six-franchise system. He was promoted to Lions' four-day captain ahead of the 2014-15 season, in which he led them to the trophy and topped the run-charts."", 'Recognition finally came in January 2016, sixteen years after he made his domestic debut, when Cook was named in the South African XI to play England in the Centurion Test. The wait was worth it. He became the sixth South African to score a century on debut and guided the team to their only victory of the four-match series.

South Africa were given no chance of holding an Australian side which was led by Hassett and included Harvey, Lindwall, Morris, Miller and Johnston. In the event the Test series was drawn, at two matches all,  South Africa winning the final Test at  Melbourne after  Australia had scored 520 in their first innings. Much of the credit for a notable South African achievement on this tour belonged to  Cheetham, not because of the runs he made (he was a batsman pure and simple) but because of the way, with the help of the manager, Ken Viljoen, himself a former Test cricketer, he welded the players into a team. There were those at the time who thought the  Cheetham-Viljoen regime too authoritarian; in fact, though, it was a sign of things to come.

July 5, 1905, Port Elizabeth, Cape Province ","November 2, 1935, Joubert Park, Johannesburg (aged 30 years 120 days) ",,"['South Africa,', 'Eastern Province,', 'Transvaal,', 'Western Province']",,,,,Right-hand bat,,,,,"[""\nHorace Brakenridge Cameron, one of the finest wicket-keepers South Africa has produced and a courageous, hard-hitting batsman, died on November 2, 1935, shortly after his return home with the victorious team that toured England. Born at Port Elizabeth on July 5, 1905, he was in his 31st year when enteric fever proved fatal after only a few days' illness. Educated at Hilton College, Natal, and Jeppe High School, Johannesburg, Cameron began to take a keen interest in cricket when no more than ten years old. He received plenty of encouragement at school to develop skill in keeping wicket, and after getting a place in the Transvaal eleven he soon came right to the front both as batsman and wicket-keeper. Following his debut against the Hon. L. H. Tennyson's team in 1924-25, he was quick to establish himself as a potential Test player. He made his first hundred in important cricket--132 against Eastern Province--in 1927, and selected the same season to play for South Africa he took part, with success, in all five games against England. Coming to this country in 1929 when he began the tour with a century against Worcestershire, Cameron fully lived up to his reputation as a wicket-keeper--one of his best performances was in the game with Somerset when he caught six batsmen and stumped one. In all matches during that visit he scored 1,077 runs for an average of 32.63. \n"", ""When batting in the Test match at Lord's, he met with a nasty accident. A good length ball from Larwood rose abruptly and struck Cameron on the head, rendering him unconscious; the effects of the injury prevented him playing again for three weeks or so. When the M.C.C. team went to South Africa in 1930-31, Cameron was appointed captain for the Fourth Test Match--the third change in the leadership in four games. He marked the occasion with a splendid fighting innings of 69 not out, and at the close South Africa needed 37 runs to win with three wickets in hand. The cares of captaincy, however, appeared to weigh heavily upon him when he led the South African team in Australia the following winter. Although he maintained a high standard in wicket-keeping, he was nothing like so successful with the bat, his ten innings in the Test matches producing no more than 155 runs and his aggregate for the whole tour being only 642. Last summer, on his second visit to England when he acted as vice-captain, Cameron stood out as one of the great personalities of the South African team. Most memorable of the many fine innings he played was that at Lord's when by his plucky batting he demoralised England bowlers who before he went in had got rid of four batsmen for 98 runs. Cameron's powerful driving and pulling captured the imagination of everyone; in the course of an hour and three-quarters he scored 90 out of 126. Against Yorkshire, he hit one over from Verity for 30 runs and at Scarborough he finished the tour with another superb display of joyous batting in an innings of 160."", 'In no sense could Cameron be described as a mere slogger. He combined fine technique with calculated hitting; when necessary he could adapt his game and discipline himself to the need for more restrained methods. Always a firm believer in making the bat hit the ball, he came down much harder on it than the average batsman. Blessed with power of wrist and forearms, he could drive and pull without appearing to use very much effort. In the Tests last summer he scored 306 runs (average 38) and for all games his aggregate was 1,655 and his average 41.37.', ""Cameron, for all his fearless hitting, will be chiefly remembered for his high place among wicket-keepers not only of South Africa but in his generation. His stumping of a batsman has been likened to the nonchalant gesture of a smoker flicking the ash from a cigarette--an apt simile of the speed and art of his deeds. Cameron's concentration upon his job was always evident; some of his stumping efforts dazzled the eyesight. To place him second only as a wicket-keeper to Oldfield is not undue praise. He was neither flamboyant nor noisy and he took the ball cleanly; in fact, his style may be described as the perfection of ease and rapidity without unnecessary show. Last season he stumped 21 batsmen and caught 35; in the Final Test when only six England wickets fell he made two catches and stumped Hammond and Leyland beautifully. Cameron was a very fine personality, one who enriched the game and whose manliness and popularity extended far beyond the cricket field. The passing of this charming fellow was a cruel loss not only to the game but to all who knew him.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1936'],26.0,45.0,4.0,1239.0,90,30.21,,,0.0,10.0,,11.0,39.0,12.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,107.0,161,17,5396,182,37.47,,,11,28,,,155.0,69.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,107.0,,16,13,0,-,-,-,4.87,-,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

A classical action and top-drawer pace would have won him a place in any side in his prime, and for much of his career he was the only world-class performer in the South African team, spearing the ball in, shaping it away and always making things happen. His strike rate was below 50 in Tests and close to 30 in one-day internationals. Inevitably, he was over-bowled and the injuries began to accumulate in the twilight of his career. He quit Test cricket after breaking down in the crushing defeat by Australia at Johannesburg in 2001-02,  retired from ODIs a year later, after South Africa's exit from the 2003 World Cup, and from all cricket a year later as his physical deterioration accelerated.

No living South African player, past or present, commands as much respect from the public and his peers as Donald, the first bowler from his country to take 300 Test wickets. He transferred his huge knowledge of quick bowling to the commentary box and coaching and took up the role of bowling coach with England in 2007.

AB de Villiers has emerged as one of South Africa's greats. \n"", ' \nDe Villiers is a 360-degree batsman who can hit any ball, anywhere, against any bowler. Indeed, his range of inventive shots has grown as his career has unfolded. He has been ranked among the top Test and ODI batsmen in the world and has established a cult-like following in T20 cricket, where his performances in the IPL have earned him a legion of Indian fans. ', 'De Villiers made his Test debut against England in 2004 (in the same match as Dale Steyn), when he was picked after just 16 first-class matches. He opened the batting in that match. He was later moved into the middle order and asked to keep wicket. That would become the story of his career. De Villiers has batted everywhere from No.1 to No.8 and performed well in most of those positions. ', ""After a brief slump in form in 2006 and 2007, de Villiers' returned early in 2008 with a blistering 103 not out off 109 balls in Durban against West Indies. Later that year, he became the first South African to score a double-century against India with his undefeated 217 at Ahmedabad. He topped that up with 174 at Leeds in South Africa's first series win in England since readmission and a 106* against Australia in Perth in the country's first series win in Australia post-readmission. That was de Villiers' best Test year, with 1061 runs at 58.94. "", 'He first came close to that again in 2010, when he scored 996 runs in the calendar year. His 278* against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi gave him the highest individual score by a South African in Test cricket (Hashim Amla later scored a triple-century). That same year, de Villiers also struck three successive ODI centuries - two against India and one against West Indies. ', ""The second time he came within touching distance of four figures in a Test calendar year was in 2013 when he scored 933 runs to ensure South Africa kept the Test mace they won in 2012. By then, de Villiers had also accepted the responsibility of full-time Test gloveman after Mark Boucher's retirement, as well as the ODI and T20 captaincy after Graeme Smith stepped down. He later handed over the T20 reigns to Faf du Plessis. "", ""De Villiers blossomed with the additional responsibility, even as concerns over a chronic back injury grew. He was relieved from keeping in shorter formats to concentrate on captaincy when Quinton de Kock was included in South African squad. By 2014, he had also handed the Test keeper's gloves to de Kock. That seemed a sensible decision because Smith retired in March that year and de Villiers was believed to be the natural successor. However, he was overlooked in favour of Amla."", 'That did nothing to dim de Villiers\' resolve. He came back with even more striking power than before and in January 2015 broke the record for the fastest ODI century, reaching it in just 31 balls against West Indies at the Wanderers. That was the loudest warning cry he could have made for South Africa\'s chances at the 2015 World Cup, but it proved a false one. Despite inspirational leadership from de Villiers, who routinely called his team ""the best"" at the tournament, South Africa bowed out at semi-final stage.', ""  \nThe one stage de Villiers did not set alight was international T20 cricket, where he often found himself batting too low in the line-up and with not enough time to make an impact. He rectified that through the IPL, where he was one of the Royal Challengers Bangalore's most successful players. In a memorable match in the 2014 edition of the competition, de Villiers smacked his countryman Steyn for 23 runs in one over. "", '\nWith de Villiers in high demand from foreign leagues, his workload became a talking point in the 2015-16 summer when he suggested he would have to look at ways to lighten the load.

A year later, he had established himself in all three formats.  \n"", ""De Kock grew up as a baseball player and even considered a move to the United States, but his father convinced him to pursue cricket instead. He attended King Edward VII High School, the alma mater of Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie, and was picked for the South African Under-19 side, which he captained briefly. The leadership mantle was taken away ahead of the 2012 World Cup in Australia in order for him to concentrate on his batting.

"", ""He was selected for South Africa's T20I series against New Zealand in 2012-13 to keep wickets in place of AB de Villiers, who asked to be rested.

Early in 2014, de Kock made his Test debut after Alviro Petersen took ill, but was only given a permanent place later that year, on a tour to Sri Lanka. He scored two half-centuries in his next three Tests, but then tore ankle ligaments during warm-up in a Test against West Indies in December.

He will always be remembered for his fine leadership of the young teams of 1927-28 and 1929, and there can be no doubt that his inspiration and careful team-building were chiefly responsible for the improvement in South African cricket of recent years. Born at Eshowe, Zululand on July 21, 1895, Deane, an attractive batsman, who scored fast when set, and a brilliant fieldsman, especially at cover, played for Natal for a few seasons after the Great War and for Transvaal from 1923. A member of the 1924 team in England he played in all five Test matches, but did nothing outstanding. After captaining the Currie Cup-winning Transvaal teams of 1925-26 and 1926-27, he was appointed captain of South Africa against the English touring team of 1927-28, and, after the first two Tests had been lost, and the third drawn, the last two were won largely owing to his fine tactics. Deane won the toss in all five Tests, which were played on matting, and in the 2nd, 4th and 5th games, he sent England in first, so that his young team would know what they had to beat, and he triumphantly justified his policy. In the third match he scored 77 and 73, putting up a record Test partnership with E. P. Nupen in each innings. His leadership of the young and inexperienced side that toured England in 1929 increased his reputation, and the team did much better against the chief sides than expected. In the fifth Test match at the Oval Deane won the toss and sent in England, who could make only 258. With three wickets down for 25 runs Deane joined H. W. Taylor, and they added 214, the captain scoring a courageous 93. England recovered well, but the honours went to South Africa. Deane retired from first-class cricket after this tour, in which he scored 1,239 runs, average 34.41. Persuaded to captain South Africa again, in 1930, he found himself so much out of form that he resigned after playing in the second and third Tests. In the Currie Cup competitions, Deane scored 1,082 runs, average 37.31, the highest three centuries being 165 for Transvaal against O.F.S. in 1923-24. He took a prominent part in the administration of the game, and was a member of the committees that selected the South African teamsof 1929, 1930-31 and 1931-32.\n', ' \n']",['Son of H.P.

Considered fortunate to have been picked for the 1929 South African cricket tour to England, with only nine first-class matches behind him, in which he had limited success, Dalton, by late-summer, was giving every sign of developing into a very good, attacking, middle-order batsman. Against Kent at Canterbury, towards the end of August, he scored 157 and 116 not out, followed by 102 and 44 not out against Sussex at Hove and 59 against Sir Julien Cahn's XI at West Bridgford. On returning to South Africa, Dalton quickly established himself as an extremely fine cricketer. He was an automatic choice for the South African tour to Australasia in 1931-32, where he averaged 32.41 with the bat, his best score being 100 against Tasmania at Launceston. He played in two Tests in Australia and two in New Zealand, in the first of which, at Christchurch, he made 82. By the end of the 1934-35 season he had become one of South Africa's most reliable batsmen, having averaged 54.76 in first-class matches since returning from New Zealand. His bowling, too, came on tremendously during this period: in 1934-35 he captured 25 wickets at 19.08 each with his leg-breaks. \n"", ""The value of having taken him to England in 1929, when only 22, was reflected in his performances on his return there in 1935. So well did he play that by the end of the tour he had scored 1,446 runs at an average of 37.07, including his First Test hundred at The Oval. With the wickets of Wyatt and Hammond in England's first innings he also contributed valuably to South Africa's famous victory at Lord's, their first over England in England. Despite a decline in form over the next couple of years, he was back to his best for the visit of W. R. Hammond's MCC side to South Africa in 1938-39, averaging 44 in the Test series, including 102 in the First Test at Johannesburg (the last Test hundred to be scored by a South African at the old Wanderers Ground), and, for good measure, hitting 110 for Natal against the Englishmen at Pietermaritzburg and three times taking the important wicket of Hammond, once in the First Test and twice ( stumped) in the timeless fifth. His ninth-wicket partnership of 137 with A. B. C. Langton, against England at The Oval in 1935, still stood as a record when South Africa last played Test cricket."", ""After two post-war seasons for Natal, Dalton concentrated on golf, a game which he also played with great distinction for many years, winning the South African Amateur Championship in 1950 and representing them in the first Commonwealth Tournament at St Andrew's in 1954. He had taken to golf in Australia in 1931-32 when, having had his jaw broken in the match after making his hundred against Tasmania, he was unable for some weeks to play cricket. His mentor at the time was Ivo Whitton, who, as an amateur, won a record number of Australian Open Championships. Dalton was also a fine bowls player, hard to beat at both tennis and table tennis, an accomplished pianist and the possessor of a fine baritone voice. He led many a sing-song on board the "", ', bound for England in 1929. A lovable character, he made the most of his many talents.\n', ""ONE of those South Africans who have excelled at several sports, as if born to them, Eric Londesbrough Dalton, who died in Durban on June 3, at the age of 74, toured England twice before the war, as well as Australasia once, playing in 15 Test matches. His first was during the 1929 England tour, when he gave a glimpse of things to come right at the end, following his maiden first-class century with another in the second innings against Kent, and stringing a third to them in the next match at Hove. His first major contribution to a Test match came 21/2 years later, at Christchurch, when he scored 82 in South Africa's first-ever Test against New Zealand; but it was the final Test of the 1935 series in England which proclaimed him as truly a Test cricketer. Going in at No. 8, he hit 117 in 140 minutes, and added a record 137 in 70 minutes for the ninth wicket with 'Chud' Langton after early discomfort against Walter Robins' leg-spin. The stand helped shut England out, and South Africa sailed away with their first victory against England secure, having won at Lord's (when Dalton, a change bowler, dismissed Hammond and Wyatt)."", ""He made 1446 runs at 37 on that 1935 tour, with 117 against Essex before the Oval Test as his other century, and he finished next to Bruce Mitchell in the Test averages. When England returned a visit three years later, Dalton made 102 in the opening Test, the last Springbok century at the old Wanderers ground, Johannesburg. He achieved nothing else of note until the final Test at Durban, his birthplace, when the 10-day 'timeless Test' produced 1981 runs, 57 of them from Dalton's bat in the first innings. Curiously, he had Hammond stumped in both innings, taking his dismissals of the great Englishman to four out of his total of 12 Test wickets."", 'Eric Dalton had a modest tour of Australia in 1931-32, having cause to remember in particular the Queensland match, when he bagged a pair, and the lovely island of Tasmania, where he scored his only century of the tour in the first match and then, going in on a hat-trick, had his jaw broken in two places by an ugly delivery from Laurie Nash. He did, though, have a long stand with Herby Taylor at Sydney, where he scored 87 against NSW. The injury compelled him to have his jaw wired up for a month, a pair of pliers handy at all times in case of emergency.', 'Dalton, who played for Natal, was also an accomplished soccer player, golfer (South African amateur champion 1950), lawn tennis and table tennis player, and bowls exponent. His first-class cricket career extended from 1924 to 1947, in which time he made 5333 runs at 33.12, with 13 centuries, the highest 157.

In all matches during that tour he scored 2,080 runs, taking sixty wickets, and in the Test match at  Melbourne he hit a splendid 204. For the team of 1912 he made 1,075 runs and obtained 163 wickets. Although at the beginning of his career, particularly at the time when he first became prominent in South African Inter-State cricket in 1906, he was of little value as a batsman, he became as the years passed, almost as great a batsman as he was a bowler. His style rather conveyed the impression of awkwardness and he could not, at any time, be described as a free, forcible bat. Nevertheless, very few men made runs with more assurance than Faulkner, and he was a most difficult batsman to get out. After settling down in England he had a great season in club cricket in  Nottinghamshire, making twelve hundreds in scoring 2,868 runs with an average of 84.35, besides taking 218 wickets, including all ten in an innings on two occasions. Still, his finest innings in this country was at Eastbourne in  1921 when by a wonderful 153 against the Australians -- up to that point an unbeaten side -- he virtually gave victory to A. C. MacLaren's XI. Faulkner was also a first-rate field."", 'When the time came for him to retire from the game, he gained much distinction as acoach. He followed a theory entirely his own when he established the first cricket school known in London and at the time of his death the school had earned world-wide fame. Faulkner devoted the greater part of his time to the school, though he found opportunity to write many articles on the game. During the European War he served with distinction with the R.F.A. in Salonika, Egypt and Palestine, gaining the D.S.O. in 1918 and the Order of the Nile.']",[],25.0,47.0,4.0,1754.0,204,40.79,,,4.0,8.0,,3.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,118.0,197,23,6366,204,36.58,,,13,32,,,94.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25.0,43,4227,2180,82.0,7/84,9/75,26.58,3.09,51.5,4,4,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,118.0,,16624,7826,449,7/26,,17.42,2.82,37.0,,33,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He played in 14 Test matches, spread over almost seven years, 12 of which were in tandem with Adcock. Peter Pollock, who later formed a similarly feared new-ball partnership with Mike Procter, said: ""Adcock was quicker but Heine put the heat into the combination."" Adcock said that he and Heine were good friends. ""We would have a few drinks together in the evenings and work out which one of us would knock over which batsman. He was very aggressive on the field, with a big heart, but meek and mild off it."" Stories of his aggression were numerous. After felling Peter Richardson, the England opener, during the 1956-57 series, he allegedly said: ""Get up, I want to hit you again."" Heine only started playing cricket at the age of 19 when, working as a fireman in Pietermaritzburg, he was pressed into playing for the fire department. ""You are big and strong so you can open the bowling,"" he was told. He was also a hard-hitting lower-order batsman who hit a straight six off Hugh Tayfield which was reported to have carried a world record 180 yards in a match between Orange Free State and Natal in Bloemfontein in 1954-55. It was a massive hit, although subsequent research reduced the estimated distance by between 20 and 30 yards. He made his debut in the second Test at Lord\'s in 1955, taking 5 for 60 in the first innings. His victims were Graveney, May, Compton, Barrington and Evans. Another five-wicket haul followed at Old Trafford, where he and Adcock shared 14 wickets in a South African win. When England toured South Africa in 1956-57, arguably Heine\'s most telling contribution to a shared series was made before the Test matches when Transvaal played the tourists at the new Wanderers Stadium at Johannesburg. He dismissed Peter May for a first-ball duck after May had started the tour with four successive centuries. John Waite, the Transvaal and South African wicketkeeper, had noted that English batsmen tended to play according to the angle of delivery. Heine bowled from wide and May, assuming the ball would be angled in, edged an out-swinger to Waite.

Since then he's undergone a blond rinse and sorted out his run-up, but the attitude remains. He still wants to bowl fast and sees no point whatsoever in making friends with batsmen. In the long term, Hayward is clearly seen as the successor to Allan Donald as the spearhead of the South African attack. He has genuine pace, the ability to get bounce and abundant energy. When all these are properly harnessed, he can be a fearsome opponent. He toured England with South Africa in 1998, but it was a largely unhappy trip for the fast bowler. He never quite came to terms with English wickets and lost his rhythm and run-up midway through the tour. Question marks surfaced over his willingness to heed advice and for a while it seemed possible that his undoubted potential might go unrealised. However, he started taking wickets left, right and centre and forced his way into the team for the second Test against England. It was an auspicious debut. He took 4 for 75 in conditions, which suited the batsmen and impressed with his willingness to keep running in under a hot sun. However, after 14 Tests, the last of which was against Pakistan in January 2003, it was revealed that he had signed a deal with Worcestershire which precluded him from being released for international matches. At the time, he said he agreed to the contract because he had not been consistently selected in the national squad, and had therefore given up hope of future selection. But after a rethink, he declared himself available again in June 2004, and was immediately picked for the tour of Sri Lanka later that year. He only managed four wickets in two Tests during that tour and faded out of national reckoning. In April 2007 Hayward signed on as one of Ireland's overseas players for the Friends Provident Trophy, and also played for the Kolkata Tigers in the Indian Cricket League at the end of the year.

A haul of 49 wickets in the 2005/06 SuperSport Series, which no bowler bettered, put him in the frame for a call up to the Test side.

He first appeared for South Africa against Capt. R. T. Stanyforth's MCC side in 1927-28, when he played in all five Tests, but, though he made some useful scores, he met with no particular success and his bowling was hardly used. It was on the tour of England in 1929 that he showed his real possibilities. In first-class matches he scored 1,443 runs with an average of 34.35 and took 69 wickets at 26.01. In the Tests he came second both in batting and bowling: at Lord's he made 88 and 17 not out and took seven wickets, at Old Trafford he scored 63 out of a total of 130 and at The Oval 81. Tall and well built he bowled fast medium away-swingers with an easy action and plenty of pace off the pitch, and was probably the best bowler in the team. A fine driver on the both sides of the wicket, he was inclined to be impetuous but had, as he showed at Lord's, a solid defence when required. He was also a good slip. A great future seemed in store for him and that winter he helped S. S. L. Steyn to put on 222 for the eighth wicket for Western Province v Border, still a South African record. But he had already decided to settle in England and so was not available to play against the MCC side in 1930-31. However he was a member in 1931-32 of the South African team to Australia, where he was a sad disappointment. As a batsman he could never get going in the Tests and his bowling was a complete failure. Only in the last match against Western Australia, not then the power they have since become, did he show his best form, scoring 150 not out and taking eight for 13 in the second innings. In extenuation it must be said that he was in poor health at the beginning of the tour and that he also had trouble with his bowling action. This was the end of his Test career. In 1932 Sir Julien Cahn helped him to establish a business in the motor trade in Nottingham, which became a flourishing concern. For Sir Julien between 1932 and 1939 he made nearly 10,000 runs and took over 400 wickets. During the War he served in the Army. His brother, Ray, also played for Western Province and at one time showed promise of being the better bowler of the two.\n"", ' \n', 'The death of Denys Paul Beck Morkel only two months after that of Jack Cheetham\nsees the passing of a second great Western Province cricket product. Morkel, who\ndied on October 6, played relatively little Currie Cup cricket, though he averaged 46.96 in his 30 innings and took 46 wickets with his fast bowling at an average of 26.65. His first century came in 1928-29, against Orange Free State, and in the following season, as captain of WP, he hit 208 not out against Natal. This was the season in which he (114) and left-hander S. S. L. Steyn (261\nnot out) put on 222 for the eighth wicket against Border at Cape Town, still a South African record.', ""The first of his 16 Test appearances came against England in the 1927-28 series,\nwhen after taking Holmes's wicket in his first over, he hardly distinguished himself in any of the five matches. But in England in 1929 the tall, handsome Springbok emerged as the best allrounder, enjoying Lord's with innings of 88 in the Test and 70 against MCC, and taking 7 for 61 against Middlesex. Seven of his 14 wickets in the series came at Lord's, where he plucked out Killick, Hammond and O'Connor in a fiery opening spell. In fact all 14 of his wickets were prestigious, Hammond, Sutcliffe, Duleep, Hendren several times among them."", ""On the tour he made 1443 runs at 34.35 and took 69 wickets at 26.01. His sole hundred came against Yorkshire at Hull, and he made 63 (all but half the innings total) and 36 in the innings defeat at Old Trafford (Tich Freeman 12 wickets), and 81 at The Oval in the final Test. But the most fateful performance was 7 for 61 against millionaire Sir Julien Cahn's XI at West Bridgford near the end of the tour. Cahn invited him to play for his team, which toured out-of-the-way territories, and set him up in the motor trade in the Nottingham area. Morkel hit 251 in better than even time against the South American touring team in\n1932."", ""He was to play six more times for his country, touring Australasia in 1931-32 as\nSouth Africa's vice-captain; but he made only 98 runs in 10 Test innings, and did little bowling.

He led the Test batting figures with 488 runs at 69.71, making centuries at Lord's and the Oval. Against Surrey at the Oval he made 195 (his career-highest) and put on 330 for the first wicket with Eric Rowan in the biggest partnership by a South African pair in England. Had he not missed eight out of nine matches at the start of the tour through injury, he could well have scored over 2000 runs."", ""Mitchell played the innings of his life in the Lord's Test, making 164 not out in the South African second innings and setting up the Springboks' First Test win in England. On a pitch favouring spinners, Mitchell batted with calm assurance against the strong England attack, being aided by `Chud' Langton in a then-record seventh-wicket stand of 101 for South Africa in Tests in England.

He topped the averages for first-class matches with 2014 runs at 61.03, made eight centuries and finished second in the Test figures with 597 runs at 66.33. His aggregate is the highest by a South African on tour. His first eight innings produced only 110 runs, but he then played a superb innings of 103 not out, carrying his bat against MCC at Lord's when none of his team-mates managed to exceed 40 in the match. Three centuries in five innings were followed by failure in the First Test, but he was South Africa's leading runmaker in the second with 46 and 80. He was run out in the Third Test when 80 and looking set for a century, and in the final Test, at the Oval, he became the second Springbok to score two centuries in a Test. Mitchell spent all but eight minutes of the four days on the field, batting for more than 13 hours in scoring 120 and 189 not out - efforts which almost brought victory to his side. As it was, when the game ended, South Africa, chasing 451, had reached 423 for 7, and Mitchell and Lindsay Tuckett (40 not out) had added 109 for the eighth wicket, the best in a Test for the Springboks against England."", ""Mitchell played in only three matches in 1947-48, the last in his Currie Cup career, but he was in fine form when MCC toured the following summer. He did as well as most in the low-scoring First Test, top-scored with 86 in the first innings of the second, and made 120 at Newlands in the third match of the series to equal Herby Taylor's record of seven Test centuries against England- a number later achieved by Dudley Nourse also. Mitchell made 99 and 56 in the fifth Test, at Port Elizabeth, and few would have guessed that he would never again play for South Africa."", 'Although he had turned 40 when the Australians arrived the following season, he was considered a certainty for the series along with two other veterans, Dudley Nourse and Eric Rowan, especially after his 475 runs at 52.77 against England the previous summer. However, after the Australian fast bowlers had launched an all-out attack on him in the Transvaal and South African XI matches, the selectors caused a sensation by omitting him from the First Test. In spite of managing only 29 runs in three innings, he had stood up to Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and the others unflinchingly, and certainly deserved a chance in at least two Tests to find his form - especially as he had played in 42 consecutive Tests. Taking everything into account, his omission must rate as the shabbiest treatment handed out to a Springbok by selectors.', 'Bruce Mitchell played no more first-class cricket, finishing his distinguished career with 11,395 runs at 45.39 from 173 matches. He hit 30 centuries, held 228 catches, and captured 249 wickets at 25.63. He was a superb slip fielder, and his total of 56 catches in his 42 Tests is the most by a South African other than a wicketkeeper. He caught 12 in the 1930-31 series against England, including five in the fourth Test, and held six in the Third Test at Melbourne in 1931-32. All these feats are the best for South Africa, and Mitchell shares them with several other players.', ""Few quieter or more modest men have played Test cricket, and Mitchell's perfect sportsmanship on and off the field at all times was living proof that success can be achieved without any compromise of behaviour.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1936'],42.0,80.0,9.0,3471.0,189*,48.88,,,8.0,21.0,,1.0,56.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,173.0,281,30,11395,195,45.39,,,30,55,,,228.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.0,39,2525,1380,27.0,5/87,5/87,51.11,3.27,93.5,1,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,173.0,,12360,6382,249,6/33,,25.63,3.09,49.6,,15,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Those who were lucky enough to see it still remember after 50 years his innings of 114 in two and a half hours for Sussex against the West Indians at Hove in 1933. It was the summer after the body-line tour and the fast bowlers, Griffith and Martindale, assailed him with vicious bouncers. They might have been serving up by request something to amuse him and the spectators. They were mercilessly hooked and, if they pitched the ball up, they were driven. Even granted the placid Hove wicket, it was a remarkable display. Years afterwards, meeting him at Lord's at a time when short-pitched fast bowling was being constantly discussed, I asked him if he had ever ducked to it. He smiled sweetly and said, I don't think so. I think either I hit them or they hit me! From what I saw of him I doubt if he was ever hit by anything that rose high enough to be hooked. \n"", 'Standing six feet two inches and slightly built, he was a wonderful timer of the ball; his methods were a model for the young cricketer and reduced every risk to a minimum. The drive, the hook and the cut all seemed to come equally easily to him and he was, besides, a good player off his legs. Moreover he was a fine field anywhere and in his younger days a serviceable change bowler, first with leg-breaks and later with off-breaks and swingers.', ""Picked for Natal at seventeen, while still a boy at Michaelhouse, he scored a century next season in a trial to select the 1929 side to England and his father was asked whether he would allow him to go. But he was anxious to follow his elder brother, Colin (also a stylish batsman who had a trial for the University), to Trinity, Oxford, and it was thought wiser to refuse. In the Freshmen's Match in 1930 he made 132 not out and took eight for 72. Naturally he was picked for the first match, against Kent, in which he scored 78 and put on 148 with N. M. Ford for the fourth wicket before being run out. In the next match he made 118 against Yorkshire. These innings were the more remarkable as he had had little experience of playing on grass. Unfortunately in the' Varsity match he was hampered by a knee so weak that it was only a few minutes before the start that it was decided to play him and he did nothing. In 1931 D. N. Moore fell ill and Melville was appointed captain in his place. In 1932 he was captain in his own right, but missed much of the season owing to a collar-bone broken by a collision while batting. In 1933, when he played a fourth time, he had to stand out of many matches in order to work. Although his cricket for Oxford during these years left no-one in any doubt about his class, he was, like some other notable'Varsity bats, a disappointment in the match at Lord's: his highest score was 47 and his six innings produced an average of 16 only. As Oxford had Peebles in 1930 and Owen-Smith for the next three years, comparatively little use was made of his leg-breaks, but in 1932 he did the hat-trick against Leveson Gower's XI at Eastbourne and headed the averages."", 'He had been playing for Sussex since 1932 and continued to do so with great success until 1936, captaining them in 1934 and 1935. In 1935 and 1936 he headed their batting averages and in 1935 the bowling averages too, though he took only twelve wickets. It will not surprise the friends of so charming and modest a man that he was criticised for not bowling himself more. In 1935, though suffering from a very sore thumb, he made 101 in 90 minutes against Larwood, then admittedly past his best, and Voce at Hove, and his last innings for the county, against All India in September 1936, was the highest he ever played for them, 152, including a hundred before lunch on the second morning.', 'Returning home at the end of that season and joining a firm of stockbrokers in Johannesburg, he became captain of the Transvaal side and then captained South Africa in 1938-39 against England. He did little himself in the first two Tests, but in the third promoted himself to open and shared in stands of 108 and 131 for the first wicket, and in the notorious timeless Test which concluded the tour scored 78 and 103, though he was handicapped throughout these three matches by a bad leg which finally forced him to move himself down the order.', ""Not physically very strong, he had never fully recovered from a back injury sustained in a car smash before he went up to Oxford, and a fall while training with the South African forces in the war caused a recurrence of the trouble. For nearly a year he was in a steel jacket and it was feared that his career was at an end. Luckily the fears proved false and by 1947, after various vicissitudes, he was fit to undertake the captaincy of the South African side in England. The earlier part of the tour was a personal triumph for him, culminating in innings of 189 and 104 not out in the first Test at Nottingham, followed by 117 in the first innings of the Lord's Test. He thus became the first batsman to score four consecutive hundreds against England in Tests. Moreover at Nottingham his stand of 319 with Nourse, made in exactly four hours, was at the time the highest for the third wicket in any Test. After this and in view of his inspiring captaincy, it was disappointing that his side should lose three of the Tests and draw two. He himself was, not surprisingly, completely worn out by the end of June: he had lost a lot of weight and the food rationing still in force did not help him. After a brave 59 in the second innings of the third Test, he accomplished, by the high standards he had set himself, comparatively little, though an innings of 114 not out against his own county at Hove must have given him much pleasure. At the end of the tour he announced his retirement from first-class cricket. However, in the autumn of 1948 he was persuaded to reappear and an innings of 92 for Transvaal against F. G. Mann's MCC side brought him an invitation to play in the first Test. This he had to refuse owing to an injured wrist, but played in the third Test, in which he ended his international career with two useful innings. Later he was for many years a South African selector.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1948'],11.0,19.0,2.0,894.0,189,52.58,,,4.0,3.0,,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,190.0,295,15,10598,189,37.85,,,25,53,,,156,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,190.0,,6927,3959,132,5/17,,29.99,3.42,52.4,,7,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He spent a couple of years bowling just\ntwo lengths before a serious ankle injury in 1998 forced him to drop his\npace and develop further skills. He was a revelation in his debut Test, ending with match-winning figures of 8 for 64 against India in Calcutta. He showed glimpses of his big-hitting in the years leading to the 1999 World Cup. His baseball-style backlift and thunderous hitting symbolised the tournament and his heroics nearly took South Africa to the final.  \n"", 'Around 2000 he began fulfilling the role of second spinner, bowling medium-pace cutters off just six paces that many batsmen find impossible to score from.

But as his run of poor form became\nprolonged he lost his place in the side, and a recall for the 2003 World\nCup failed to kick-start his career. His subsequent omission for the 2003\ntour of England put his international career in doubt, and led to a bout of legal wrangling. However, after both parties settled their differences, he was recalled for the one-day series against West Indies in 2003-04, kept his place for the following series in New Zealand, and earned a Test recall to the tour of Sri Lanka in 2004. However, it was a short-lived comeback and he left international cricket for good to join the African influx at Northants under Kepler Wessels.

Then, all those virtues brought him rich rewards after his playing days too, as he became one of the most successful and popular coaches of India. The side went to the top of the Test rankings during his stint, which ended, quite fittingly, with India's World Cup triumph in 2011. \n"", 'As a batsman, what stood out was his determination, the ability to concentrate for long periods and a burning desire to score runs. A left-hander with a relatively unique technique, Kirsten simply worked out his strengths and weaknesses and based his game around them. In this respect he was one of the most organised batsman to play for South Africa since their readmission. Calm and level-headed, he brought a healthy degree of common sense to the art of batting, which possibly explains why off the field and in the dressing room the dafter side of his personality came out. Periodically, Kirsten endured patches when he persistently got out in similar fashion - chopping the ball on to his stumps, for instance, or getting himself caught down the leg side. ', 'Each time this happened, though, Kirsten worked through the problem, made the adjustments and played himself back into form. He enjoyed particular success on the subcontinent - where other players have floundered against the turning ball. Kirsten, though, was drawn on patience and soft hands to see him through. And if there was any player likely to score a big hundred, then it was Kirsten. His best of 275, a result of batting for over 14 and a half hours as South Africa followed on against England at Kingsmead in 1999-00, was the second-longest in Test history. He then returned to haunt England in 2003 and gutsed out a crucial 130 in the Headingley Test, which South Africa won by 191 runs. His good form in that series persuaded him to postpone his retirement until the end of the New Zealand tour in 2003-04. ', ""Fittingly, he scored a century in the first Test of that series - his 99th - and scored a typically gritty 76 in his final game to help South Africa tie the series. After retiring, he spent some time with the Warriors as a consultant batting coach and, in 2006, set up his own academy in Cape Town. In December 2007, he signed up as coach of India, and his quiet and low-profile approach to the job was appreciated by current and past players. After coaching India to No. 1 in Test cricket and World Cup success in 2011, Kirsten moved on to see if he could repeat the magic with his home country. While the global title didn't come, he did firmly establish South Africa as the No. 1 team in Tests. The highlights of his time with them were away series wins against England and then Australia in the latter half of 2012, results which helped South Africa to the top of the rankings.

His value was fourfold: he bowled legbreaks and googlies with skill and stamina; batted well in the middle order; had safe hands at slip or short leg; and when conditions suited, he also bowled seamers. \n', ""Born in Shropshire on March 16, 1920, Percy Neville Frank Mansell made his first-class debut as a 16-year-old schoolboy in 1936-37. Two years later he made 62 against Hammond's visiting MCC team at Bulawayo. The war took vital years, but upon resumption of cricket he soon made his mark, scoring a maiden hundred (against Transvaal) in 1946-47. His bowling took longer to mature, but in 1949-50 he took 6 for 89 against the touring Australians, and a year later, with a South African tour of England in the offing, he performed well with bat and ball, principally in the match against NE Transvaal, when he had match figures of 10 for 167."", ""Never of robust build, quiet and with scholarly spectacles, Mansell just missed the distinction of a century in his maiden Test when chosen for the Headingley match in July 1951, the fourth of the series. In a Test remembered for Peter May's debut hundred after Eric Rowan had ground out 236 towards South Africa's highest score against England- 538 - Percy Mansell worked his way to 90, but with No. 11 Cuan McCarthy now in, he had to take risks, and a lofted hit off Malcolm Hilton was held by the tall Roy Tattersall at mid-on. Not until 1992, over 40 years later, did a South Africa batsman ( Andrew Hudson, at Bridgetown) finally score a century on Test debut."", ""It was Mansell's highest score of the tour and of his eventual 13 Tests. His best tour return with the ball was 5 for 37 (9 for 110 in the match) against Glamorgan at Swansea, but his gladdest moment would have come (in the MCC match) from bowling Freddie Brown with his first ball at Lord's."", 'Back home, Mansell became only the second allrounder after Vogler to do the 500 runs/50 wickets double, which included a 100 runs/10 wickets match double against NE Transvaal at Pretoria. His 13 for 205 against Border at East London was then the best analysis for Rhodesia.', 'In the 1952-53 Tests in Australia, he took only nine wickets, but eight were top batsmen ( Colin McDonald and Lindsay Hassett each three times), and his 52 in the fifth Test greatly helped the cause as South Africa fought their way to victory in a high-scoring Test, levelling an enthralling series.', ""A good'54-55 season, with two Currie Cup centuries, earned him another trip to England, but he did very little in his four Tests in that gripping series, apart from holding nine catches, several of high calibre. Although he hit 154 against Durham, he again failed to make a first-class century, missing by one run against Essex at Colchester when Trevor Bailey bowled him."", 'For Rhodesia, Mansell continued to return major contributions: a career-highest 154 against Griqualand West, and 148 in the return match; 11 for 84 against Border; then career-best match and innings figures of 6 for 7 and 7 for 43 (and innings of 66 and 19) as Rhodesia beat Surrey by two runs at Salisbury (now Harare) in his final full season, 1959-60. But there was no Test place for him against the 1956-57 England or 1957-58 Australian sides.', 'Retiring after one match in 1961-62, Mansell made altogether 4598 runs (29.66) and took 299 wickets (26.08) in his 113 matches, and held 156 catches.', 'Taken to Rhodesia when only a few months old, he was a tennis champion as a teenager. A lifelong bachelor, he moved to Cape Province in 1985, and played much golf. A ball hit his forearm and broke it in 1994, and his health deteriorated.

The untimely death of this modest and likeable man, known throughout the cricket world as Tufty, was yet another grievous blow to a country which has lost so many fine cricketers in their playing prime. Taken ill soon after the Fourth Test in England in 1951, he underwent an abdominal operation and stayed in England for three months before flying home. He bore his troubles with the steadfastness and patience which characterised him in all things, but another operation became necessary midway through 1952 and he died some six weeks later. \n', ""Born at Brakpan, Transvaal, on December 28, 1921, Mann was first educated at Michaelhouse College. He represented Natal Schools at cricket, and at the age of 16, won the Natal Amateur Golf Championship. Subsequently he went to Cambridge. Although bowling well in the Freshmen's match there in 1939 he did not gain a place in any of the University games, but, turning his attention again to golf, he won his Blue. Going back to South Africa, he played for Natal in the 1939-40 season. His first experience of big cricket could have been anything but encouraging, for Mann was a member of the Natal attack against which Transvaal scored 608 runs for six wickets. E. A. Rowan's 306 not out still remains a South African batting record. With two wickets for 106 in 45 overs, Mann did not suffer so much from Rowan's flogging as did his colleagues."", 'During the war Mann was captured in Italy, but he escaped and was hidden by peasants. On his return to South Africa he settled in Port Elizabeth and began his association with Eastern Province. He quickly made his mark by impeccable length, direction and control of spin, and in December 1946, against Transvaal at Johannesburg, he established a then world record by bowling 542 balls (67.6-38-69-6) in an innings.', 'The Selectors merely confirmed the opinion of all South African cricketers when they chose him as the left-arm slow bowler to made the tour to England in 1947.', 'In a high-scoring series of Tests, Mann headed the South African bowling averages with 15 wickets, average 40.20. Making his international debut on a typically docile pitch at Nottingham, Mann conformed so successfully to the tactics required by his captain that he opened with eight successive maiden overs against such punishing batsmen as Denis Compton and Edrich--in their peak year--and in the match sent down 80 overs for 104 runs. More accurate bowling on an unhelpful pitch scarcely could be imagined. Another good performance was his four for 68 in 50 overs in the Fourth Test. Throughout the tour he completely fulfilled the two main functions of a left-arm slow bowler--to seal up one end when conditions favoured batsmen and to extract full advantage when they offered him the slightest assistance. Although indifferent eyesight compelled Mann to wear glasses and also handicapped his batting, he occasionally delighted spectators with powerful hitting made with a free swing of the bat. That season he trounced the Glamorgan bowling for 97 out of 122 in a stand with A. M. B. Rowan lasting fifty-five minutes. He fell to a catch in the deep when trying a big hit which would have completed his only century in first-class cricket.', ""From the time of his entry into Test cricket, Mann became an automatic choice for South Africa and, until illness forced him to withdraw from the Fifth Test at The Oval in 1951, he played in nineteen consecutive Tests, fourteen against England, five against Australia. Earlier in that 1951 season Mann's four for 24 in the second innings at Nottingham helped South Africa to gain their first Test victory for sixteen years and the second in all visits to England."", ""Few better illustrations of Mann's accuracy could be provided than the fact that, on seven occasions when he bowled fifty or more overs in Test cricket, only once did he give away more than 100 runs. Two of his best feats were eight for 59 against Western Province at Capetown in 1947-48 and six for 59 against F. G. Mann's M.C.C. Team in the Durban Test of 1948-49. His record in Currie Cup games bore comparison with any bowler of his type in the Union. In the twelve games in which he participated he took 75 wickets, including twelve for 102 against Rhodesia in 1950-51.\n""]",[],19.0,31.0,1.0,400.0,52,13.33,,,0.0,1.0,,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,73.0,99,16,1446,97,17.42,,,0,3,,,25,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19.0,33,5796,1920,58.0,6/59,7/72,33.1,1.98,99.9,5,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,73.0,,20373,5952,251,8/59,,23.71,1.75,81.1,,14,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Jacques Kallis is the broad-shouldered colossus of the South African team, a figure whose looming presence inspires calm in some and dread in others.\n \nFew players who belong to the modern age are a better fit for the notion of the classical cricketer. Kallis is a fine, forceful batsman who has at his disposal both a rock-solid technique and a mind impervious to distraction. Though his role as a bowler diminishes with each passing season, he will be remembered as a purveyor of sometimes surprising pace and swing, and awkward bounce. In the slips, his sure-handedness and rattlesnake reflexes make ridiculous catches look regulation. \n', 'Kallis announced himself as a batsman of international stature in his seventh Test, the drawn Boxing Day epic at Melbourne in 1997, when he scored a fighting 101 on a worn last-day pitch. Not even Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne could dislodge him before he had all but saved the match for South Africa.', 'Over the years Kallis has delivered many such innings, performances in which grit is a far more valuable commodity than glitz to a South African team that remains more confident in the field and with its fast bowlers in full cry than as a batting unit. Kallis has willingly shouldered the role of the fulcrum around which the wheel must try to turn. But, occasionally, he has unfurled a stroke of startling aggression that hints at what might have been.', 'Certainly, his lofted drive, which begins with a menacing backlift before uncoiling into the irresistible momentum of a mighty downward swoop of the bat and finishing in a twirl of Baroque, might be described as Mozart in motion. In the lightning flash of that fleeting instant it really does seem as if Kallis could, in the words of one observer, hit a six whenever he felt like it.', ""His critics, particularly those who have a limited understanding of the dynamics of the South African team, accuse him of not dominating attacks he has already ground into the dust, of unnecessarily slow scoring, and of failing to take the match situation into account as he plots his innings. All of which hints at selfishness, which is quite ironical, because his team-mates vouch for the fact that Kallis bats the way he does precisely because he puts his team first and his personal ambitions some way behind. It's the only way he knows how."", ' ']","['ICC Test Player of the Year 2005', 'ICC Player of the Year 2005']",166.0,280.0,40.0,13289.0,224,55.37,28903.0,45.97,45.0,58.0,1488.0,97.0,200.0,0.0,328.0,314,53,11579.0,139,44.36,15885,72.89,17,86,911,137,131.0,0.0,25.0,23,4,666.0,73,35.05,558,119.35,0,5,56,20,7.0,0.0,257.0,421,57,19695,224,54.10,,,62,97,,,264,0,424.0,406,65,14845,155*,43.53,,,23,109,,,162.0,0.0,176.0,171,28,4416,97*,30.88,3927,112.45,0,32,437,100,54.0,0.0,166.0,272,20232,9535,292.0,6/54,9/92,32.65,2.82,69.2,7,5,0,328.0,283,10750,8680,273.0,5/30,5/30,31.79,4.84,39.3,2,2,0,25.0,19,276,333,12.0,4/15,4/15,27.75,7.23,23.0,1,0,0,257.0,,29033,13532,427,6/54,,31.69,2.79,67.9,,8,0,424.0,,13673,10772,351,5/30,5/30,30.68,4.72,38.9,3,3,0,176.0,150,2747,3482,114,4/15,4/15,30.54,7.60,24.0,2,0,0,True,True,False,True

He turned to spin on a whim in the nets one afternoon at school. He found that it worked and stuck to it. Maharaj's secret was his accuracy. At the Dolphins, he was able to combine that with an ability to take wickets at key moments."", ""During the opening first-class match of the 2016-17 season, Maharaj picked up 13 for 157, and was then told he would be on South Africa's Test tour to Australia. Maharaj debuted at the WACA, an unusual place for a spinner, given the conditions, but did a remarkable job. In an innings in which he had to hold one end when Dale Steyn was injured, Maharaj bowled well enough to allow the other two seamers to be rotated at the other side.

Five times he scored over 1,000 runs and five times dismissed more than 100 batsmen in a season, achieving the double in 1901 and repeating the performance in all matches in 1908 and 1910. \n', ""He created a stir in his first match before he had qualified for Championship games by hitting 72 and 21 against the 1899 Australian touring side and taking 8 for 132 in the first innings on a true pitch. That performance gained him a place in Ranjitsinhji's team who toured America the following winter. One of his best all-round feats was against Somerset at Taunton in 1901 when he played an innings of 153 in one hundred minutes and took 10 for 183 runs. Against the South Africans at Southampton the same season he reached the highest of his 15 centuries, 216, put together in three hours and including 30 boundaries, and followed by sending back six batsmen for 105 runs and holding three catches. Twice he registered two centuries in a match: 102 and 100 against Derbyshire at Derby in 1905 and 130 and 101 not out against Sussex at Hove in 1909. His second innings at Hove occupied only an hour."", 'A bowler skilled in variation of pace and spin, he gained his best match-analysis at Southampton in 1901, dismissing 14 Worcestershire batsmen for 171 runs.', ""A disagreement over terms resulted in him severing his connection with Hampshire, but after touring Australia with PW Sherwell's South African team in 1910-11, he returned to England and played in League cricket."", 'Incidentally, he might once have assisted England, for he was among the fourteen players from whom the team who met Australia in the first Test at Edgbaston in 1902 was selected.\n', ""\nAfter he left Hampshire at the end of 1910 he continued playing high-standard league cricket until he was 62.  In 1913 while still with Accrington he scored 188 not out against Bacup, which remained the highest score in the Lancashire League until beaten by Learie Constantine's 192 not out for Nelson v East Lancashire in 1939. He later played in the Bradford League for Undercliffe and even at the age of 55 he topped the bowling averages, in addition to being the only man to take 100 wickets in the Bolton League.""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1911'],15.0,28.0,1.0,544.0,90,20.14,,,0.0,4.0,,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,267.0,461,34,11425,216,26.75,,,18,,,,175,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,21,2292,1421,48.0,6/92,10/116,29.6,3.71,47.7,2,4,1,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,267.0,,45372,23715,1013,9/55,,23.41,3.13,44.7,,82,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He is best remembered for his dominant role in the victorious 1966-67 home series against Bobby Simpson's Australians in which he scored 606 runs in seven innings at an average of 86.57. He also took a then South African record 24 catches. "", 'His cavalier feats in a maiden 3-1 series win over Australia are indelibly writ in the folklore of South African cricket; the audacious manner in which he turned potential disaster into triumph with a carefree disregard for the batting wreckage that lay around him was the difference between the sides.', 'The extent of his influence is well illustrated. In the first Test at Johannesburg he came to the crease on 41 for 5 after South Africa had elected to bat. They won by 233 runs, his contributions 69 and 182, a record score by a South African wicketkeeper.', ""In the third Test at Durban South Africa were put into bat on a well-grassed pitch; this time they slumped to 94 for 6 but Lindsay's 137 hauled them back and they won by eight wickets. That century, in difficult conditions, was probably the most valuable of his three in the series. In it, for once, he did not attempt to hit sixes."", ""Lindsay's childhood friend was the allrounder Herbert `Tiger' Lance. During the 1960s they were regular team-mates in the Test team, an irrepressible and inseparable duo. Tall, strong men, they always stood side by side in the team photographs and batted consecutively in the middle order, sharing two century partnerships in the 1966-67 series. They even ran to the same end in the second innings at Newlands when their 119-run stand ended with Lance the victim of the run-out."", 'In the field Lance, at second slip, was also close enough to his pal to offer highly original words of wisdom. Indeed, as a devoted student of the game Lindsay found the perfect foil in the rough-hewn Lance. Long after their playing days they would watch together at the Wanderers or Centurion. ', 'On one occasion they were discussing the inability of a Test batsman to find the gaps in the field. ""He has to go through the air,"" argued Lance. ""No, the risk\'s too great; he has to keep it on the grass,"" retorted Lindsay. The argument persisted, ""through the air"" or ""on the grass"", until Lindsay turned to Lance and asked, ""Why are you so adamant he should go airborne?"" ""Easy, my mate,"" replied Lance, ""there\'s more air than grass.""', ""This simple truth would not have been lost on Lindsay. In the summer of 1966-67 he regularly elected to hit through the air with hooks and lofted drives in his astonishing assault on Australia's bowlers. He hit 12 sixes in the five-match series, nine of them coming at the Wanderers, when he scored magnificent centuries in the two Tests played on that ground."", ""In attempting to hook a bouncer from the tall fast bowler David Renneberg in the second Test at Newlands he miscued for once and the ball thundered off the edge on to his unprotected forehead. As Lindsay fell unconscious on the pitch, blood starting from a nasty wound, the ball rebounded into Renneberg's hands for a simple return catch and Lindsay was out for 5."", 'In the second innings he returned bravely, his forehead stitched, to hook three sixes in his 81. In the days before helmets he never batted in a cap. In the fourth Test at the Wanderers he came in at 3.25pm. His century came 110 minutes later. An appeal against the light, with Lindsay on 95, was turned down by the umpires. He hit the next ball from Bob Cowper into the distant grandstand. He went on to score 131.', 'Lindsay made his Test debut in Australia in 1963-64 and was a member of the team that won the series in England in 1965. In his 19 Tests he scored 1,130 runs (ave 37.66) and made 59 dismissals. He believed fervently in the spirit of the game and served in his latter years as an ICC match referee.', ""Lindsay played his provincial cricket for North-Eastern Transvaal, one of South Africa's lesser teams. He enjoyed playing against neighbouring Transvaal (Lance's team) at the Wanderers where, shortly before the arrival of Simpson's Australians in October 1966, he hit a career-best 216.

He was called up for the 1963-64 tour of Australia and New Zealand as understudy to John Waite and he played three Tests on the tour, and another three Tests against England the following  season before making way for Waite in the last two Tests of the series. In 1965 he was first choice for the England tour, but his zenith came against Australia in 1966-67 when he hammered three centuries in scoring 606 runs at 86.57 in the series (a record for a wicketkeeper) as well as taking 24 catches. His 182 at the Wanderers in the first Test (', ' wrote ""he let loose a flood of thrilling strokes without ever seeming to use other than the middle of the bat"") was instrumental in helping South Africa gain their first series win over Australia.

Jackie McGlew became synonymous with South African cricket in the 1950s. His batting fitted his name: he was a sticker, and concentration, discipline, commitment and athleticism were the abiding virtues of his own game, and that of his team. He became famous - or notorious - for some of Test cricket's slowest innings. He batted nine hours 35 minutes for 105 against  Australia at  Durban in  1957-58; his 545-minute century remained the slowest in first-class cricket for 20 years.  Although as a feat of endurance and concentration it was remarkable, said Wisden,  it is doubtful whether  South Africa benefited by it. They led by 221 on  first innings but could not bowl  Australia out. McGlew grew up in Natal, and was pictured waving a bat as a four-year-old. He went on to captain the province's schoolboys, and made his debut for  Natal in  1947-48. In  1951 he was picked to tour  England on the strength of 138 in a 12-a-side (and thus non-first-class) Test trial at  Kingsmead. He hit 40 when  South Africa won at  Trent Bridge but failed in his next three innings, and was dropped. But he scored consistently in the county games, and his agile fielding in the deep was widely noted. When the young  South Africa team stunned  Australia by drawing their  series 18 months later,  McGlew was established as the opening bat and, aged only 23, as vice-captain. Though he missed the crucial win at the MCG through injury, he returned in  New Zealand with 255 not out in eight hours 54 minutes, then  South Africa's highest Test score. He was on the field throughout the match. Back in  England in  1955, he scored centuries in both  South Africa's Test wins, at  Manchester and  Leeds, having bagged a pair at  Lord's the game before.  McGlew was captain in both games because Jack Cheetham was injured;  South Africa lost the other three Tests.  McGlew was a Cricketer of the Year; Wisden noted both his dourness at the crease and his vitality in the field.  Attrition is not a popular method of progress.

Arthur Beaumont Chudleigh Langton was a member of the team which in 1935 gained the first triumph for South Africa in England, their victory by 157 runs at Lord's being the only definite result in the rubber. In that match he took six wickets for 89--four for 31 in England's second innings, after helping Bruce Mitchell (164 not out) add 101 in two hours. This stand enabled H. F. Wade to apply the closure when Langton returned a catch to W. R. Hammond. The wonderful bowling of X. Balaskas contributed perhaps more than anything else to that success, but in the five Tests, Langton, with fifteen wickets, came second to C. L. Vincent in effectiveness, while his batting average of 30.25 showed his all-round value. In the whole tour he excelled among the bowlers with 115 wickets at 21.16 each, and scored 537 runs--average 21.48. He played his highest innings of the tour, 73 not out, at the Oval, where he and E. L. Dalton, 117, added 137 in seventy minutes, a ninth wicket record for matches between England and South Africa. Such valuable batting late in the innings was characteristic of Langton, and he concluded the tour at Scarborough by making 20 and 68 when runs were wanted badly, so helping to remove fear of defeat from H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's powerful side in a very keen match.  \n"", 'The youngest member of the team of 15 players who came over, Langton also was the tallest, and he made the most of his six feet three inches by bringing the ball well over at good medium pace. Accurate in length, with late swerve and spin, if the pitch helped, he did not require the new ball to trouble batsmen, but could go on at any time, and always needed careful watching for lift, break or change of speed. With the bat he showed ability in defence, but was at his best when forcing the game with pulls, drives and cuts. He was a worthy member of a fine fielding side, and altogether proved himself a most capable all-round cricketer. ', ""Immediately after this tour he played in all five Tests when Australia first sent a team direct to South Africa. Like many of his colleagues, Langton seemed as if suffering from the effects of the heavy work in England. The Australians went through 16 matches without defeat and won four of the Tests, the other being cut short by rain. Langton made 45 and 20, and twice took four wickets in an innings for Transvaal, but could not find his form in the Tests; his 12 wickets - most for South Africa - cost 44.33 runs apiece, and his batting average fell to 6.88. Against England's successful team captained by W. R. Hammond in 1938-39, Langton went through another trying experience without adequate reward. His 13 Test wickets cost 51 runs apiece, and seven innings brought him only 115 runs, while in the final match, which remained unfinished after ten days, he bowled 91 overs for 203 runs and four wickets.

So ineffective however was he on turf that when the MCC were in South Africa in 1930-31, although in the first Test he took 11 for 150 and in the second innings of the fourth, when admittedly the English batsmen were hitting recklessly in a vain endeavour to force a win, 6 for 46, he was omitted from the third and fifth Tests, the first two ever to be played on grass in South Africa. \n"", ""Similarly in this country in 1924, when, after his record at home, he was expected to be one of the main match-winners, he was a complete failure. It is true that he was handicapped by injury, but the general impression was that, even when fit, he was not formidable. He never toured abroad again. What he could do in his own country was shown against the Hon. L. H.

In nine of his 28 matches for them he took over ten wickets and against Griqualand West in 1931-32 took 9 for 48 in an innings and 16 for 136 in the match. He first attracted attention by taking six for 89 for the Transvaal against the great Australian side of 1921. Handicapped by having lost an eye at the age of four, he was not normally regarded as a serious batsman. However in the third Test against England in 1927-28, he made 51 and 69, he and his captain, H. G. Deane, putting on 95 for the eighth wicket in the first innings and 123 for the seventh in the second.', ""Tall and strongly built, he bowled fast-medium right-hand round the wicket and on the mat his off-break spun prodigiously, came off very quick and lifted sharply.

W. 'Dave' Nourse, although the war cost him many Test appearances. The first of his 34 Test matches was at  Trent Bridge in 1935, and the last at The Oval in 1951. In that time he scored 2960 runs, with nine centuries (seven against England), at the rare average of 53.81, and established a reputation as a fighting batsman, defensive when need be but ever ready to punch the ball with all the strength of his beefy forearms. \n"", ""His most renowned innings was 208 in the Nottingham Test of 1951. Coming into the match (at the age of 40) with his broken right thumb pinned, he batted for nine hours, gritting his teeth against the pain, and not only registering South Africa's first double-century against England, but captaining South Africa to their first Test victory for 16 years."", 'And yet his finest innings from a technical point of view was his 115 at Old Trafford four years earlier, on his second tour of England, when he was vice-captain. On a spiteful pitch, with the ball rearing from a length, he hit 13 fours and two sixes before being yorked by Edrich.', ' Nourse\'s first tour of England, in 1935, brought him little Test success, though he scored a century in each innings against Surrey in May, followed immediately by 148 against  Oxford, compelling \'Plum\' Warner to utter the squelcher: \'A  Nourse, a Nourse, my kingdom for a Nourse."" An unbeaten 160 against Warwickshire in August helped him towards an aggregate for the tour of 1681 (av. 41). Back home, Nourse did well against the 1935-36 Australians, making 91 in the first Test and 231 in the second, still a Test record for the city of Johannesburg. The innings lasted no more than 289 minutes, contained 36 boundaries, and was the highest for South Africa in any Test at the time -- and yet was over-shadowed somewhat by Stan McCabe\'s glorious 189 not out on the last day, when Wade appealed successfully in the stormy gloom in the interests of his fieldsmen.', ""Such was the international calendar in those days that it was just on three years before South Africa's next Test match, and Nourse, having made runs galore for Natal, partook of the high scoring in the home  series against England, making centuries in the Cape Town Test and in the final match, the 'timeless Test' at  Durban."", ""During war service in the Middle East, he smote nine sixes off nine balls (including all six in an over) in a match in Alexandria; but, having lost his peak years to the war, he had also lost some of his health and his slimness. Gradually he found his form again, and  England in 1947 saw a redoubtable Nourse. His stand of 319 with Melville in the opening Test, at Trent Bridge, remains the second-highest in South Africa's Test history, and a further century flashed from his bat -- in a losing cause -- in the third Test, at Old Trafford. He renewed acquaintances with Edgbaston with an unbeaten 205 against  Warwickshire, and in The Oval Test he was given out bowled for 97 only after an umpires' consultation. His 621 runs (av. 69) topped the Springbok averages, and only the phenomenal figures of Edrich and Compton exceeded his on the English side."", ""A year later his form still held as he captained against England in a losing series, making centuries in the Cape Town and Johannesburg Tests and leading the averages of both sides with 76.57. A year later he scored consistently in the four defeats by Australia, reaching three figures at Cape Town. And at last, in the  1951 series in England, he led his country to a victory, his 208 at Nottingham receiving the necessary support from the bowlers. The rest of the tour was anticlimax, England winning three of the other four Tests. Nourse's ninth century, however, placed him on a pinnacle, still unmatched today, eleven years into South Africa's isolation."", ""In all first-class cricket in South Africa or for his country overseas Dudley Nourse made six double-centuries, to occupy second place to his father, who made seven. Altogether the son, of whom the father was so proud, scored 12,472 runs at the outstanding average of 51.37, with 41 centuries, unequalled by any Springbok apart from Graeme Pollock among those who have not played domestic cricket in England or  Australia. Dudley Nourse did not tour Australia, but had 'connections'. When he was born, on November 12, 1910, his father had just made 201 not out against South Australia at Adelaide; the new-born was named after  Australia's Governor-General.

Nel was sent home from the South Africa A tour of Australia in 2003 after being stopped by Tasmanian police and found to be driving under the influence of alcohol. It was the latest in a string of misdemeanors, but not enough to preclude his selection in the South African one-day squad for the tour of England in 2003, for which he was forced to take a temporary break from his contract with Northamptonshire. Nel was tipped from an early age as a future international and he first made the headlines in February 2001 when he felled his hero Allan Donald with a fierce bouncer during a domestic first-class match. Although Nel burst into tears when Donald was forced to leave the field, it later emerged that he was following instructions from coach Ray Jennings to target South Africa's premier fast bowler.  \n"", ""Further controversy followed later that year, when Nel was one of five South African players found guilty of smoking marijuana during the tour of the West Indies. However, it was during the home West Indies series in 2003-04, during which he got married, that he established himself as a permanent member of the Test team - and was only in trouble once, for making facial gestures to Chris Gayle. A back injury curtailed his progress, but he returned with wickets and more facial contortions against England in 2004-05. Nel came into his own during South Africa's tour of Australia at the end of 2005, where he was an intimidating presence with 14 wickets and an attacking mindset. Four dismissals on Boxing Day led to a strong showing at Sydney, and his ability to fight against the backdrop of racial taunts from the Australian crowd was tough. Failed to back his words, however, during a return series at home, finishing with only six wickets, and was involved in a heated argument with Adam Gilchrist in the second Test after being slammed for 22 runs.

"", ""Chipped in with wickets and more than a mouthful of words and cheeky grins against India at home, but will probably be remembered most from the Test series for being at the receiving end of a big six and a famous impromptu dance from Indian pace bowler Sreesanth.

However, his spells against England and Bangladesh showed what he brought to the attack and his commitment was never questioned.

That innings, and a matchwinning 48 in the third Test at Durban, seemed to shed his reputation as a one-day flasher. But by the start of the 2002-03 season, his form had fallen away horribly, and he failed in four consecutive home Tests against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka."", ""However, Prince returned to the side following some good domestic performances, and valuable knocks in the middle order against the West Indies and England at home has seen Prince become a more regular member of the South Africa one-day side. Despite two hundreds in the 2004-05 season - an unbeaten 139 against Zimbabwe at Centurion and 131 in South Africa's 2-0 rout of the West Indies - Prince still does not find himself an automatic selection in the longer format of the game. Long rated highly by SA's cricket supremo Ali Bacher, Prince is strong through the off side, and was Western Province's player of the year in 2001. His throwing from the deep has been hampered by a long-term shoulder injury, but he remains a brilliant shot-stopping fielder in the covers. The highlight of his career was a fine 119 in the third Test against Australia at Sydney in early 2006, but it was during this series that he became bunny to a legend: Shane Warne. Warne dismissed him in the first five innings - though Prince played the rest of the bowlers admirably - and troubled him plentiful when South Africa hosted Australia in March. Scores of 17, 27, 33 and 7 overshadowed a fantastic 93 in the first innings at Johannesburg."", ""In July 2006 he was named as South Africa's first non-white captain in the absence of the injured Graeme Smith. The result was a disappointing 2-0 whitewash at the hands of Sri Lanka. Prince made way for Mark Boucher to captain in the tri-series, also featuring India, which was ultimately aborted following South Africa's withdrawal over security concerns. Prince was not included in South Africa's squad for the Champions Trophy, but continued his sterling 2006 Test form against India at home. The highest run-scorer on either side in the three-Test contest, Prince's series highlights included an outstanding 97 in a loss at Johannesburg and a third career hundred at Cape Town."", ""When Pakistan toured next, Prince was the only centurion in the three-Test series. His 138 laid the foundations for victory in the first Test at Centurion Park, and his numbers can't be argued with, as he ended the season's six Tests averaging 60.67. It was enough to earn him a recall to the one-day side, including a ticket to the West Indies for the World Cup, but it was a disappointing tournament and he was again omitted for the short tour of Ireland. He enjoyed a reasonable summer against West Indies, however, with 263 runs in the three Tests, and began the subsequent tour of England in scintillating form, with a crucial momentum-shifting century at Lord's, and a brilliant matchwinning 149 at Headingley."", ""Just as it seemed Prince's career was heading in exactly the right direction, he was derailed. He broke his thumb ahead of the 2008-9 series against Australia and lost his place to JP Duminy, who won the series with a sterling undefeated 166 in Melbourne. Although Prince was promised his role back, he did not get it and was only recalled for the return series against Australia at home, when an injury ruled Smith out again. "", 'Prince was asked to captain and open the batting but refused the former if he could not choose his position in the line-up. Jaques Kallis led the side and Prince opened and scored a defiant 150 to announce his return. That was the last of his 11 centuries.

Dad Peter led the South African attack through the 1960s; uncle Graeme was one of the finest, if not the finest, left-hander to play the game. Shaun has bits of both in his makeup, but it is as an immaculate, Hadlee-esque, line and length seamer that he has established himself. At the start of his first-class career, though, he was both slippery and aggressive and his Natal team-mates delighted in totting up the number of batsmen he pinned match after match. He was brought into the South African Test side against Michael Atherton's England tourists in 1995/96 and although his father was the convener of selectors, there was never a hint of nepotism and the younger Pollock took quickly to the higher level.  \n"", ""In 1996 he had a spell with Warwickshire cut short because of an ankle injury and missed the tour to India at the end of that year. But he soon returned to resume his new-ball partnership with Allan Donald and this pairing was the springboard of much of South Africa's success during the latter half of the 1990s. Indeed, it is possible to argue that the emergence of Pollock inspired Donald to greater heights as the latter found himself with a partner who both complemented and challenged him. Perhaps the straightest bowler in world cricket, Pollock is able to move the ball both ways at a lively pace. He also possesses stamina and courage in abundance as in proved in Adelaide in 1998 when he toiled on hour after hour in blazing heat to take 7 for 87 in 41 overs on a perfect batting pitch. "", ""If there is a criticism of Pollock, it is that he has underperformed with the bat, but most Test teams would be perfectly happy to have him in their side if he never scored a run. Pollock was thrust into the captaincy in April 2000 when Hansie Cronje was drummed out of the game, and he faced the biggest challenge of his career - to lift a shocked and demoralised South African side. However, after a solid start to his captaincy, he lost some credibility after a 3-0 drubbing in Australia in 2001-02, and was later blamed for South Africa's disastrous World Cup in which they failed to qualify for the Super Sixes. As a result, Pollock immediately lost the captaincy and was replaced by Graeme Smith. \nThough his nagging brilliance around offstump remains, his pace and ability to take wickets at the top of the order has dipped. "", ""Pollock missed the first Test against Australia at home in early 2006 with a back injury and was relegated from opener to first-change by the third. Four wickets in two Tests, with a new run-up and on pitches tailormade for his style, showed that he has slowed. But with 100 Tests under his belt, Pollock remains an integral part of the side. He missed the first Test against Sri Lanka due to the birth of his second daughter, returned for the second and was a pale shade of his former self. He managed just one wicket, and it was a telling sign of what appeared to be Pollock's decline to see him resort to offspin after being tonked over his head for six by Sanath Jayasuriya. All that was reversed in the Champions Trophy in India, where he showed great form, and against India and Pakistan at home at the end of 2006 and in the new year. Man of the Series in both the ODIs and Tests against India, Pollock was highly impressive with the new ball and chipped in with useful scores down the order. It was fitting that he became the first South African to take 400 Test wickets. Pollock continued his fine form against the touring Pakistanis next, despite being surprisingly rested for the final Test. Thrifty with the ball and useful with bat he offered precious control and breathing space for his captain. In the ODI series, he was the highest wicket-taker on either side and his 5 for 23 in the final game crushed a weary Pakistan. For the second consecutive one-day series in a row, Pollock was adjudged Man of the Series. It was decent form to carry into his fourth World Cup, but his lack of pace was exposed on the small Caribbean grounds, especially by Matthew Hayden, although his miserly spell against England was key in South Africa securing a semi-final berth. He lost his place in the Test line-up late in 2007 but returned against West Indies, on his home ground in Durban, for what turned out to be his final Test. He announced his retirement midway through the match, the following one-day series being his last international commitments."", '\n', ' January 2008']","['Natal debut 1992/93', 'Warwickshire 1996', 'Education: Northwood HS, Natal Univ (Dbn)', 'Junior Representative Cricket: Ntl Nuff 1991, SA Scho', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2003']",108.0,156.0,39.0,3781.0,111,32.31,7198.0,52.52,2.0,16.0,412.0,35.0,72.0,0.0,303.0,205,72,3519.0,130,26.45,4059,86.69,1,14,248,58,108.0,0.0,12.0,9,2,86.0,36*,12.28,70,122.85,0,0,4,4,2.0,0.0,186.0,267,55,7023,150*,33.12,,,6,35,,,132,0,435.0,297,91,5494,134*,26.66,,,3,24,,,153.0,0.0,46.0,34,7,569,59,21.07,401,141.89,0,1,45,28,9.0,0.0,108.0,202,24353,9733,421.0,7/87,10/147,23.11,2.39,57.8,23,16,1,303.0,297,15712,9631,393.0,6/35,6/35,24.5,3.67,39.9,12,5,0,12.0,11,243,309,15.0,3/28,3/28,20.60,7.62,16.2,0,0,0,186.0,,39067,15508,667,7/33,,23.25,2.38,58.5,,22,2,435.0,,21588,13141,573,6/21,6/21,22.93,3.65,37.6,18,7,0,46.0,43,937,996,45,3/12,3/12,22.13,6.37,20.8,0,0,0,True,True,False,True

Peterson, a left-arm finger spinner from Eastern Province, fills all three vacancies more than competently. At first glance he seems an overly orthodox slow bowler, but he turns the ball appreciably given help from the pitch and is invariably a tidy operator with a steadily developing understanding of flight. Peterson has also cultivated an unusual delivery that turns into the right-handed batsmen.He was part of the South African Under-19 team that took on Pakistan and England, and he played the Under-19 World Cup in 1998. Peterson made his Test debut in 2003 against Bangladesh, taking five wickets and scored 61. It was in Bangladesh where he took his first five-wicket haul as well, on the 2008 tour. \n', ""Given more chances in ODIs, Peterson eventually began to grab his opportunities and his bowling, in particular, developed very usefully. He was part of South Africa's squad at the 2007 World Cup and hit the winning boundary - an outside edge past slip - in South Africa's one-wicket victory over Sri Lanka at Providence. He slipped out of national contention for a time, and didn't play for South Africa again for two years, but in the meantime represented the Warriors with distinction. In April 2009 he moved to Cape Town and, despite having a year remaining on his Warriors contract, requested a transfer to the Cape Cobras because his partner wanted to pursue her career in the Western Cape. "", ""Peterson feared that he was simply treading water, however, and came close to relinquishing his dreams of further honours with South Africa. He made himself unavailable for national selection and headed to Derbyshire as a Kolpak player. Nevertheless, he was named in South Africa's squad for the 2011 World Cup, and though his inclusion was initally greeted by scepticism in some quarters, Peterson proved the doubters wrong with some superb all-round performances.

Indeed, although he continued to play up to 1930 his last appearance in South Africa itself had been as long before as 1912-13,\nwhen he played in one game only. As against this he was in the 1924 team to England and played more domestic cricket in England when back on leave than he ever played in South Africa though, unhappily, not much in either country. This was a great loss to South Africa for he would have been an early choice for the\n1913-14 Test team (the Barnes tour) and probably for the teams in the early 1920s also. In all he played in only 16 Tests. Although Pegler had only limited success in Australia, he was a great success in England in 1912, one of the very few South African successes. Tall, strong and fit - and, though it has no bearing on the matter, handsome also - he was admirably equipped to bear the brunt of the bowling. In fact he was given little rest. He played in 34 of the 37 first-class matches and took 189 wickets, the highest ever by a South African. His success extended to the Tests also. Although South Africa were heavily beaten in five of the six Tests, he took 29 wickets at the modest average of 21, including 7 for 65 against England at Lord's. Lord's, and particularly when bowling from the pavilion end, provided him with some of his finest performances. Earlier, against MCC he had taken 6 for 44. On the 1924 tour he took 8 for 54, his best bowling performance, against MCC and, to cap a remarkable series, in his very last match in 1930, for MCC he skittled out Wales with 4 for 14 and 6 for 62. He was then just 42. Pegler was not in the original team selected to tour England in 1924 but by a happy chance was on the same ship as the team, with some months leave ahead of him. Permission was sought, and granted, to include him if he was fit and in form. What the team would have done\nwithout him is painful to contemplate. Without repeating fully his 1912 success, he took 108 wickets, second only to J. M. Blanckenberg with 119. The team was even weaker than in 1912, perhaps the weakest ever sent overseas by any country. This time Pegler could not repeat his 1912 Test successes, but his total `bag'\nof nine Test wickets was still the highest of the team. Pegler subsequently made a third trip to England in 1951 as manager, and it is a sad commentary on a splendid player that he was associated with three of the least successful\nSouth African teams to tour England.

Rhodesian-born Partridge, for some years a vagrant alcoholic, turned a gun on himself on June 7 in a police station in a suburb of Harare after having been arrested for not paying a bill at a hotel. He was 55. \n', 'Born in Bulawayo on Dec 9, 1932, he made his debut for Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1951, but, with Adcock and Heine at their peak, it was some years before he earned higher consideration. In 1959-60 he had the remarkable figures of 7 for 9 against Border, and in 1961-62, when he took 53 wickets at only 13.98 in seven matches, he ran through Natal with 8 for 69 and 6 for 32 at Salisbury. When he broke the South African record with 64 wickets (16.68) in the 1962-63 season his claim to a Test trial was irresistible.', ""He went with Trevor Goddard's side to Australia and New Zealand in 1963-64, and was a huge success. Using the humidity and the breezes which have so often befriended medium-pacers at Australia's coastal cricket centres, Joe Partridge, bespectacled and so obviously a banker by occupation, purred in to take nine wickets in the NSW match and after an unsuccessful Test debut at Brisbane (where Ian Meckiff was no-balled for throwing) and five wickets at Melbourne, he took nine more in the Sydney Test, including Lawry, O'Neill, Burge, Booth (twice) and Shepherd. After a fairly barren time at Adelaide, where Barlow and Pollock had their marvellous stand of 341 and South Africa levelled at 1-1, Partridge put his personal seal on the series with 7 for 91 in Australia's first innings at Sydney in the excitingly drawn final Test. He thus took 27 wickets (18.67) off 148.1 eight-ball overs in his three first-class matches at Sydney Cricket Ground."", 'Joint leading wicket-taker in the series with Peter Pollock (25) for either side, Partridge went on to take 13 more wickets in the three drawn Tests in New Zealand, including figures of 6 for 86 at Auckland. His 62 wickets on the tour overall placed him five ahead of Pollock, and Australasian spectators were generous in their praise of a tireless and skilful bowler who specialised in the in-ducker but was also capable of running the ball away to the slips.\nWhen England toured South Africa in 1964-65, Partridge took six wickets for Rhodesia (including Boycott in each innings) but found success elusive in the three Tests in which he played. His six wickets cost 293 runs, and he had worn Springbok colours for the last time.', 'In Currie Cup matches Partridge took 195 wickets at 18.81, while in his 11 Tests he took 44 wickets at 31.20. He began to drink a lot when employed as a brewery representative, and he and his wife, who had four children, divorced five years ago. He managed to overcome a wasting disease caused by microbes in the water. He had been in financial difficulties for some time.', ""Brian Bassano writes: Joe Partridge established himself in 1952-53 by taking 33 wickets at 19.06, and did even better two years later with 34 at 21.76, including 8 for 124 (11 wickets in the match) against Border. Against the touring Surrey team in 1959-60 he took 6 for 26 in 23 overs (as well as the 7 for 9 against Border), but was not chosen for the 1960 Springbok tour of England, where conditions would have suited him ideally. His 1962-63 domestic record of 64 wickets has only twice been exceeded, both times by Vintcent van der Bijl (65 in 1975-76 and 75 in 1981-82). When he took all those wickets at Sydney on the 1963-64 tour, his fielding position down at third man became known as 'Joe's corner'. Well-built and strong, the bespectacled Partridge was a fine team man, and will be remembered with affection.\n""]",['South African Cricket Annual Cricketer of the Year 1963'],11.0,12.0,5.0,73.0,13*,10.42,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,77.0,91,34,523,29*,9.17,,,0,0,,,21,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,20,3684,1373,44.0,7/91,9/176,31.2,2.23,83.7,3,3,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,77.0,,20266,7812,376,8/69,,20.77,2.31,53.8,,24,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

It was only when he moved to a bigger city, Pretoria, that he gave cricket a proper go and it did not take long before he was considered a serious prospect. He played just seven first-class matches before he was selected for South Africa and made his debut against England in 2004, in the same match as AB de Villiers.

', 'A visibly fired-up Steyn took ten wickets in the first Test in Johannesburg. Then, shortly after lunch on the first day of the second Test in Centurion, he delivered a short ball to Craig Cumming, who missed. The ball crashed into his face and sent him to intensive care.

Eric Rowan ranked with Dudley Nourse and Bruce Mitchell in the very forefront of Test batsman from South Africa in the years before and after the Second World War. His long career (1929-30 to 1953-54) was spiced by controversy. He was always fearless -- he sometimes batted without gloves and, so it was said, box -- and not only as a batsman. He was small and wiry and cocky and feisty and contemptuous of authority. Having been left out of the 1947 tour of England because of personality clashes, he was chosen in 1951, as vice-captain, when he often had to lead the team because Nourse was injured, and dominated the tour.', ""Rowan, who played all his first-class cricket in South Africa for Transvaal, except for one season with Eastern Province, was a regular opener, occasionally going in at No. 3. He was a right-handed bat without much elegance, but with all the strokes. His maiden century came a year after his debut and by 1935 he was a natural choice to tour England. He made his Test debut at  Trent Bridge and played throughout South Africa's successful series, though he did better outside the Tests, scoring 1,948 on the tour. "", ' was a little surprised: He did not bat either with dignity or precision; he regarded his cricket in most light-hearted style, but his confidence was amazing. Rowan lost some of that confidence against the Australians in 1935-36, when  Grimmett took his wicket five times out of six until he was dropped. And he struggled for form in some of the seasons before the war until he scored 306 not out against Natal in a first-class friendly in 1939-40, which stood as the highest score made in  South Africa until 1993-94. As soon as non-competitive first-class cricket was resumed, he almost scored another triple-century, hitting 284 for  Eastern Province against Griqualand West in 1945-46.', ""His non-selection for the 1947 tour was baffling, except in terms of character. But he was recalled when  Nourse took over the captaincy from Melville and scored 156 not out to save the Test at Ellis Park in 1948-49, after the selectors had announced that he was dropped for the next Test. He batted six hours and reputedly found time to give the selectors a V-sign. He said he was giving the V for Victory; told that it was the wrong way round the supposedly replied: That depends what part of the ground you're sitting. He was soon restored, though it was said his relations with Nourse were strained, and he got better and better. He made 277 not out for Transvaal against  Griqualand West in 1950-51, then the highest Currie Cup score, and scored 176 before lunch against Rhodesia. He averaged 109 that season. But even in triumph he found trouble. He was one of "", ""'s Five for his achievement in England in 1951. But, early on the tour, he and John Waite were slow handclapped by the crowd at Old Trafford during the Lancashire match. They sat down until there was quiet and later Rowan was involved in a scuffle in the pavilion. He was not picked for Australia in 1952-53 though, at 43, he was still in prime form; that, however, applied both to his batting and his effing and blinding at officialdom.

He played 15 Tests, all against  England, between 1947 and 1951, and made a speciality of dismissing  Len Hutton: 11 times in all, including five in a row at the end of the  1948-49 series and the First Test of  1951. Morally, the figure might be 12: he was the bowler at  The Oval when  Hutton was given out for obstruction after impeding  wicket-keeper Russell Endean as he tried to take a simple catch.  Hutton rated  Rowan almost as high as  Laker.  Rowan's achievements were the more remarkable since his leg was damaged by a wartime explosion: he was unable to put his full weight on the front foot, often bowled in pain, and sometimes in leg irons. In his way, he was as courageous as his famously feisty older brother Eric, but Athol's way was more good-humoured and quiet. He also suffered slightly different privations on the  1947 tour:  England was still in the grip of rationing, and  Rowan was a famous trencherman. Before the war, he had bowled fast-medium. When he came back, having escaped from the Germans when taken prisoner in the Western desert, he turned into an  off-spinner while retaining something more like a seam bowler's grip. His most dramatic performance came at The Wanderers in  1949-50, when he took nine for 19 as  Transvaal bowled the mighty  Australians out for 84. Set 69 to win,  Transvaal were bowled out for 53 themselves. But  Rowan's captain, Dudley Nourse, singled out his performance against  England at  Port Elizabeth a year earlier when he bowled almost unchanged for figures of 60-9-166-5.  It had to be seen to be appreciated, wrote Nourse.  As I called on his reserve of energy he unfailingly gave of his best without ever a murmur. A wholehearted bowler is Athol Rowan, but not a lucky one. He missed the Tests against  Australia through injury, and the pain forced him to retire after the  1951 tour of  England.\n"", ' \n']",[],15.0,23.0,6.0,290.0,41,17.05,,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,58.0,82,20,1492,100*,24.06,,,1,4,,,25,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,25,5193,2084,54.0,5/68,8/232,38.59,2.40,96.1,2,4,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,58.0,,16755,6408,273,9/19,,23.47,2.29,61.3,,20,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Rhodes worked harder than anyone else in a team of hard workers, frequently delaying the team bus at the end of practice for one more round of reflex catches hit from ten metres or less. Nobody has ever fielded better in the key one-day position of backward point, where he leapt like a salmon, threw off balance, and stopped singles by reputation alone. He laboured just as hard over his batting which needed, and underwent, a complete technical overhaul in 1997 - whereupon he averaged 50 for the rest of his Test career, until he gave it up to concentrate on one-day cricket in 2000. The problem was a tendency to bring the bat down from gully and through to midwicket, a legacy of the extraordinary hockey skills that brought him selection for the Olympic Games in 1996 - an offer he had to refuse. Few batsmen have turned the quick single into a finer art form, and his willingness to experiment and adapt enabled him to lead the way with the reverse-sweep under Bob Woolmer's tutelage. But Rhodes was just as likely to delay the bus by relentlessly signing autographs for gaggles of persistent children; the arrival of his own, a daughter, was instrumental in his semi-retirement. Indeed, Rhodes may have become the first cricketer to claim paternity leave. Rightly, there is give and take in Rhodes's life. He has more endorsements than any team-sport player in South Africa's history, is at the forefront of the sporting dotcom revolution, and is constantly exploring the boundaries and horizons of commerce. His final retirement was hastened by an inopportune finger-fracture early in the 2003 World Cup, although there was still time for a successful farewell season in county cricket for Gloucestershire.\n"", ' \n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1999'],52.0,80.0,9.0,2532.0,117,35.66,5467.0,46.31,3.0,17.0,256.0,22.0,34.0,0.0,245.0,220,51,5935.0,121,35.11,7336,80.90,2,33,392,47,105.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,164.0,263,31,9546,172,41.14,,,22,52,,,127,0,371.0,339,68,8907,121,32.86,,,2,51,,,158.0,0.0,6.0,5,0,49,42,9.80,52,94.23,0,0,3,1,1.0,0.0,52.0,2,12,5,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.50,-,0,0,0,245.0,2,14,4,0.0,-,-,32.91,1.71,-,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,164.0,,162,83,1,1/13,,83.00,3.07,162.0,,0,0,371.0,,80,45,2,1/2,1/2,22.50,3.37,40.0,0,0,0,6.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

Tall and powerfully built, he liked nothing more than to hit the ball hard or bowl as fast as he could.  In 1898-99 he scored 86 (as an opener) at Johannesburg and followed with a brilliant 106 at Cape Town (South Africa's first Test hundred) against the all-conquering England side led by Lord Hawke.  At Cape Town he also took 6 for 26 and 3 for 63.  In 1901 he toured England and cemented his reputation as a big hitter but failed to put together many innings of substance - the same could be said of his visits in 1904 and 1907.   But as a bowler he excelled on the green wickets,  with his high action to the fore, and he took 107 wickets in 1901 and 100 in 1904.  He was fortunate to make the 1901 tour - he was captured by the Boers (the Boer war was taking place) and had to escape from a POW camp and make his way to safety behind the British lines.   At home his form remained breathtaking. In 1902-03 he scored back-to-back centuries against Australia at Johannesburg and Cape Town - his second hundred taking 80 minutes -  and  in 1905 grabbed 21 wickets against England.   By 1907 South Africa were dominated by their quartet of googly bowlers, and he was largely marginalised, although his slogging continued to thrill.   Against England in 1909-10 and Australia the following winter he struggled to impose himself with either bat or ball, and he died in 1913, aged 36.  Sinclair not only excelled at cricket; he played rugby for South Africa and England, and was also a skilled hockey and football player.\n"", ' \n', '\nJimmy Sinclair, who died at Yeoville on February 23rd, was one of the first men who made South African cricket famous.  He came into prominence during the tour of Lord Hawke""s team in South Africa in the winter of 1898-99. In that tour the Englishmen played seventeen matches, of which they won fifteen and drew two. A couple of defeats at Matjesfontein and Cape Town were suffered in scratch games outside the regular programme. Little in the cricket of the South African players at that time suggested the rapid development that followed, but Sinclair met with brilliant success. Playing for South Africa at Johannesburg in February, 1899, he scored 86, and at Cape Town in April he did even better, playing a brilliant innings of 106, and taking nine wickets - six for 26 runs and three for 63. These two matches established his reputation as the best all-round man in South Africa. Coming to England with the South African team in 1901, he fulfilled expectations as a bowler, but his batting was disappointing. Despite his great hitting powers he made only 742 runs during the tour, with an average of 19.5. On his next visit to England, with the South African team in 1904, Mr. Sinclair again bowled very well, taking 100 wickets, but it became evident that as a batsman he was little more than a big hitter. His last visit to England, was with the famous side of 1907. This time he was not wanted much as a bowler, being quite overshadowed by Schwarz, Vogler, Faulkner, and Gordon White. In batting, too, he had quite a modest record, but on occasions his hitting was tremendous, notably in a remarkable match against Sussex at Brighton. The South Africans won by 39 runs after starting the game with a paltry score of 49. In their second innings they made 327, Sinclair hitting up 92 out of 135 in an hour and forty minutes. As a bowler Sinclair, at his best, was excellent, combining a nice variety of pace with a very high delivery. Among his best feats with the ball in this country may be mentioned:-', 'In Test Matches against England and Australia he made 1069 runs, with an average of 23.23, and took 63 wickets at a cost of 31.68 runs each. His hundreds were 106 v. England at Cape Town in 1898-9, and 101 and 104 v. Australia, at Johannesburg and Cape Town respectively, in 1902-3. In making the last-mentioned score he hit ten 6""s and eight 4""s. In February, 1897, he scored 301 not out for Villagers v. Roodeport, at Johannesburg, an innings which still ranks as the record for South Africa.\n']",['Brother of D.M.

Educated at St Paul's School in London, he was an ordinary cricketer who played a few times for Middlesex  before emigrating to South Africa.  He returned with the 1904 South African side, and learned the art of bowling the googly from BJT Bosanquet, passing the knowledge on to his team-mates.   While others embraced the googly into their repertoire, Schwarz used it as his stock delivery, relying on the ball picking up speed off the pitch and lifting sharply, often to packed leg-side fields.  In 1904 he headed the bowling averages with 65 wickets at 18.26, and did so again in 1907 with 137 wickets at 11.70.  he also enjoyed success in Australia in 1910-11, with 59 wickets at 25.00, including 5 for 102 and 6 for 47 in the first and fifth Tests at Sydney.   Before emigrating to South Africa he played three times for England at rugby as a half-back, and won a Blue at Cambridge in 1893.  A quiet man, he died of Spanish Influenza on the Western Front seven days after the Armistice in 1918.\n"", ' \n', ' ', ""\nMajor Schwarz, as every one knows, was famous as a slow bowler. Few men did so much to establish the reputation of South African cricket. He learnt the game in England and played for  Middlesex before going to South Africa. In those early days, however, he did not make any great mark. His fame began when he returned to this country with the South African team of 1904. Studying very carefully the method of B. J. T. Bosanquet, he acquired, and afterwards carried to a high standard, the art of bowling off-breaks with, to all appearance, a leg-break action. He did very well in 1904, but his success that year was only a foretaste of far greater things to come. In the brilliant tour of 1907 he and Vogler and G. A. Faulkner raised South African cricket to the highest pitch it has ever reached. He was less successful than his two comrades in the Test Matches against England, but for the whole tour he was easily first in bowling, taking 143 wickets at a cost of 11½ runs each. He proved rather disappointing in Australia, and in the Triangular Tournament in this country in 1912 he failed. Before going to South Africa Schwarz was an International half-back at Rugby football, playing against Scotland in  1899 and against Wales and Ireland two seasons later. He also played for Cambridge against Oxford in 1893. He was born on May 4, 1875, and was educated at St. Paul's School. Inasmuch as he always made the ball turn from the off and had no leg-break  Schwarz was not in the strict sense of the word a googly bowler, and was in this respect inferior to his colleagues Vogler and Faulkner. Still, when at his best, he was a truly formidable opponent, his accuracy of length in the season of 1907, in combination with such a big break, being extraordinary."", ""The writer of the obituary notice in the Times said: Personally `Reggie' Schwarz was a man of exceptional charm, and his untimely death will bring real sorrow to his hosts of friends in many parts of the world. He had the great gift of absolute modesty and self-effacement. No one meeting him casually would ever have guessed the renown he had won in the world of sport. Quiet, almost retiring, in manner; without the least trace of side; and with a peculiarly attractive voice and way of speaking, Schwarz impelled and commanded the affection even of acquaintances. During his years in South Africa he was secretary to Sir Abe Bailey -- a post which his social gifts enabled him to fill with remarkable success. Before coming to Europe for service in France, he had won distinction in the campaign in German South-West Africa. All who knew him knew that at the first possible opportunity he would be in the field in France, quietly and unostentatiously devoting all his gifts -- gifts that were bound to ensure his success as an officer -- to the service of his country.

He played over a span of twenty years for his country, beginning with the Triangular Tournament of 1912 and bowing out with the tour to Australia of H. B. Cameron's team of 1931-32 when he was rising 43.\nHe took part in ten series in all, leading South Africa in four of them, and in 42 Test matches made 2936 runs with an average of 4077. In terms of length and distinction of performance it could be said that no-one ever served South Africa better. Herby Taylor made seven hundreds in Test cricket, six of them on matting pitches, and it was on the mat that he first established himself, in 1913-14, as the youthful captain of a South African side that was considerably out-gunned\nby the full strength of England at a vintage time. The confrontation between Sydney Barnes, who took the record bag for any rubber anywhere of 49 wickets, and Taylor, who averaged 50 in his ten Test innings against him, is always\nremembered as one of the classics of history. 'The English cricketers were unanimous that finer batting than his against Barnes at his\nbest they never hoped to see,' says H. S. Altham, while Ian Peebles, who as a young man played two rubbers against him in South Africa, wrote of him in "", "" that he was `the ideal model for all aspiring batsmen'. Perhaps his most extraordinary triumph was at Durban on that 1913-14 tour in the only game in which MCC were beaten. Natal made 153 and 216, and Taylor, keeping Barnes's bowling to himself as much as he could, contributed 91 and 100. The basis of his play was the straightest of straight bats, nimble footwork, and an almost unfailing judgment of length. His method was so sound that he remained a beautiful player when nearer fifty than forty, and it was in this autumn of his career that I met him and played a little with him. He was an inexhaustible cricket talker, and despite his own playing orthodoxy propounded unusual theories. One recalls him holding genial court under the oaks at Newlands, and\nat Lord's during frequent visits to England. He was a man of much charm and that modesty regarding his own achievements which is so often a virtue of the great.

In a career extending from 1909 to 1935, he scored 13,105 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 41.87 and hit 30 centuries. Coached by George Cox, the Sussex bowler, when a boy at Michaelhouse School, Durban, Herbie Taylor developed at an early age. Strong in defence and a master of back-play, he possessed a variety of polished strokes which earned him 42 caps for South Africa and the position of captain of his country in 1913 at the age of 24. He was also captain against Australia in 1921 and against England in 1922 and 1924.

Between 1949-50 and 1960 he took 170 wickets in Tests at a cost of 25.91 in 37 matches.  Tayfield took more wickets per Test match (4.59) then either  Jim Laker or  Lance Gibbs (4.19 and 3.91), and though he was not in Laker's class as a spinner of the ball, he was exceptionally accurate and could bowl all day without wavering. He preferred to bowl over the wicket, extremely close to the stumps, which gave him the perfect angle for the ball to drift away and break back. Though his variations were subtle, his field settings were often flamboyantly unorthodox, with a large, tempting gap around extra cover but two straightish silly mid-ons waiting for the mistimed shot.  Tayfield was, with Trevor Goddard, at the centre of South Africa's containing cricket of the 1950s; he bowled 137 consecutive balls without conceding a run against  England at  Durban in  1956-57. But, with  South Africa's superb fielding to back him up, he ran through teams as well: he took 37 wickets that series at 17.18, including nine for 113 in the  second innings of the Fourth Test at  Johannesburg, when he bowled unchanged on the last day and sent down 35 eight-ball overs; the longer he bowled the more inhibited  England's batsmen became.  Tayfield was chaired off the field. \n"", ""The Tayfields were a cricketing family: Hugh's uncle S. H. Martin played for  Worcestershire and his brothers Arthur and Cyril both played for  Transvaal, as did two cousins. It was Arthur, as substitute, who took the final catch to seal the  Johannesburg triumph. Hugh first appeared for  Natal as a 17-year old in  1945-46. At 18, he took a hat-trick against  Transvaal and in  1949-50 was drafted into the Test team against  Australia when Athol Rowan was injured. He played in all five Tests and, on a sticky wicket at  Durban, took seven for 23 when  Australia crashed from 31 for no wicket to 75 all out (South Africa did not enforce the follow-on and Neil Harvey won the match for  Australia). He was summoned late to  England in 1951 as standby for  Rowan, but did not enhance his reputation. It was in  Australia, in  1952-53, as the attacking linchpin of Jack Cheetham's young side that stunned Australia by halving the series, that he moved into the front rank.  Tayfield took 30 wickets, 13 of them at  Melbourne to secure  South Africa's first win over  Australia in 42 years. In  England in  1955,  Tayfield took 143 wickets on the tour and 26 in the series. He took nine wickets in  South Africa's victory at  Headingley. At  The Oval, when  South Africa lost the deciding Test, he returned figures of 53.4-29-60-5. The Times said the batsmen treated him as respectfully as if he were a bishop on a diocesan visit. After his triumphs in 1956-57 his good days became less frequent.

Tayfield played 37 Tests and his 170 wickets came at 25.91 each; in first-class cricket his total was 864 at 21.86. He scored 862 Test runs at 16.90, and took 26 catches - he was one of  South Africa's best fielders himself.

Born at Swartwater, near Queenstown in Cape Colony, on November 28, 1876, he spent his boyhood at Durban, and made a name for himself at cricket with the Natal team at Johannesburg in November 1903. Going to live in Pretoria, he decided in 1905 to adopt cricket as a profession, and came to England with the intention of qualifying for Middlesex. He obtained an engagement on the M.C.C. ground staff, and in his second year at Lord's bowled on several occasions for the M.C.C. with brilliant success. The idea of Vogler qualifying for Middlesex aroused some feeling in 1906, the metropolitan county having already two Colonial players, Albert Trott and Frank Tarrant. Happily, any friction which might have arisen disappeared, Sir Abe Bailey finding a position for him. \n"", 'Returning home, Vogler played for South Africa in the five Tests against the team sent out under the leadership of P. F. Warner; the Englishmen suffered defeat in four of the games. In 1907 Vogler came here as one of the most famous bowling combinations that ever appeared for South Africa. The team lost by 53 runs the only Test match brought to a definite issue, but there could be no question about the exceptionally formidable attack which included four googly bowlers in Vogler, R. O. Schwartz, G. A. Faulkner and Gordon White, as well as Nourse and Sinclair. During the tour Vogler in first-class matches took 119 wickets for less than 16 runs each--and scored 723 runs with an average of 21.', ""At his best Vogler reached the highest class as a bowler. Delivering the off-break with a leg-break action, while depending chiefly upon the leg-break, he became exceptionally difficult and deceptive by the skill with which he used the reverse break and his variations of pace. Scarcely any batsman claimed that he could detect differences in Vogler's delivery of either the googly or the leg-break.

Without detracting in any way from his ability as a player it is as a manager of South African teams to Australia in 1952-53 and 1963-64 and to England in 1955 that he is likely to be most remembered. The prospects of the South African team which went to Australia in 1952 could not have been gloomier from every point of view. Many in both countries felt that the tour should be cancelled to avoid such inevitable and crushing defeats as to do irreparable harm to the immediate future of the game in South Africa. In the event, and thanks largely to the remarkable leadership combination of the captain, Jack Cheetham. and the manager a wonderful team spirit was created. Ken Vilioen's quiet determination, an insistence on the right sort of discipline, and their combined appreciation of the value of fielding laid the foundations of a success beyond anyone's wildest dreams. The Australian tour wisely led to the same combination bringing the team to England in 1955. Again, understanding and discipline of the same kind brought success. Perhavs less dramatic than in Australia, but equally encouraging as far as South African cricket was concerned. The same should be said of the South African tour to Australia in 196364 when, with Trevor Goddard as captain. Ken Vilioen again followed his, by then familiar. principles which I firmly believe did so much to ensure South Africa's preeminence in the cricket world over the next decade.  As a batsman, Ken Vilioen reflected his characteristics as a man-full of courage and quiet, yet fierce, determination. A good onside player and cutter with a sound defensive technique and, unlike many batsmen today. he played well off the back foot. He enjoyed a satisfactory Test match career lasting from 1930 to 1949, and also two very successful tours out of the three he made to England. That he could be stylish, too, was made plain to me when he made 201 against Sussex in 1947 in under four hours-an innings which I enjoyed watching (?) from the closest possible vantage point. Ken Viljoen's cricket career was properly rewarded by the presidency of the South African Cricket-Association.

His early century drought might suggest otherwise, but he is a man for long innings, a man who seems to love to bat on and on. His first century arrived in Bangladesh, in his tenth Test, and he made it a big one, falling five short of a double. He scored two more in the series in India immediately after.

Prioritising IPL over international cricket has led to differences with the board, while injuries have also limited his Test appearances, but as a limited-overs player Bravo remains a key member for West Indies and took over from Darren Sammy as ODI captain in 2013. He held the post till December 2014, when the selectors replaced him with Jason Holder and left him out of the ODI side, two months after he had played a central role in the team pulling out mid-way from a tour to India due to issues with the payment structure in their revised contracts.  \n"", ""As a player, Bravo's skills and self-confidence at the big stage were never in doubt right from the early days in his international career. He made his Test debut at Lord's in July 2004, and took three wickets in the first innings with his medium-paced swingers. He also showed a cool enough temperament to forge a confident start at the crease with the bat. By the end of the series, it was clear that Bravo was a special talent. He scored plenty of runs and claimed a bunch of wickets in four Tests, but nowhere was his ability more evident than in Manchester, where he top-scored for the team, and then restricted England with a six-wicket haul. He hit 107 against South Africa in April 2004-05 at Antigua to bring up his maiden century and in November 2005, scored a magnificent 113 against Australia at Hobart. He dazzled in the ODI series against India in May 2006, bamboozling the batsmen with his slower ones and chipping in with match-winning contributions with the bat. He grew as a player in the limited-overs format in the 2006-07 season with a fluent unbeaten 112, his maiden ODI ton, against England in the Champions Trophy and achieved his best career figures, 4 for 39, against India in the last game before the World Cup. He was often a rare glimmer of joy among some depressing moments until an ankle injury struck in 2008 and ruled him out for eight months. "", ""Around that time, his value as a Twenty20 player came into focus, and with several such leagues coming - most prominently the IPL - Bravo chose those commitments over the West Indians ones. In 2010, he, along with Kieron Pollard, turned down a WICB central contract which would require him to be available to play for West Indies at all times. Next year, he chose the IPL over a two-Test home series against Pakistan. Between 2011 and 2013, West Indies played 24 Tests but Bravo didn't play any of them. He retired from Test cricket in January 2015."", 'On the other hand, he became a fixture in the Chennai Super Kings line-up in the IPLs: in the 2013 season, he led the wickets tally with 32.

Unpredictable or what. You never knew quite what excitement there would be in the next half-hour. Like carbon-dating, the reference to a kids' TV puppet show slots the first-class career of Keith Boyce into a time frame. It began in 1964 in his native Barbados and finally came to a close one June day in 1977 when he was forced out of the game he worshipped by a knee condition that left this marvellous, natural athlete hobbling arthritically for the rest of his life. \n"", ""In 13 years, he had taken 852 wickets - 60 of them in 21 Test matches for West Indies but the vast bulk of them for his county home-from-home, Essex- with lithe, explosive pace bowling, and scored 8800 biff-bang-wallop runs at around 22 per innings. By some distance he bowled better than he batted: he was capable, though, of batting better than he did. His throwing arm was a cannon. `We all backed up when Boycey had the ball,' Fletcher remembers. `Specially if Tonker was keeping,' he adds wistfully. As a limited-overs cricketer Boyce was supreme at that time: the first to the 100-wicket/1000-run double in the John Player League, and figures of 8 for 26 against Lancashire, still a Sunday record."", ""The knee injury, legacy of the strain placed on the joints by years of revving the Boyce of sharing in the spoils to which his career was a precursor. Initially under the sergeant-major leadership of Brian `Tonker' Taylor, and then as part of Keith Fletcher's small group of mad-cap renegades, he was a keystone in the foundations of the modern Essex. Given decent fitness, he might reasonably have played on into the early 1980s and shared in the triumphs. Instead, by 1979, when the county won its very first trophies, he was back home in Barbados, pining for the game."", ""In the five years from the start of 1971, he saw his country through difficult transitional times too. He played in home series against India. Australia and England as well as touring India, Pakistan, Australia and England twice - in 1973, when he had a brilliant series with the ball, and 1975, when he helped West Indies lift the inaugural World Cup. But it was only a few months after that, in the gloomy aftermath of the 5-1 drubbing inflicted by Ian Chappell's side, that Clive Lloyd vowed that never again would West Indies suffer such indignity, and called up the war machine. Roberts and Holding were already in place, Daniel, Garner, Croft, Marshall followed, and after the last of those defeats, at Melbourne, Boyce represented his region no more. His private life was frequently in turmoil - benefit money came and went, and so eventually did his marriage. His Caribbean home blew away in a hurricane and his drinking, never understated, became heavy. But sometimes the Caribbean looks after his own, and his life regained some purpose with a job running the Barbados Cricket Association lottery and coaching youngsters. His affair with the bottle ended, but on his 53rd birthday, he collapsed and died of a suspected heart attack."", ""It was happenstance that brought Boyce from Bridgetown's Empire club to Essex. In early 1965, aged 21, he was chosen, as a leg-spinner, for Barbados against the Cavaliers, an English touring side that included Trevor Bailey, then Essex secretary, and the young Fletcher. With Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith on Test duty, he was instructed to bowl fast instead. Bailey liked what he saw, brought him to England, and set him up in digs on Leytonstone High Road, opposite Fletcher. Boyce spent much of his two-year qualification encased in an army greatcoat which, with the collar turned up, reached from his boots to beyond the top of his head."", ' Boyce loved Essex and Essex reciprocated the affection. He bowled fast with undimmed enthusiasm from the day he started to the day he finished. That half-an-hour of batting could change a game: an hour could win it. In a nice juxtaposition, he joined Fletcher as one of ', ""'s Cricketers of the Year in 1974, after taking 19 wickets in three matches against England the previous summer. By that time, he had long since established himself as an enforcer for Essex, ahead of his time maybe. The game then, says Fletcher, was tough but somehow gentler. If a tailender got stuck in then generally he was applauded. Against Essex, though, that changed. Twenty minutes' defiance at the crease was enough for Taylor's ruddy features to redden further before his patience ran out with the steam from his ears. `I've `ad enough,' he would growl. `Come and'ave a bowl, KD. `It these gloves, son.' And Keith David Boyce, complying, would bounce the crap out of you."", '\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1974'],21.0,30,3,657.0,95*,24.33,,,0,4,,5,5.0,0.0,8.0,4,0,57.0,34,14.25,77,74.02,0,0,5,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,285.0,420,27,8800,147*,22.39,,,4,46,,,215.0,0.0,164.0,142,6,2395,123,17.61,,,1,7,,,44.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21.0,39,3501,1801,60.0,6/77,11/147,30.01,3.08,58.3,3,2,1,8.0,8,470,313,13.0,4/50,4/50,24.07,3.99,36.1,1,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,285.0,,44474,21324,852,9/61,,25.02,2.87,52.1,,35,7,164.0,,7833,4304,268,8/26,8/26,16.05,3.29,29.2,10,3,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

The parents of the child born in Diego Martin, Trinidad, almost seventy years before, may in their highest ambitions have hoped that he would play cricket for the West Indies. They cannot have dreamt that he would take a major share in lifting his people to a new level of respect within the British Commonwealth; that along the way he would become the finest fieldsman and one of the most exciting allrounders the game of cricket has known: and that he would die Baron Constantine, of Marvel in Trinidad and Tobago, and of Nelson, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, a former Cabinet Minister and High Commissioner of his native Trinidad. \n', 'Learie - or ""Connie"" to 40 years of cricketers - came upon his historic cue as a man of his age, reflecting and helping to shape it. He made his mark in the only way a poor West Indian boy of his time could do, by playing cricket of ability and character. He went on to argue the rights of the coloured peoples with such an effect as only a man who had won public affection by games-playing could have done in the Britain of that period.', ""Learie Constantine was the son of Lebrun Constantine, a plantation foreman who toured England as an allrounder with the West Indian cricketers of 1900 - when he scored the first century for a West Indies team in England - and 1906. In 1923 they both played for Trinidad against British Guiana at Georgetown, one of the few instances of a father and son appearing together in a first-class match; both of them long cherished the occasion. In constant family practice the father insisted on a high standard of fielding which was to prove the foundation of his son's success."", ""The younger Constantine had played only three first-class matches before he was chosen for Austin's 1923 team to England when he distinguished himself largely - indeed, almost solely - by his brilliance at cover point. On that visit he learnt much that he never forgot, by no means all of it about cricket: and he recognised the game as his only possible ladder to the kind of life he wanted."", 'As C.L.R. James has written ""he revolted against the revolting contrast between his first-class status as a cricketer and his third-class status as a man."" That, almost equally with his enthusiasm for the game, prompted the five years of unremitting practice after which, in 1928, he came to England under Karl Nunes on West Indies\' first Test tour as an extremely lively fast bowler, hard-hitting batsman and outstanding fieldsman in any position.', 'Muscular but lithe, stocky but long armed, he bowled with a bounding run, a high, smooth action and considerable pace. His batting, which depended considerably upon eye, was sometimes unorthodox to the point of spontaneous invention: but on his day it was virtually impossible to bowl at him. In the deep he picked up while going like a sprinter and threw with explosive accuracy; close to the wicket he was fearless and quick; wherever he was posted he amazed everyone by his speed and certainty in making catches which seemed far beyond reach. His movement was so joyously fluid and, at need, acrobatic that he might have been made of springs and rubber.', 'Although he did little in the Tests of that summer he performed the double and in public esteem was quite the most successful member of the party. He provided splendid cricketing entertainment. Everyone who ever watched him will recall with delight his particular parlour trick - when a ball from him was played into the field he would turn and walk back towards his mark: the fieldsman would throw the ball at his back, ""Connie"" would keep walking and, without appearing to look, turn his arm and catch the ball between his shoulder blades; no one, so far as can be ascertained, ever saw him miss.', ""Crowds recognised and enjoyed him as a cricketer of adventure: but the reports alone of a single match established him in the imagination of thousands who had never seen him play. At Lord's, in June, Middlesex made 352 for six and West Indies, for whom only Constantine, with 86, made more than 30, were 122 behind on the first innings. When Middlesex batted again, Constantine took seven for 57 - six for 11 in his second spell. West Indies wanting 259 to win were 121 for five when Constantine came in to score 103 out of 133 - with two 6's, twelve 4's and a return drive that broke Jack Hearne's finger so badly that he did not play again that season - in an hour, to win the match by three wickets. Lord's erupted: and next day all cricketing England accepted a new major figure."", 'That performance confirmed the obvious, that Constantine was, as he knew he needed to be, the ideal league professional - surely the finest of all. He wanted a part-time living adequate for him to study law. England was the only place, and cricket his only means, of doing both. His batting could win a match in an hour; his bowling in a couple of overs, his catching in a few scattered moments. This was the kind of cricket nearest his heart: and he expressed himself through it. No man ever played cricket for a living - as Constantine needed to do more desperately than most professional cricketers - with greater gusto. Any club in the Lancashire leagues would have been grateful to sign him. Nelson did so with immense satisfaction on both sides. Constantine drew and delighted crowds - and won matches: Nelson won the Lancashire League eight times in his ten seasons there - an unparalleled sequence - and broke the ground attendance record at every ground in the competition. Less spectacularly, he coached and guided the younger players with true sympathy. Among the people of Nelson, many of whom had never seen a black man before, ""Connie"" and his wife, Norma, settled to a happy existence which they remembered with nostalgia to the end. In 1963 the Freedom of the Borough of Nelson was bestowed on the man who then was Sir Learie Constantine.', 'Because of his League engagements he played little more than a hundred first-class matches, in which he scored 4,451 runs at 24.32, and took 424 wickets at 20.60. In eighteen Tests between 1928 and 1939 his overall figures were poor - 641 runs at 19.42; 58 wickets at 30.10. On the other hand he virtually won two important Tests and shaped a third. At Georgetown, in 1930, when West Indies beat England for the first time, George Headley made a major batting contribution; but it was Constantine who twice broke the English batting with four for 35 and five for 87, figures not approached by any other bowler in the match. At Port of Spain in 1934-35 he levelled the series - which West Indies eventually won by one match - when, after scoring 90 and 31, he took two for 41 and ended his second innings three for 11 (in 14.5 overs) with the master stroke of having as great a resister as Maurice Leyland lbw with only one ball of the match remaining. In his last Test, at The Oval in 1939, when he was 37 years old, his five for 73 took West Indies to a first-innings lead.', 'As he grew older he grew more astute. As his pace dropped - though he was always likely to surprise with a faster ball or deal a yorker of high speed - he developed a superbly concealed slower ball; and at need he was an effective slow bowler with wrist or finger spin. He continued to play in charity matches well through his fifties when he could still make vivid strokes, bowl out good batsmen and take spectacular catches.', 'In his younger days some thought him bouncy or unduly colour conscious; if that were so, Nelson warmed him. It would have been strange if so dynamic and effective a cricketer had not bubbled over with confidence. Certainly, though, he gave unhesitating and helpful counsel, and generous praise to his amateur colleagues in the Nelson team. Meanwhile he fought discrimination against his people with a dignity firm but free of acrimony.', 'Half Learie Constantine\'s life was spent in England and, although his doctors had long before advised him that a lung condition endangered his life if he did not return to the warmer climate of the West Indies, he died in London. He remained in England during the Second World War as a Ministry of Labour welfare officer with West Indian workers. In 1944 he fought one of the historic cases against colour prejudice when he won damages from The Imperial Hotel in London for ""failing to receive and lodge him"".', ""He was deeply moved - and never forgot it - when the other players - all white-skinned - elected him captain of the Dominions team that beat England in the magnificent celebratory, end-of-war match at Lord's in 1946. He rose to the occasion in a fine forcing partnership with Keith Miller and his shrewd captaincy decided a narrow issue with only minutes to spare."", 'By then, however, his serious cricketing days were drawing to an end. He did occasional writing and broadcasting. Among his books are ', '(with Denzil Batchelor), and ', "". Years of dogged study were rewarded when he was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1954. Returning to Trinidad he was elected an M.P. in his country's first democratic parliament; became Minister of Works in the government and subsequently High Commissioner for Trinidad and Tobago in London from 1962 until 1964. He was awarded the M.B.E. in 1945; knighted in 1962; made an honorary Master of the Bench in 1963; and created a life peer in 1969. He served various periods as a governor of the B.B.C., a Rector of St. Andrews, a member of the Race Relations Board and the Sports Council."", 'A devout Roman Catholic, of easy humour and essential patience, he lived a contented domestic life with his wife and his daughter. His outlook was that of a compassionate radical and he maintained his high moral standards unswervingly.', ""To the end of his days he recalled with joy the great moments of his cricket and the friends he had made.

His sprint to the crease is reminiscent of Malcolm Marshall's, but, unlike Marshall, his open-chested deliveries seem to limit his ability to move the ball away from the right-hander. His misfortune has been the plague of modern fast bowlers: stress fractures. Yet he is a determined man, who recovered from back injuries when critics had written him off at the end of West Indies' tour of England in 2000, and thus fulfilled his promise to be back in the game. He took four wickets on his return to the one-day side in Zimbabwe in 2001, as West Indies beat India in the final of the Coca-Cola Cup, and after a moderately successful World Cup in 2003, he was recalled to the Test team for the home series against Sri Lanka.

He shared the new ball with younger speed merchants, and though he put the ball in the right place, his inability to put fear in the hearts of batsmen meant that he was expensive and ineffective on the tour to England. Against India at home in 2006, however, Collymore pegged away all through the series, providing a valuable tourniquet at one end. He was way ahead of the other fast bowlers in terms of his economy-rate (2.33) and always appeared capable of taking a wicket. His spell on the first morning at Antigua floored India and, despite not looking fully fit, maintained his accuracy throughout. He played only eight international games in the 2006-07 season and averaged over 30 but just ahead of the selection for World Cup he rocked Jamaica with a six-for in the Carib series. He failed to carry that form into the tournament itself but still found himself briefly in the top 10 of the ICC Test rankings. In 2008, he replaced Ryan Harris at Sussex, joining the club as a Kolpak and he performed with distinction on the south coast before moving to Middlesex at the end of the 2010 season. \n']",[],30.0,52,27,197.0,16*,7.88,642,30.68,0,0,19,0,6.0,0.0,84.0,35,17,104.0,13*,5.77,261,39.84,0,0,5,2,12.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,167.0,223,103,913,23,7.60,,,0,0,,,49.0,0.0,143.0,55,29,156,13*,6.00,,,0,0,,,22.0,0.0,6.0,2,1,5,4,5.00,11,45.45,0,0,0,0,4.0,0.0,30.0,53,6337,3004,93.0,7/57,11/134,32.3,2.84,68.1,3,4,1,84.0,80,4074,2924,83.0,5/51,5/51,35.22,4.30,49.0,1,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,167.0,,28315,13214,492,7/57,,26.85,2.80,57.5,,12,2,143.0,,6564,4744,149,5/27,5/27,31.83,4.33,44.0,1,2,0,6.0,5,95,133,3,1/21,1/21,44.33,8.40,31.6,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Collins was a keen footballer before he fell into cricket, and his left-arm bowling follows the lineage of Bernard Julien and Garry Sobers, and he finds enough swing into the right-hander to cause the best batsmen difficulty. In November 1998 he took three wickets in 11 balls for West Indies A against India, a spell which led to his Test debut against Australia the following March. For a long time after that, he was best remembered for an injury of the cruellest kind, when a Jason Gillespie delivery trapped a testicle outside his box. He worked on his fitness, though, and he returned to the side in 2001-02, with a higher arm action and an extra yard of pace. He took just nine wickets in West Indies' series victory over India, but claimed the prize scalp of Sachin Tendulkar on three occasions. He struggled on India's flat pitches, though, before terrorising Bangladesh in 2002-03. What followed was a less-than-enchanting outing against Australia, and Collins didn't play for close to a year. But he returned to take on England in March 2004, and within six balls, removed Michael Vaughan, before taking three more wickets, to herald a successful return to the side. After a spell out of the side which saw him miss the World Cup and the 2007 tour of England, he was recalled to the West Indies squad for the Twenty20 World Championship and soon after he signed a two-year deal with Surrey as a Kolpak player. His international career was further thrown into doubt when he pulled out of the subsequent series against Sri Lanka in order to fulfil his county contract. \n"", ' March 2008 \n']",['First-class debut: 1997 v Guyana at Bridgetown'],32.0,47,7,235.0,24,5.87,701,33.52,0,0,30,0,7.0,0.0,30.0,12,5,30.0,10*,4.28,50,60.00,0,0,1,0,8.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,148.0,188,54,871,25,6.50,,,0,0,,,31.0,0.0,98.0,39,12,166,55*,6.14,,,0,1,,,17.0,0.0,29.0,5,3,3,1*,1.50,8,37.50,0,0,0,0,3.0,0.0,32.0,61,6964,3671,106.0,6/53,9/117,34.63,3.16,65.6,7,3,0,30.0,30,1577,1212,39.0,5/43,5/43,31.07,4.61,40.4,0,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,148.0,,25317,13033,501,6/24,,26.01,3.08,50.5,,13,0,98.0,,4717,3444,149,7/11,7/11,23.11,4.38,31.6,3,2,0,29.0,29,598,777,26,3/13,3/13,29.88,7.79,23.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He would have been 45 on December 11. Three weeks earlier, he had been one of the hundreds of cricketers saying their final goodbyes at Marshall's funeral. The day before, the startling news had been received of Hunte's passing. Clarke's wife, Peggy, reported he had\ncomplained of feeling unwell and had seen the doctor in the preceding week. But he had played for his club, Crusaders, up until a month earlier and there was no indication that his life was in jeopardy. \n"", 'A strong, powerfully built fast bowler with a typically West Indian love of life and the game he made his profession, Clarke was restricted to 11 Tests by the simultaneous presence of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner, Colin\nCroft and Malcolm Marshall and his decision to join the West Indian teams that broke the international boycott against the apartheid of South Africa in the mid-1980s.', 'Yet there was a host of players in England, where he spent nine productive seasons with Surrey between 1979 and 1988, who rate him as clinically fearsome as any of his contemporary West Indian colleagues. Those who played with and against him in South Africa, where he also represented Transvaal, Northern Transvaal and Orange Free State, speak in similar awe of his ability to generate\nfrightening pace and steep lift from a relatively short, ambling approach and an ungainly, front-on delivery.', ""His secret was his immense strength and a snappy, pliable wrist that he used with telling effect. Like so many Barbadian Test players, Clarke came through the ranks of the BCL that has efficiently organised the game in the country areas for more than 60 years. A return of 21 wickets in his debut season for Barbados in 1978 included a hat-trick against Trinidad and a summons to the West Indies team for the Third Test of the home series against Australia after those contracted to Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket - in other words most of the team - withdrew. In the absence of Roberts, Holding, Garner et al, he spearheaded the weakened attack on the subsequent tour of India where his 21 wickets in five Tests - including Sunil Gavaskar five times - made\nhim the leading wicket-taker. His 5 for 126 at Bangalore remained his\nbest Test figures. He toured Pakistan in 1980-81 when Holding was injured and Roberts rested, and Australia in 1981-82 when Marshall was getting over a back\nproblem. But he saw little prospect of getting back on a permanent basis and\njoined others in a similar position on Lawrence Rowe's unauthorised and\nofficially ostracised teams to South Africa in 1982-84. It was a venture that ended his cricket in the West Indies, for the players were all banned by the West Indies Cricket Board of Control."", ""While Clarke's Test record, spread over four years and four series, is\nunflattering with 42 wickets at an average of 27.85, the true measure of\nhis effectiveness is better judged by his returns in England and South Africa. In the nine seasons he spent with Surrey (he missed 1985 with a back injury)\nClarke gathered 591 wickets at the miserly rate of 18.99 runs each. His best\nyear was 1982 when he took 85 wickets at just under 20 each and helped them\nto the Benson and Hedges Cup. In South Africa, his 193 wickets, at just over 20 each, included a new Currie Cup championship record haul of 58 wickets in 1985 at the astonishing average of 12.72 runs each. In his 238 first-class matches, he took 942 wickets at 19.52 runs each, including three hat-tricks - a statistic not matched by many others."", 'Barbadians and West Indians rarely saw him at his best. He played only one Test in the Caribbean, his first at Bourda, and had only 20 matches for Barbados (68 wickets at 27.91 each). Clarke had the uncompromising approach to batting typical of lower-order fast bowlers. He smashed an unbeaten 35 off 30 balls against Pakistan in the Second Test at Faisalabad in 1981 and his only first-class century, an even, unbeaten 100 for Surrey against Glamorgan a\nfew months later, took him just over an hour and was the quickest of the English season.', 'It was in Pakistan that he was involved in an unfortunate incident in the final Test at Multan that brought him a two-match suspension for the subsequent home series against England. Showered with a volley of oranges and other missiles from the crowd, he reacted by tossing back a brick, used as a boundary marker. It struck and seriously injured a student leader in the stand.', 'At the end of his professional career he returned home to Barbados where he\ncontinued to play in the BCL for his club, Crusaders, alongside his close friend and former Barbados and West Indies colleague, Collis King, until the time of his death.\n']",['Walter Lawrence Trophy 1981'],11.0,16,5,172.0,35*,15.63,,,0,0,,8,2.0,0.0,10.0,8,2,60.0,20,10.0,58,103.44,0,0,3,3,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,238.0,265,44,3269,100*,14.79,,,1,5,,,146.0,0.0,250.0,146,31,1278,45*,11.11,,,0,0,,,66.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,19,2477,1170,42.0,5/126,6/41,27.85,2.83,58.9,3,1,0,10.0,10,524,245,13.0,3/22,3/22,18.84,2.80,40.3,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,238.0,,43564,18397,942,8/62,,19.52,2.53,46.2,,59,10,250.0,,12872,6833,364,6/31,6/31,18.77,3.18,35.3,10,6,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He had the traumatic experience of being given out lbw to Ken Cranston for 99 in the second innings on debut, a misfortune that reportedly reduced him - and, no doubt, most of Guyana - to tears.', ""Invariably down the order at No. 6 or No. 7 in a team whose middle order was dominated by Weekes and the other two Ws, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott, Christiani played in all but one Test on three subsequent tours. His only Test hundred, 107 at Delhi on the 1948-49 tour of India, was actually made at No.8 in a total of 631. It was the first by a Guyanese in Tests.\nLike everyone else, he struggled against the pace of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller on lively pitches in Australia in 1951-52 but he had the satisfaction of securing West Indies' lone victory, at Adelaide on Christmas Day, in an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 92 with Gerry Gomez. He was into his 30s by then and played only six more Tests."", 'Christiani was a true allrounder. He was an outstanding fielder, a fair off-spinner and a wicketkeeper good enough to make two stumpings in the Calcutta Test in 1948-49 when substituting for the injured Walcott. He also represented British Guiana as hockey forward and football goalkeeper.', ""After his playing days, he helped Walcott organise cricket on the sugar estates that brought to the fore a host of new players, including Rohan Kanhai, Joe Solomon and Basil Butcher. He subsequently emigrated to Canada where he worked at Toronto City Hall, spending the last years of his life suffering from Alzheimer's disease.\n"", 'CHRISTIANI, ROBERT JULIAN, who died in Toronto on January 4, 2005, aged 84, was one of West Indies\' best and most attractive batsmen of the immediate post-war era, but found himself overshadowed when the three Ws broke into the side. A correct, bespectacled right-hander who could also keep wicket and bowl serviceable off-spin, Christiani came from a prominent cricket family. His eldest brother Cyril kept wicket in four Tests against England in 1934-35 before dying young of malaria, and two other brothers also played for British Guiana. Even as a teenager, Robert was considered unlucky to miss the 1939 tour of England, but after the war a career-best 181 against Jamaica cemented his place against Gubby Allen\'s England in 1947-48. ""Sugarfoot"" Christiani marked his debut with 99, before being trapped lbw by Ken Cranston (and bursting into tears back in the dressing-room). He did reach a century the following year, against India at Delhi, with 107 - the first Test hundred by a Guyanese batsman - after going in at No. 8. This was a recurring problem: the presence of the three Ws often forced him lower in the order than his strokeplay warranted. ""He played all the shots and was not the least bit inhibited by bowling,"" said his West Indian team-mate Andy Ganteaume. Christiani played in all four Tests on West Indies\' coming-of-age tour in England in 1950, scoring consistently, and acting as reserve wicketkeeper to Clyde Walcott. He was equally solid during the less successful tour of Australia in 1951-52, scoring 76 at Sydney and hitting the winning run - halfway through Christmas Day - as West Indies turned the tables in the Third Test at Adelaide. But he played only four more Tests after that trip, and retired after England\'s 1953-54 tour. He emigrated to Canada, and worked at Toronto City Hall.

He never seemed to play in the V, or off the front foot, but used soft hands, canny deflections, and a whiplash pull-shot to maintain a Test average of over 50. While the cricket world was obsessed with Brian Lara's unquestionable talent, Chanderpaul showed that there were alternate ways to be consistent and prolific in Test cricket over a long period of time, becoming only the second West Indian to score 10,000 Test runs. \n"", 'When Chanderpaul started out, he had a couple of problems: first, a low conversion rate of around one hundred to every ten fifties, and secondly, his physical frailty, widely thought to be hypochondria. That myth was exploded when a large piece of floating bone was removed from his foot late in 2000, and, suitably liberated, he set about rectifying his hundreds problem, scoring three in four Tests against India in 2001-02, and two more in the home series against Australia the following year, including 104 as West Indies successfully chased a world-record 418 for victory in the final Test in Antigua.

', ""Perhaps his greatest contribution, though, had been in holding together West Indies' fragile batting line-up after Lara's retirement. With a couple of other senior batsmen, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chris Gayle, not being available due to various reasons, Chanderpaul's contributions were immense, as he has defied bowling attacks in all countries and all conditions, often with minimal support from the other end. One of the best examples of that was against Australia in 2012, in the series in which he got to 10,000 Test runs: he ran up scores of 103*, 12, 94, 68 and 69, for an aggregate of 346 in five innings.

Spotted in the nets by Brian Lara, he was called up for his Test debut after just one match for Barbados, and promptly took five wickets against Sri Lanka in Jamaica in June 2003. He added five in his first overseas Test, and six in his first one-day international. With a round-arm action not unlike Jeff Thomson's, which has left him vulnerable to back strains, he was more of a protégé of his neighbour Corey Collymore than his half-brother Pedro Collins. He bowls fast, can swing the ball and get reverse swing, but insists that he does not go for out-and-out pace.  \n"", ""Despite regular chances at Test level, however, he rarely showed enough control to be a match-winner and the selectors blew as hot and cold as did his bowling.  They did draft him into the squad to tour England in 2007. He bowled well in the Chester-le-Street Test but was fined for swearing too loudly, and an unproductive series in South Africa followed. He lost his spot for the first Test against Sri Lanka, was recalled in Trinidad and grabbed five wickets to help West Indies draw the series. At one-day level he was given a long run in 2006 but axed towards the end of the year after failing to shine at the Champions Trophy. Edwards was not needed at the World Cup but, on his ODI recall, he blasted through England with 5 for 45 at Lord's."", ""He reached a personal milestone in the second Test against New Zealand at Napier on West Indies' 2008-09 tour, taking 7 for 87 - his career-best figures - to pass 100 Test dismissals. Settling into the role of senior bowler in the West Indies side, he bowled aggressively without much reward on England's tour of West Indies in early 2009, and was particularly venomous towards Kevin Pietersen and James Anderson. But arguably his most important performances in the series came with the bat, as he and Daren Powell clung on for 60 balls to secure a draw in the third Test in Antigua. Edwards was at it again in the fifth Test in Trinidad, surviving a tense finale to secure the Wisden Trophy for the first time since 2000."", ""But just as Edwards began to find the consistency that had long eluded him, he picked up another back injury in the course of West Indies' campaign at the World Twenty20 in England in June 2009. He returned to Barbados and was put on a remedial programme, but abandoned it to represent Deccan Chargers in the Champions League later that year. He picked up another injury in the course of that tournament, and was ruled out of West Indies' tour of Australia - perhaps a relief as the depleted side failed to win a single game. The last of his 55 Tests came against Bangladesh in Khulna in 2012."", 'Hampshire benefited from his presence in 2015. By picking up 45 Championship wickets at 20.8 from eight matches, he was the prime force in their First Division survival, taking 10 wickets in a first-class match for only the second in his career as Hampshire crucially beat Nottinghamshire in the last match to avoid relegation. A broken ankle suffered in a pre-match warm-up at Headingley wrecked his 2016 season as Hampshire only escaped relegation because Durham were demoted after a financial bale-out, but a useful season a year later again helped Hampshire escape on the final day.

He is remembered best for his blazing performance at Perth in 1975-76, when he raced to one of the most astonishing of all Test centuries. This series was eventually won 5-1 by Australia, with Lillee and Thomson at full pelt. But in the second Test, on an incredibly fast WACA pitch, Fredericks took them on in amazing fashion. The harder they banged the ball in, the harder he cut and hooked. Into the second morning, he opened what might have been a diffident reply to Australia\'s 329: at lunch West Indies were 130 for on off 14 eight-ball overs; the 200 came up in the 22nd. Fredericks went on to reach a hundred from 71 balls and, though he grew tired, turned it into a match-winning 169. This was merely a distillation of his entire career. ""There has,"" as Mike Selvey wrote, ""probably never been a better or more willing exponent of the hook."" His most famous single shot was a failure, however: right at the start of the first World Cup final, he hooked a ball from Lillee over long-leg - only to tread on his wicket in the process. \n', 'A small (about 5ft 6in) left-hander from Berbice, Fredericks made his debut for what was then British Guyana in 1963-64, and for nine years and 59 Tests = from 1968-69 until the World Series schism of 1977 - he provided half the answer to the conundrum of who should open for West Indies. This had been intractable even when Conrad Hunte was playing, and remained a source of constant change and argument until Gordon Greenidge emerged to join Fredericks in the mid-9170s. He preferred to tilt his cap back, rock on to his left foot and smash the ball hard, but he was capable of playing as a traditional opener. When West Indies first brought him in, for the 1968 Boxing Day Test at Melbourne after Clive Lloyd was injured, he batted throughout a slightly shortened, bitterly cold opening day while the rest of the batting collapsed around him. With 76 and 47 he emerged with distinction from a drab performance.', ""This was a period of steep but brief West Indies decline and, though it took him a while to perform as well against Fredericks became an in important brick in the rebuilding process. He scored three fifties in six innings when West Indies lost a series to England (for the last time until 2000) in 1969 but did not score a century until February 1972 against New Zealand at Sabina Park, when his 163 was overshadowed by the double-century from debutant Lawrence Rose. They put on 269. At Edgbaston in 1973, he scored 150 in patient mode - taking eight hours and surviving a crisis when he was completely bogged down against Ray Illingworth - and a cautious 138 to ensure the draw when West Indies were unexpectedly up against it in the Lord's Test of 1976. A month later at Headingley, he returned to the attack, scoring 79 before lunch and reaching 109 in 156 minutes. However, even then he was just doing an opener's job: on that day everyone else really cut loose and West Indies had 437 by the close. Though he scored eight Test hundreds in his 109 innings, this was a low ratio for a player who averaged above 40 - he preferred the blistering fifty."", 'Fredericks averaged 63.83 for Guyana. In his three years with Glamorgan (1971-73), he was less consistent but spasmodically magnificent and extremely popular - not least with his opening partner Alan Jones, even though Jones described his calling as ""terrible"" and suffered from his musical tastes when they roomed together. On an amazing day at Swansea, they put on 330 against Northamptonshire, at the time a record for any Glamorgan wicket; they still lost. Fredericks announced his retirement for Guyana, batted twice, and scored 103 against Trinidad & Tobago and 217 against Jamaica. It was an astonishing way to finish. By then, he was already a junior minister in Forbes Burnham\'s left-wing Guyanese government, responsible for youth and sport, and known as Comrade; earlier in his playing days he had generally endeared himself by calling everyone ""old chap"". He remained attached to the government, but later concentrated on coaching. By then, openers around the world were batting in anonymous helmets. Fredericks was one of the last players who not only relished facing the best bowlers but looked as though he did.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1974'],59.0,109,7,4334.0,169,42.49,,,8,26,,8,62.0,0.0,12.0,12,0,311.0,105,25.91,440,70.68,1,1,,,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,223.0,391,34,16384,250,45.89,,,40,80,,,177.0,0.0,68.0,68,0,1644,119,24.17,,,2,9,,,33.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59.0,43,1187,548,7.0,1/12,1/12,78.28,2.77,169.5,0,0,0,12.0,1,10,10,2.0,2/10,2/10,5.0,6.00,5.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,223.0,,5532,2846,75,4/36,,37.94,3.08,73.7,,0,0,68.0,,178,116,7,3/5,3/5,16.57,3.91,25.4,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Griffith, the last survivor of those mentioned, died in Bridgetown in March at an age, 86, which helps defy the belief, held by so many fast bowlers themselves, that the vigorous pursuit of their youthful days on the cricket field shortens life. \n', ""Not that Herman Griffith of Barbados was irresponsibly a tearaway type. C. L. R.\nJames, who saw so much of him and revered him, wrote that Griffith 'had his field set and he bowled to it. He was as strong as a horse, he always bowled well within himself, and he would wait on the batsman to give him an opening.'"", 'From this it may be deduced that Griffith - who made his name with the\nfamed Empire club - was not of top speed. But he was. It was simply that his career was long, and he was 34 before he played his first Test match. He missed the 1923 tour of England because of the territory quota system, George Francis being preferred.  Griffith and Francis together, however, shook the 1925-26 MCC team when they went down by an innings to Barbados. They took nine wickets each.', ""West Indies disappointed on the 1928 tour, losing a dozen matches, including all\nthree Tests by an innings, but Griffith was an outstanding success, bowling fast, with late swing either way, and taking 76 wickets (only Constantine took more: 107), his 11 at 22.72 being well ahead of any of the others in the Tests. Six of those wickets came in the third Test, at The Oval, five of them, all top\nEngland batsmen - Tyldesley, Hammond, Leyland, Hendren and Chapman - in the\nspace of an hour with the new ball. This remains one of the most distinguished\n'lightning strikes' in Test history. Griffith's tour record would have been even better but for the awful shortcomings of the close catching; how today's brilliant West Indian slip fielding would have lifted him. He annihilated Northumberland, Durham, Minor Counties and Cahn's XI, and against stiffer opposition outside the Tests, his greatest distinctions came against Yorkshire\n(6 for 46 at Sheffield) and Kent (11 for 118 in the match at Canterbury).

Earlier in the series Griffith took 5 for 63 and 3 for 99 in the Trinidad Test, but finished on the losing side."", ""A moment that lives in history came during the 1930-31 tour of Australia, when\nGriffith administered to Don Bradman his first Test duck. West Indies had had a hard time of it, being thrashed in the four earlier Tests. The pitch at Sydney, however, suited them better, particularly in the fourth innings, when it was awkward after rain. Grant's declaration challenged Australia to make 251 for victory, and Woodfull and Ponsford put up 49 for the first wicket. Bradman's downfall, described vividly by Learie Constantine in Cricket and 1, came\nafter a skilful, teasing series of deliveries from Griffith, and demoralised the\nAustralians.

In an emergency, at  Georgetown in  1964-65, he even umpired a  Test match. He made his name as a batsman, scoring 161 not out for  Trinidad against  Jamaica when he was still a teenager, and earning selection for the  1939 tour of  England, though his achievements there did not match his promise. By the time  West Indies resumed Test cricket almost nine years later he was senior enough to take over the captaincy for one match, but - as all white  West Indians were to find - his place in the team was being challenged by the emergence of new talent.  Gomez adapted: he dropped down the order, provided dogged counterpoint to the genius of the three Ws and developed into a gifted swing bowler. From quiet beginnings, he matured enough to take seven for 55 at  Sydney in  1951-52. He still played important innings, including his only Test century in  West Indies' first match against  India, at Delhi in  1948-49, but usually he was either in a supporting role or - as happened regularly in  Australia - in charge of repairs.  Gomez captained the team on only the one occasion; his compatriot and contemporary  Jeff Stollmeyer overtook him. But his leadership qualities came through later. When he was appointed manager for the  1960-61 tour of  Australia, C. L. R. James said it was  a brilliant selection - Gerry is popular at home and in  Australia, knowledgable and tough. The tour was a triumph and  Gomez was an important behind-the-scenes influence in ensuring harmony. He was a longstanding member of the West Indies Board, and president for 30 years of the West Indies Cricket Umpires' Association, which he welded together.  Gomez played football for Trinidad, and became a vice-president of the country's football and tennis associations, an executive member of the Olympic Association, president of the Boy Scouts' movement and chairman of the annual music festival. He was a holder of Trinidad's Humming Bird Medal (Gold), for services to sport.

The image of a bowler of genuinely high pace stricken with Parkinson\'s disease is a dolorous one, but such was Roy Gilchrist\'s fate. Following his brief but dramatic Test career, he had lived in England for many years, marrying and, not always in peaceful accord, rearing seven children before returning to the West Indies in 1985. He was accorded a ready welcome, but he was troubled by his health and by persistent hard times. His childhood on a sugar plantation had been impoverished and rough, and, in Michael Manley\'s sympathetic analysis, he was ""burdened by those tensions which so often run like scars across the landscape of the personalities of people who come from poverty"". \n', 'Certainly he was awkward to manage, insufferably so at times, and his Test career came to a precipitate termination in 1958-59 when his hard-pressed captain, Gerry Alexander, with the support of the senior players, dispatched ""Gilly"" home from India before the Pakistan leg of West Indies\' tour of the subcontinent. Constant friction with Alexander off the field, coupled with over-aggressive bowling on it, including the unacceptable use of the beamer, was the cause. Banished from the international scene, he found professional slots in England, where he had toured in 1957 with mixed fortune. He played in the Lancashire leagues for a variety of clubs, including Middleton (for whom he took a total of 280 wickets in 1958 and 1959), going on to take 100 wickets every year until 1979. However, tales of atrocity, some perhaps arising from the proverbial tendency to give a dog a bad name, continued to emerge about his violently over-reactive attitude to batsmen and his unsparing use of the bouncer. Even charity matches were not free from his ferocious assaults: on one such occasion, at Werneth, that resolute Australian Cec Pepper luridly but successfully remonstrated with Gilchrist in terms not suitable to print.', ""Gilchrist's venomous bowling was the expression of a fiery, hostile personality.

Roy Gilchrist played only five times for Jamaica, between 1956-57 and 1961-62, and he also had six games for Indian sides in 1962-63, when a number of West Indians were recruited to harden Indian batsmen to pace bowling.\n""]",[],13.0,14,3,60.0,12,5.45,,,0,0,,,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,42.0,43,10,258,43*,7.81,,,0,0,,,10.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13.0,23,3227,1521,57.0,6/55,9/73,26.68,2.82,56.6,5,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,42.0,,8391,4342,167,6/16,,26.00,3.10,50.2,,7,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

But a lack of respect, for opposition bowlers at least, has served Gayle well since then. Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers. And in this era of Twenty20 cricket, Gayle is the batsman who has thrived like no other. \n', ""Among his many strengths, perhaps the biggest one is his outstanding hand-eye coordination, which allows Gayle to regularly hit even good-length deliveries for boundaries. Technique and footwork aren't his greatest assets, but most often he compensates with other skills. No batsman has taken to the 20-over format like he has. He showed early signs of his liking for that format by smashing the first century in Twenty20 internationals - a 57-ball 117 against South Africa in the World Twenty20 in 2007 - and when Twenty20 leagues mushroomed the world over and sought international stars, Gayle was the biggest beneficiary. "", 'Over two seasons - 2011 and 2012 - of the IPL, he became easily the most feared batsman of the league, smashing more hundreds and sixes than any other batsman, by far. When he carted Pune Warriors all over the ground to score an unbeaten 175 in IPL 2013, it felt right that he should finally own the record for highest individual score, fastest century, and most sixes in a Twenty20 innings, because no batsman has dominated Twenty20 cricket like he has. ', ""Gayle's free-stroking, aggressive style is obviously best suited for limited-overs cricket, but that doesn't mean he hasn't cut it as a Test batsman. When he has turned up for West Indies, his pugnacious approach has become an attacking weapon in its own right, in what's been a lean era for West Indian cricket. His 79-ball century at Cape Town in January 2004, on the back of a South African first innings of 532, was typical of his no-holds-barred approach. However, Gayle has also shown the ability to bat long periods and the hunger to make big scores. In 2009 against Australia, Gayle batted almost seven-and-a-half hours in scoring an unbeaten 165 to save the Test in Adelaide; in the very next game, though, he smashed the fifth-fastest Test century - off 70 balls - to indicate that quick-scoring remained his preferred method. Next year he batted almost ten hours and scored 333 against Sri Lanka and Muralitharan in Galle, becoming only the fourth batsman to score two triples in Tests, thus proving again his ability to bat long periods."", ""And then there is also his brisk non-turning offspin, with which he has turned himself into a genuine allrounder in limited-overs cricket. His tendency to stay aloof on the field sometimes suggests he isn't interested in the proceedings, but his relaxed approached was good for the team whenever he led West Indies. However, West Indies have missed his services far too often due his differences with their board. During his exile, he was a Twenty20 regular in various leagues around the world, entertaining crowds in Australia, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. After a long spell out from international cricket he returned strongly in 2012 on the tour of England and subsequently at home against New Zealand.""]",[],103.0,182,11,7214.0,333,42.18,11970,60.26,15,37,1046,98,96.0,0.0,289.0,283,17,10151.0,215,38.16,11649,87.14,25,51,1093,314,120.0,0.0,58.0,54,4,1627.0,117,32.54,1139,142.84,2,13,138,105,15.0,0.0,180.0,321,26,13226,333,44.83,,,32,64,,,158.0,0.0,361.0,354,24,12860,215,38.96,,,29,67,,,150.0,0.0,371.0,363,47,12318,175*,38.98,8374,147.09,21,76,942,907,87.0,0.0,103.0,104,7109,3120,73.0,5/34,6/81,42.73,2.63,97.3,2,2,0,289.0,195,7334,5846,165.0,5/46,5/46,35.43,4.78,44.4,3,1,0,58.0,23,319,377,17.0,2/15,2/15,22.17,7.09,18.7,0,0,0,180.0,,12511,5194,132,5/34,,39.34,2.49,94.7,,2,0,361.0,,9610,7300,227,5/46,5/46,32.15,4.55,42.3,4,1,0,371.0,131,1945,2479,80,4/22,4/22,30.98,7.64,24.3,2,0,0,False,True,False,True

If his value in Test cricket was as an integral part of the most formidable pace attacks ever - they spread the load so that he took five wickets in an innings on just seven occasions - then in one-day cricket, particularly in the overs at the end of an innings, when the unhittable yorker speared in relentlessly, he was priceless.

It wasn't until his fourth coming as an international cricketer that he really made his mark, with back-to-back centuries against the mighty Australians. All of a sudden, his phlegmatic approach became a vital counterpoint to a rejunevated Brian Lara at the other end. But his form fell away and he was dropped after the first Test against South Africa in April 2004-05. Recalled for the 2005-06 tour to New Zealand, he was the second highest run scorer in the three-Test fixture. He looked good for a third hundred - and West Indies for a rare victory - in the first Test at Auckland, but a rash stroke on 95 ruined all that and Ganga was in for flack from his critics. Indifferent innings at Wellington and Napier notwithstanding, he was retained for the series against India later that season. It proved to be a benchmark of sorts, and Ganga clearly had taken a mature step forward. His total of 344 runs in four Tests was a team high by some margin, and his 135 and unbeaten 66 in the drawn third Test in St Kitts were innings of confidence and composure.  He cemented his place with back-to-back 80s in Pakistan. Touring England as the vice-captain, Ganga's position was soon elevated following Ramnaresh Sarwan's injury. Ganga, however, failed to shine with the bat and was dropped for the Natwest Series that followed. Even after being named as Trinidad & Tobago's cricketer of the year, Ganga failed to find a place in the squad for the ICC World Twenty20 and the tour of Zimbabwe before making a return to the squad for the the tour of South Africa that followed. However he had six poor innings in South Africa and was not picked by the selectors for the rest of 2008 and the majority of 2009. He continued to lead Trinidad and Tobago, and their victory in the Stanford 20/20 won them a berth in the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 in India, where Ganga's stock went up when he guided his team to the final.\n"", ' October 2009\n \n']",[],48.0,86,2,2160.0,135,25.71,5556,38.87,3,9,284,2,30.0,0.0,35.0,34,1,843.0,71,25.54,1414,59.61,0,9,69,7,11.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,26.0,26,26.00,31,83.87,0,0,3,1,0.0,0.0,172.0,302,29,10137,265,37.13,,,23,48,,,112.0,0.0,109.0,108,13,2810,101*,29.57,,,2,20,,,36.0,0.0,40.0,31,5,518,62*,19.92,476,108.82,0,1,27,19,14.0,0.0,48.0,8,186,106,1.0,1/20,1/20,106.0,3.41,186.0,0,0,0,35.0,1,1,4,0.0,-,-,32.91,24.00,-,0,0,0,1.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,172.0,,622,334,4,1/7,,83.50,3.22,155.5,,0,0,109.0,,301,193,5,2/20,2/20,38.60,3.84,60.2,0,0,0,40.0,1,6,18,0,-,-,-,18.00,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

May 9, 1932, Greenland Plantation, Shorey's Village, St Andrew, Barbados ","December 3, 1999, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia (aged 67 years 208 days) ",,"['West Indies,', 'Barbados']",,,,,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,Administrator,,,"['\nSir Conrad Cleophas Hunte died of a heart attack after playing tennis in Sydney on December 3, 1999, aged 67.  Conrad Hunte was one of the greatest West Indian batsmen of a great generation; he also played a major role in the reconstruction of South African cricket, and was a figure of moral authority in the wider world. As a batsman,  Hunte could match anyone stroke-for-stroke, especially on the  leg side, if he wanted. But he subdued his attacking nature in Test cricket to let his team-mates play their shots, a decision which was vital in making the West Indian side of the early 1960s one of the most complete of all time. It was an early signal of the determined thoughtfulness that was to stamp his whole life. \n', ""Hunte was born in a one-room house on Barbados's Atlantic coast. His father worked on a sugar plantation, and Conrad was the oldest of nine children. He began playing cricket with the village boys at the age of six, using a palm-frond as a bat. His father was more anxious that he should get an education, and prevailed enough to ensure that his teenage son got work as a primary school teacher. But cricket slowly won the contest. Batting first in a representative match between two local leagues at Kensington Oval in  1950-51,  Hunte was dropped on nought by Denis Atkinson, and went on to 137 not out. That secured him a place in the  Barbados team when he was just 18, and he made 63 on debut against  Trinidad. However, there was little first-class cricket in the Caribbean at that time, and his progress was frustratingly slow. He made 151 and 95 for  Barbados in the important matches against E. W. Swanton's XI in  1955-56, and hoped that would get him selected for the 1957 tour of England. In the meantime he went to work at a bus plant and cotton mill in Lancashire, trying to get a chance in the Leagues. Out of sight, out of mind, he was omitted in 1957 - allegedly because he never replied to a letter - and spent that summer playing for Enfield."", 'He finally got his chance in front of his home crowd, when  Pakistan toured the  West Indies early the following year, and batted throughout his first day in Test cricket, making 142. Two Tests later at  Kingston,  Hunte made 260 - an innings overshadowed because his partner in a stand of 446 was  Garry Sobers, who scored his record 365 not out - and followed that with a third century, a mere 114, in his fourth match, at  Georgetown. Since  Sobers made twin centuries, he was again second fiddle. Such form could not last, and he struggled in the subcontinent in 1958-59.  My success had gone to my head, he admitted later. When the tour reached  Pakistan, he was dropped. But, for all their strengths,  West Indies were short of opening batsmen; indeed, throughout his Test career,  Hunte never had a settled opening partner. Also, his class was not in doubt, and by  Australia in 1960-61 he was a fixture, making the crucial throw in the Tied Test that stopped  Wally Grout scoring the winning run, and then hitting 110 at  Melbourne.', 'The cricket on that tour, however, was secondary to the real change in his life. The captain,  Frank Worrell, encouraged the players to build good relations locally, and  Hunte impressed many people with the eloquence of his speeches. A local journalist, James Coulter, took him to see a film called The Crowning Experience, based on the life of the black American teacher Mary McLeod Bethune. This was promoted by Moral Re-Armament, the then-vogueish organisation which strives to provide an ethical basis for society. In England, on the way back home, he went to see Dickie Dodds, the former  Essex batsman and dedicated MRA man.  Hunte was taken to a conference in Switzerland, and resolved to pay back £10 he had cheated on his tour expenses three years earlier, and to live his life by new standards:  absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness, absolute love. Henceforth, between cricket commitments, he travelled on behalf of MRA.', ""Hunte came to  England in 1963 as  Frank Worrell's vice-captain, and he took the decision, with the same certainty that he declared for MRA, to curb his attacking instincts and become the team's sheet-anchor. He began the series at  Old Trafford with one match-winning innings, 182, and finished it at  The Oval with another, 108 not out. When  Worrell retired,  Hunte hoped for and expected the captaincy.  Sobers was appointed instead; there was speculation that  Hunte's heart-on-sleeve nature and his continuous proselytising for his beliefs even within the dressing-room told against him. He wrestled with his bitterness and his conscience for six weeks before waking up a rather bemused  Sobers in his hotel room to proclaim that he would keep playing, and do his utmost. He did: though he failed to make a century in the next series, home to  Australia in  1964-65,  Hunte topped the Test averages with 550 runs at 61.11. He made another  Old Trafford hundred at the start of the  1966 series, and his eighth and last Test century in  Bombay that December, batting with the debutant  Clive Lloyd. His final Test average, just above 45 in 44 Tests, was a mark of his quality."", ""Some sources give  Hunte the credit for persuading his team-mates to stick with the tour in  India after a riot in  Calcutta, though it is uncertain how much the team listened to him by then. He was in the habit of leaving notes around the dressing-room containing uplifting messages:  It was tiresome for some of the boys, said  Sobers. Even  Hunte's mentor Dickie Dodds admits there might have been a problem:  They certainly pulled his leg. But I think he was the conscience of the team, and his moral force gave the whole side an ethos. After retiring from cricket,  Hunte worked for better race relations through an MRA inter-racial group, and travelled the world before settling in Atlanta, where his wife Patricia was a TV newsreader. In 1991, as South Africa inched towards change, he rang Ali Bacher and pleaded to be allowed to help the reconciliation process. He kept phoning, then arrived and stayed for seven years, quietly funded by MCC, with the title National Development Coach. The emphasis was on motivating and inspiring young people in the townships. He was a magnificent influence. However, shortly before he died,  Hunte had returned to Barbados, with encouragement from the Government, which knighted him in 1998. There he won a fiercely contested election to became President of the Barbados Cricket Association, with a mandate to revive it. There was talk of him standing for the presidency of the West Indies Cricket Board. Amid all this, he remained deeply committed to the cause of his life, and was due to speak at an Australian MRA conference when he died.  I've never met a better person, said Bacher, who worked with him all through the South African years.  I never heard him speak ill of anyone.\n"", ""West Indies cricket sustained another disabling blow with the sudden death of Sir Conrad Hunte on December 3, aged 67. He succumbed to a heart attack while playing tennis with friends in Sydney, Australia, where he had gone as keynote speaker at a conference of Moral Re-Armament (MRA) to which he had committed his life since 1961 when: during West Indies' tour of Australia, he saw a film on\nthe Christian-based movement in Melbourne. In desperate need of strong, visionary leadership from the committed and respected greats of the past, the\ngame in the Caribbean lost two men capable of providing it in the space of\na month. One Saturday afternoon, Hunte was acting as one of the pallbearers at Malcolm Marshall's funeral; three weeks later, he himself had passed on."", 'Less than two months earlier, Sir Conrad had been elected president of\nthe Barbados Cricket Association (BCA), a prelude to what surely\nwould have been evenwider involvement in the game. Hunte was the consummate, and only stable, opener of the powerful West Indies team of the 1960s, quick of eye, nimble of footwork and precise in judgement of length and line. Even without the benefit of a consistent partner he accumulated 3,245 runs at an average of 45.06 in his 44 Tests. Hunte took 13 different batsmen to start the innings with him\nduring the 10 years of his Test career, skilfully compromising his attacking instincts to be an effective and essential counter to the flamboyant stroke-makers who followed him, like Garry Sobers, Rohan Kanhai and Seymour\nNurse. His success could be measured as much by the fact that his eight hundreds were spread around four continents against every opponent he came up against as by his impressive statistics. Even they do not attest to his additional asset as a fast, sure-handed cover fielder with a powerful, flat throw that famously ran out Wally Grout from deep midwicket as he scrambled for the third run that\nwould have won Australia the tied Test in 1960.', ""As West Indies vice-captain for eight years, Hunte was a loyal lieutenant, first to Frank Worrell, for whom he held a hallowed regard, then, on Worrell's retirement, to Sobers. He admitted subsequently that he was so gravely hurt to have been passed over for the leadership in favour of Sobers, reportedly on\nWorrell's advice, that he considered quitting. True to his Christian values, he soon dismissed his disappointment and remained a stabilising influence to the tactically more impetuous new captain."", ""Hunte came late to Test cricket. Like so many West Indian cricketers, he was born into a large, poor family, the eldest of nine children whose father worked on a sugar plantation in St Andrew on the rugged east coast of Barbados. Also like so many before him, his talent was nurtured through the Barbados Cricket League (BCL), the efficiently administered competition for the island's\nneglected country areas. By the time he gained his first Test cap in 1958, aged 26, he had already played for Barbados for eight years and was widely regarded as the best opener"", ""His impact was immediate. He took 142 off Pakistan in his debut innings, on his home ground of Kensington Oval, Barbados, and almost doubled that in the Third Test of the series with 260, the significance of which was overshadowed by an even more monumental innings by his partner in a record second-wicket partnership. After Hunte was run out to end the stand at 446, Sobers went on to his unbeaten 365, surpassing Len Hutton's mark as Test cricket's highest Test score."", ""Athletically trim to the end and, in his heyday, physically fit, he was\nnowhere near past his best when he chose to give up the game and devote his\nlife to MRA in 1968. Quick-witted fans immediately gave a new interpretation\nto MRA-'More Runs Available'. He transferred from London in the late 1970s\nand lived for 12 years in Atlanta, USA, where, in addition to his MRA\nmission, he worked in independent financial services and was Barbados'\nHonorary Consul. It was there he met and married Patricia, an American who\nwas a noted television personality. The couple had three daughters."", ""Cricket blood, however, coursed through his veins and, as the walls of apartheid began to crumble with the release of Nelson Mandela from Robben Island and cricket administration in South Africa came under a united board, Hunte recognised a new and urgent mission. He called the chief executive officer, Dr Ali Bacher, in Johannesburg and offered his services. Accepted, he spent seven years there, concentrating on developing the previously disregarded talent in the black townships and, under the sponsorship of an MCC programme, touring the rest of Africa, spreading the gospel of cricket and, inevitably, of Jesus Christ. He was even made manager of the South Africa women's team to England in 1997."", ""But his homeland eventually needed him too. His services to cricket were recognised in 1998 when he was awarded Barbados' highest honour, the Order of St\nAndrew, yet the game that had been an all-embracing way of life a to his countrymen was losing its  place in the psyche of the youth. Concerned about the decline, Prime Minister Owen Arthur sought out Hunte in South Africa\nand encouraged him to return to apply his experience and expertise in helping to revive interest and standards. He was attached to the Ministry of Education and Youth Affairs and became immersed in his task."", 'It was no surprise that he could be persuaded to seek the presidency of the BCA nor that he was duly elected. He was full of ideas and energy. He could see\nclearly where Barbados and West Indies cricket should be heading, and how it should get there, as the 21st century dawned. Ironically, it may have been all\ntoo much for a heart that a doctor in South Africa had alreadydetected was in need of a rest.', 'Ever generous with his advice and cheerful in his outlook, he leaves memories of a happy cricketer and an enlightened man of the world whose love of the game, and of his country, was surpassed only by his love of God.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1964'],44.0,78,6,3245.0,260,45.06,,,8,13,,,16.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,132.0,222,19,8916,263,43.92,,,16,51,,,68.0,1.0,3.0,3,0,12,11,4.00,,,0,0,,,3.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44.0,8,270,110,2.0,1/17,1/17,55.0,2.44,135.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,132.0,,1353,644,17,3/5,,37.88,2.85,79.5,,0,0,3.0,,115,61,6,4/38,4/38,10.16,3.18,19.1,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

The world eventually got to know why the boy from Barbados was rated so highly when he became the first player, in 534 first-class matches, to score a hundred in each innings at Headingley. \n', "" \nHope was 23 at the time, the youngest member of the XI, leading West Indies to victory with scores of 147 and 118 not out. They had been faced with a target of 322 - not since Bradman's Invincibles rocketed to 404 for 3 in 1948 had a team chased that many on Yorkshire's storied turf, and won.

 ","['\n', ""George Alphonso Headley MBE, who died in Jamaica on November 30, 1983, aged 74, was the first of the great black batsmen to emerge from the West Indies. Between the wars, when the  West Indies batting was often vulnerable and impulsive,  Headley's scoring feats led to his being dubbed  the black Bradman. His devoted admirers responded by calling  Bradman the white Headley - a pardonable exaggeration.  \n"", ""In 22 Tests, when the innings could stand or fall on his performance,  Headley scored 2190 runs, including 10 centuries - eight against England - with an average of 60.83. He was the first to score a hundred in each innings of a Test at  Lord's, in  1939, and it was a measure of his ability that from 1929 to 1939 he did not have a single bad Test series. By the start of the Second World War he had totalled 9532 runs in first-class cricket with an average of 72.21. Afterwards, though not the power that he had been, he extended his aggregate to 9921 runs, with 33 centuries and an average of 69.86."", 'Born in Panama, where his father had helped to build the Canal, Headley was taken to Jamaica at the age of 10 to perfect his English - Spanish had been his first tongue - and to prepare to study dentistry in America. At school he fell in love with cricket, but he might still have been lost to the game had there not been a delay in getting his passport for the United States. While he was waiting,  Headley was chosen to play against a visiting English team captained by the  Hon. LH Tennyson. Though not yet 19, he had innings of 78 in the first match and 211 in the second, and dentistry lost a student. Surprisingly he was not chosen for the 1928 tour of  England immediately afterwards, but in the home series against  England in 1929-30 he scored 703 runs in eight Test innings, averaging 87.80. His scores included 21 and 176 in his first Test, 114 and 112 in the third and 223 in the fourth. In 1930-31 in  Australia he scored two more Test centuries and ended the tour with 1066 runs. ', ""Clarrie Grimmett described Headley as the strongest on-side player he had ever bowled against. In 1932, in a single month, he hit 344 not out (his highest-ever score), 84, 155 not out and 140 against another English side to visit  Jamaica. Against sterner opposition and in more difficult conditions in England in the following year, he averaged 66 for the tour, scoring a century on his first appearance at  Lord's and taking 224 not out off  Somerset. In the second Test, in  Manchester, he made 169 not out, a score he improved upon with 270 not out in  Kingston in the  1934-35 series. "", 'Headley was of medium build, compact, balanced and light on his feet. Like most great batsmen he was a superb back-foot player and seldom made a hurried shot.  Sir Leonard Hutton, who saw him at his best in  1939, declared he had never seen a batsman play the ball later. It was hard to set a field for him, such was his genius for collecting runs with his precise placement of the ball. ', 'Headley also excelled in league cricket in  England. At every level of the game, in fact, he scored an avalanche of runs with a style and brilliance few of any age have matched. His contribution to the strength and power of modern  West Indies teams cannot be exaggerated.

It was not a clever move. Harper took one stride to his right, his right arm telescoped and plucked the ball cleanly from the turf. In the same flowing movement he threw down Gooch's middle stump with the batsman upended on all fours. Harper was not a great offspinner - he suffered in later years from the yips - and little more than an adequate hard-hitting batsman. But his fielding was fabulous. After retirement he went into coaching, taking charge of West Indies between 2000 and 2003 during a period of transition.  He was appointed as the U-19 coach in December 2005, but quit after a month to take charge of the Kenyan national side where he rebuilt a squad that was close to a shambles when he arrived.

Muscular and tall (6ft 2ins) with a classical action, Hall presented a fearsome sight. A long, lithe approach ended with a fast and well-aimed delivery.

He took the new ball, six wickets, and never looked back. He toured England in 1957 with only one first-class game to his name, but he struggled for form and with his run-up and looked unimpressive.  Called into the side to tour India and Pakistan in 1958-59, he took 46 wickets in eight Tests, and he was a regular thereafter. In the classic Tied Test on 1961 at Brisbane he took 9 for 203, and bowled the last over with six runs were needed for victory with three wickets left. He took one wicket, dropped a crucial catch, and there were two run-outs.  Against India in 1961-62 he grabbed 27 wickets at 15.74 and in 1963, partnered by Charlie Griffith, he blasted England into defeat. At Lord's, in another epic finish, he bowled unchanged for three-and-a-half hours and took 4 for 93 (as well as breaking Colin Cowdrey's arm).  In 1964-65 his 16 wickets were instrumental in guiding West Indies to their first series win over Australia, but by the time he toured England in 1966 the signs were there that he was on the wane.  He retired, along with his partner Griffith, at the end of the tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1968-69.

Consider some of the\nillustrious names in the West Indies side in the 22-year-old's first Test in\n1957 against England at Edgbaston: Sonny Ramadhin, Clyde Walcott, Everton\nWeekes, Garfield Sobers and Frank Worrell. Ten years later he was playing\nwith Charlie Griffith, Wes Hall and Lance Gibbs. At the end of his Test\ncareer he was lining up with Roy Fredericks, Alvin Kallicharran, Clive\nLloyd, Vanburn Holder and Andy Roberts. And during his time in England with\nWarwickshire he was at the heart of an excellent batting line-up: John\nJameson, Dennis Amiss, Kallicharran and MJK Smith formed the top five\nbatsman with Kanhai. \n"", 'For Warwickshire Kanhai scored 1,000 runs in a season on ten occasions,\nhis most prolific year being 1970 when he hit 1,894 at an average of 57.39.\nHe also hit 1,000 runs in a season once in Australia and once while touring\nIndia and Pakistan. His highest score for Warwickshire was 253 against\nNottinghamshire in 1968 at Trent Bridge. Kanhai and Jameson created a\nfirst-class world record with an unbroken stand of 465 for the second wicket\nfor Warwickshire against Gloucestershire at Edgbaston in 1974; Jameson made\n240 and Kanhai 213.', 'Born at Port Mourant on British Guyana, Kanhai played for the country from\n1954-55 until 1973-74. In his early days he was a wicketkeeper as well as a\npugnacious middle-order batsman; indeed, in his first three Tests he kept\nwicket before Franz Alexander took over behind the stumps. Kanhai deputised\nas keeper on several other occasions.', ""But it was his batting which West Indies came to rely on for more than 16\nyears. He didn't score a century until his 13th Test but it was worth\nwaiting for; he smashed 256 runs off the Indian attack at Calcutta. There\nwere centuries too for Sobers and Basil Butcher as West Indies crushed their\nhosts by an innings and 336 runs. Kanhai followed this with 99 in the next\nTest as West Indies went on to win the series 3-0. Another double century\nfollowed on the same overseas tour, this time in Lahore as West Indies beat\nPakistan by an innings. In all he hit 15 Test centuries, averaging 47.53 in\nTest matches."", 'Kanhai was appointed captain of the West Indies for the home series\nagainst Australia in 1972-73. West Indies lost the five-Test series 2-0 but\nhe retained the captaincy for the tour to England the following summer. This\ntime he enjoyed success, winning the three-Test series 2-0, although the\nfollowing winter he only managed to draw the five-Test home series against\nEngland 1-1. Unhappy with his own form, he retired from Test cricket after\nthat series.', ""One-day cricket was in its infancy as Kanhai's career drew to a close,\nand he only played in seven ODIs. However, he went out on a high, appearing in the first World Cup Final at Lord's in 1975 against Australia.

The following winter he toured India (his first eight Tests were against them) again only standing out once. In fact, his first ten innings contained one hundred, one fifty, and eight scores of 13 or less - and four ducks.  He played once against Australia in 1983-84, making a superb 97 in front of his home crowd, a performance which won him a place on the 1984 England tour. He didn\'t appear in any of the Tests, but made 585 runs at 73.12 nevertheless.  Two mediocre series home and away to New Zealand followed, but he finally found consistency in India, his chanceless hundred at Calcutta the highlight.  Thereafter he was a more regular contributor, although there were still poor patches, most notably against Pakistan and Australia,  but in England in 1988 he topped the averages with 364 runs at 72.80, winning the Man of the Match at Lord\'s for his 81 and 95*.   However, his next visit to England was less successful and brought the curtain down on his Test career.  Logie remained loyal to his third-division club side, Texaco-Brighton, arguing that nobody wanted to know him when he was a nobody, and as he had started, there he would finish there.   After retiring in 1993, he moved into coaching, taking charge of Canada and then guided West Indies to their triumph in the 2004 Champions Trophy. But despite that, it was a difficult time for West Indies cricket and Logie\'s tenure was rarely without criticism and he quit ""by mutual consent"" shortly after returning home.  He then took charge of Bermuda, but inherited a side with deep-rooted problems, not the least being the poor personal discipline of many senior players. After a poor 2007 World Cup and several subsequent setbacks, he stepped down after they failed to qualify for the 2011 tournament, leaving with a stinging yet justified attack of the whole set-up.

A cousin of Lance Gibbs, he was a hard-hitting batsmen and one of the most successful captains in history. An almost ponderous, lazy gait belied the speed and power at his command and the astute tactical brain that led the West Indies to the top of world cricket for two decades. \n', 'Clive Lloyd made his first-class debut as a left-hand middle-order batsman in the then British Guiana in 1963-64 and played for Haslingden in the Lancashire League in 1967. He was offered terms by Warwickshire before signing for Lancashire, making his debut for them in 1968, and winning his cap the following season.', 'Lloyd had already made his Test debut, against India at Mumbai (then Bombay) in December 1966, hitting 82 and 78 not out as he put on 102 runs with Sobers to win the match on a pitch helping the spinners. His first home Test also brought his first Test century, 118 against England in Trinidad that helped stave off defeat. Another century followed in the fourth Test of that series to confirm he was at home at the highest level. Touring Australia in 1968-69 he hit another Test century, at Brisbane, in his first Test against them.', ""Lloyd was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1971 for his performances in the previous 12 months, when he'd scored 1600 runs for Lancashire at 47. Often raising his game for the big occasion, he struck 126 against Warwickshire at Lord's to help Lancashire to the Gillette Cup (1972), and hit a wonderful century in the first ever World Cup Final at Lord's in 1975 to take the West Indies to victory."", 'At his best Lloyd was a flamboyant destroyer of bowling. His heavy bat, powerful shoulders and full swing of the arms could turn the course of any game, once scoring 201* in just 120 minutes against Glamorgan - equalling the record for the fastest ever first-class double hundred (1976).', ""Far from inhibiting his batting, Lloyd's first tour as captain (1974-75) marked a dramatic improvement after a run of low scores. 163 in the First Test at Bangalore (his century came in just 85 balls) was followed by a Test-best 242* in the Fifth Test in Mumbai to set up a series-deciding win for the West Indies. Often he was obliged to curb his natural, attacking instincts in order to work his team out of trouble, as on the tour of Australia of 1975-76 where he scored 469 runs at an average of 46.9 as his team were swept aside 5-1 by Thomson and Lillee."", 'The unsuccessful tour of Australia proved to be a major turning point in West Indian cricket however, as Lloyd decided to adopt the intimidatory tactics of the Australians and stack his team with fast bowlers. Some may say his job as captain was fairly straightforward: with a battery of fast bowlers including Roberts, Marshall, Garner, Holding and Croft at his command, and batsmen of the calibre of Greenidge, Haynes and Richards, he certainly had some handy players to call upon. But he instilled his talented side with the professionalism and determination to win consistently and when the conditions suited the opposition. He united the disparate threads of the separate nations that make up the West Indies, and was the force that gelled them as a team rather than a bunch of talented individuals. There was controversy too, though. Slow over rates and intimidation of batsmen with short-pitched bowling were both characteristics of his reign as captain. His side changed the way Test cricket was played too, as other nations copied the formula of fast bowling and intimidation he had come to admire in Australia.', 'During the Packer crisis Lloyd resigned as captain after disagreeing with the selectors on the eve of a Test against Australia (1977-78), but he returned to lead his team to the 1979 World Cup. On the subsequent tour of Australia he underwent surgery on his knee that improved his mobility and effectiveness. Centuries at Adelaide and Old Trafford followed, and back in the West Indies he found the most consistent form of his career as in nine successive innings his lowest score was 49 (run out). He averaged 76 in the series against England and a phenomenal 172.50 in domestic cricket.', 'Although age slightly decreased Lloyd\'s belligerence at the crease, he remained a key player in the middle order; able to dig the team out of trouble or add impetus when applicable. In Australia in 1981 he played the crucial innings to secure the West Indies a win at Adelaide to draw a series that had seemed destined to be won by Australia, encouraging his fast bowlers to rush on to the pitch and carry him off on their shoulders. Normal service was resumed with home and away victories against India and Australia. On his final tours he averaged 67 in England (1984) as the West Indies completed a famous 5-0 ""blackwash"", and 50.85 against Australia (1984-85) as he helped secure a 3-1 triumph.', ""Lloyd's final record as captain was remarkable, including a run of 26 Tests without defeat, and 11 successive wins. He also became the first West Indian to win 100 Test caps. Having been a schoolboy athletics champion, he became a brilliant cover fielder before knee problems forced a move to the slips, where he pouched many of his 90 Test catches."", 'Lloyd was a useful right-arm medium-pacer too, taking 114 first-class wickets in all (including a best of 4-48, Lancashire v Leicestershire at Old Trafford, 1970) with 10 in Tests. He was awarded a testimonial by Lancashire in 1977 (that raised £27,199) made captain of the club in 1981 and brought his children up in the county.', 'Although Lloyd has worked as a civil servant for Guyana Ministry of Health, he has remained involved in cricket. He has coached and commentated on the game, as well as managing the Guyana team. A promising career as ICC Match Official (he officiated in both semi-final and final of the 1996 World Cup) was put on hold to take on the management of the West Indies team after their disappointments in the World Cup. It was a frustrating period for Lloyd, whose hands were tied by the decision not to appoint him as a full selector (although he was a selector while on tour), and whose responsibilities became increasingly administrative. He resigned at the end of the 1999 tour of New Zealand after a three-year period that coincided with a decline in the fortunes of West Indies cricket.', 'With that experience behind him, he resumed his duties as an ICC Match Referee - a position he occupied with great presence and no little humour to earn the respect and confidence of the players. They knew he understands the game as well as anyone and that he holds the good of the game in the highest regard at all times.

It started when Frank Worrell entrusted the wicketkeeping position in England in 1963 to a diminutive boyish figure, barely out of his teens - and was rewarded with a record 24 victims. Murray's influence on the improved status of cricketers in the Caribbean was immense, and in later life, after retirement, he took that diplomatic role on Trinidad's behalf to the United Nations. His keeping was compact, tidy and, bearing in mind some of his more exuberant successors, generally understated. Nowadays, when more runs are demanded of keepers, he might not have played as much as he did. But his batting was as dapper as his glovework.

Aged 14, he made  745 runs at 126.16, earning him selection for the Trinidad Under-16 team. A year later he was in the West Indies Under-19 side.  In 1990, aged  20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest captain, leading them to victory in the Geddes Grant Shield. In that year he made his Test debut, scoring 44 and 6 against Pakistan. \n"", ""No-one since Bradman has built massive scores as often and as fast as Lara in his pomp. Even his stance was thrilling - the bat raised high in the air, the weight poised on a bent front knee, the eyes low and level. Then the guillotine would fall, sending the ball flashing to the boundary. In the space of two months in 1994, Lara's 375 and 501 not out broke world records for the highest Test and first-class scores, but sudden fame turned him into a confused and contradictory figure. During an inventive but largely fruitless spell as captain of a fading team, Lara reiterated his genius by single-handedly defying the 1998-99 Australian tourists with a sequence of 213, 8, 153 not out and 100. For a while, excess weight and hamstring problems hampered his once-lightning footwork, and the torrent of runs became an occasional spurt. But after Garry Sobers suggested a tweak to his flourishing backlift, Lara returned to his best in Sri Lanka in 2001-02, with 221 and 130 in one Test and 688 runs - a record 42% of West Indies' output - in the series, and reclaimed the captaincy the following year. "", 'The task proved as hard second time round, leading a side where he was far and away the best player and where discipline was a constant worry. He led them to defeat for a second time in South Africa, and then lost to England in the Caribbean, too. But then, just when all hope seemed to have deserted West Indies cricket, Lara responded to the prospect of a home series whitewash with an astonishing unbeaten 400 in the final Test against England in Antigua. In doing so, he became the first man to reclaim the world Test batting record, a feat that ensured he would stand alongside Shane Warne as the most charismatic cricketer of the modern era. ', ""Then followed a spectacular low, when Bangladesh came visiting and had West Indies in trouble in the one-day series and the first Test, prompting Lara to threaten his resignation if his batsmen did not lift their game. They responded in the following game, and Lara captained the side in England, where the team was beaten in every Test they played. Astonishingly, he then galvanised his charges and led the one-day team to victory in the ICC Champions Trophy to spark off hopes of a West Indies resurgence. But it was under Shivnarine Chanderpaul that Lara registered his next big moment - in Adelaide in November 2005, when he went past Allan Border's tally of 11174 runs to become Test cricket's most prolific scorer. Then in April 2006, after protracted dispute between the West Indies board and the players union (WIPA), he was reinstated - for the third time - as West Indies captain. Lara's leadership in the five-match one-day home series against India came in for much praise as the tourists were knocked over 4-1, but in the succeeding Test series he struggled. His captaincy was erratic - inspiring in parts, questionable on many occasions - though he later revealed that his hands were tied due to peripheral issues related to team selection."", 'In Pakistan he led by example with the bat but results continued to go against his side and as West Indies struggled both on and off the field, it became increasingly obvious that Lara was unable to inspire them to greater things, and he appeared increasingly at odds with many of his team-mates. The World Cup offered him a chance to bow out on home soil and on a high, but it was not to be. He showed glimpses of his abilities, but one fifty in seven innings was not enough as West Indies went out with a whimper. He quit, one ODI short of his 300, amid rumours of bitter disputes with administrators. It was a sad, but perhaps inevitable, way for such a genius to bow out.\n', ' April 2007']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1995', 'Honorary Member of the Order of Australia, Nov 2009']",131.0,232,6,11953.0,400*,52.88,19753,60.51,34,48,1559,88,164.0,0.0,299.0,289,32,10405.0,169,40.48,13086,79.51,19,63,,,120.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,261.0,440,13,22156,501*,51.88,,,65,88,,,320.0,0.0,429.0,411,43,14602,169,39.67,,,27,86,,,177.0,0.0,3.0,3,0,99,65,33.00,86,115.11,0,1,11,1,0.0,0.0,131.0,4,60,28,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.80,-,0,0,0,299.0,5,49,61,4.0,2/5,2/5,15.25,7.46,12.2,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,261.0,,514,416,4,1/1,,104.00,4.85,128.5,,0,0,429.0,,130,149,5,2/5,2/5,29.80,6.87,26.0,0,0,0,3.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

 ","['\nMalcolm Marshall slithered to the crease on the angle, pitter-pat feet twinkling as if in dancing shoes. It was reminiscent of a sidewinder on the attack. Purists occasionally criticised his action as too open, but it had method: he maintained mastery of orthodox outswing and inswing from a neutral position without telegraphing his intent. He was lithe, with a wickedly fast arm that elevated him to express status. Only in inches was he lacking - but he even turned that to his advantage with a bouncer as malicious as they come, skidding on to the batsman. Later in his career, he developed a devastating legcutter which he used on dusty pitches. Allied to a massive cricket intelligence, stamina and courage, Marshall had all the toys and he knew how and when to play with them. His strike rate of 46.22 was phenomenal, his average of 20.95 equally so. He may well have been the finest fast bowler of them all. \n', 'He reserved his best figures for England. In 1984, he broke his left thumb while fielding early in the match, but first of all batted one-handed, hitting a boundary and allowing Larry Gomes to complete a century, and then, with his left hand encased in plaster, he shrugged off the pain to take 7 for 53. Four years later, on an Old Trafford wicket prepared specifically for spinners, he adjusted his sights, pitched the ball up, and swung and cut it to such devastating effect that he took 7 for 22. Let that be a lesson, he seemed to be saying, and indeed it was. The whole cricket world mourned his tragically early death, from cancer, at 41.', '\n', '\nMARSHALL, MALCOLM DENZIL, who died of cancer on November 4, 1999, aged 41, was one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time. Even in the formidable line-up of West Indians whose speed and ferocity dominated world cricket for the last quarter of the 20th century, Marshall stood out: he allied sheer pace to consistent excellence for longer than anyone else; he was relentlessly professional and determined; and he was also the best batsman of the group, coming nearer than any recent West Indian to being an allrounder of the quality of Garry Sobers. Though batsmen feared him, he was exceptionally popular among his peers: his death was mourned throughout the cricket world, but his fellow-professionals, who knew him best, were most deeply affected.', 'Marshall was born in St Michael, Barbados. As with Sobers, his triumphs grew out of childhood tragedy: his father was killed in a road accident when he was a baby, and he learned the game from his grandfather as well as at the beach and the playground. He began as a batsman, then discovered his ability to strike back. After playing just one first-class match for Barbados as a 19-year-old, he was taken to India amid the confusion of the World Series schism in the weakened team captained by Alvin Kallicharran. He made his Test debut, aged 20, in December 1978 in Bangalore. Marshall made no immediate impact at that level but showed enough to be taken on by Hampshire as successor to Andy Roberts. He missed part of the 1979 season because of the World Cup. But, with West Indies back to full strength, he could not get on the field for them; on the team picture, standing next to Joel Garner and Colin Croft, he looks an insignificant figure. In county cricket, meanwhile, he did not yet have the firepower to carry a struggling team.', 'However, on the 1980 tour he secured a Test place and at Manchester was instrumental in causing a collapse of seven wickets for 24. It began to be noted that, although not physically imposing - he was 5ft 11in - he had a natural balance and athleticism. Furthermore, he applied himself to his craft. In 1982, he was devastating, taking 134 wickets for Hampshire - a figure no one else touched in county cricket in the last 32 years of the century - and building a reputation as the bowler best avoided by anyone with a sense of self-preservation. Careful observers noted that he also bowled more Championship overs than anyone else. His first really dominant Test performance came at Port-of-Spain the following March, when he took 5 for 37 against India. When West Indies played Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup semi-final at The Oval, he worked up top speed even in a one-day game, and it was obvious - though he was still first-change - that the global fast-bowling crown now rested on his head.', ""And there it stayed. Batsmen agreed that Marshall was hardest of all to face because of the way he used his ordinary height to produce telling rather than exceptional bounce. He was, they said, a skiddy bowler. His outswinger was magnificently controlled. And when he dropped short of a length - he was never shy of doing that - especially from round the wicket, he produced deliveries that were as physically intimidating as anything the game has seen. In 1983-84, he was the prime avenger for the World Cup final defeat by India, taking 33 wickets in a six-Test series which West Indies won 3-0. Less than four months later, he overpowered Australia's batsmen, taking five for 42 when they were 97 all out in Bridgetown, and 5 for 51 in Kingston. But it was at Headingley in July 1984 that he produced his most astonishing performance: on the first day, he broke his left thumb in the field and was assumed to be out of the game. When the ninth West Indian first-innings wicket fell, the England players were about to stroll off. Suddenly, Marshall marched down the dressing-room steps and batted one-handed long enough for Larry Gomes to score a century. Then, with his lower arm encased in pink plaster, Marshall took 7 for 53: bowling first at his normal pace, then swinging the ball in the heavy northern air, throughout showing an indomitable ability to play through pain that in itself helped force England into submission. He recovered from the injury to blast England out with a fusillade of bouncers at The Oval: his seventh five-for in ten Tests, a sequence he took to 11 in 14 a few months later when he took command of the series in Australia."", ""At this point, Marshall was in his unbeatable prime. He set the tone for the 1985-86 series against England by breaking Mike Gatting's nose in a one-day international, just as he had done when he hit Andy Lloyd (who never recovered as a top-level cricketer) at the start of the 1984 series. And he led an assault on the New Zealand batsmen in Kingston in 1984-85 that may well have been the most intimidatory of the lot. No umpire in the world - and certainly none in the West Indies - had the courage to limit properly the number of bouncers."", ""But venom was only part of his armoury. Marshall acquired ringcraft at an early stage: he developed the inswinger and the legcutter. And he became capable of playing vital Test innings as well, at No. 8 or even higher (he made 92 against India in 1983-84, and scored seven first-class centuries) without ever quite losing his fast bowler's relish in batting as a hobby. He produced another commanding performance with the ball in Lahore in 1986-87, and against the England rabble of 1988 took 35 wickets at just 12.65. Five of them came in an hour at Old Trafford where he finished with 7 for 22 and England were 93 all out. He rarely bowled a bouncer in that series; there was no real need. But in the report of the Old Trafford game "", "" noted the progress of the unknown Ambrose at the other end. Batsmen never threatened Marshall's dominance but soon after West Indian bowlers did. He did another blazing match (11 for 89) against India in Port-of-Spain in 1988-89, but more often he was one of the pack, and he played his 81st and final at The Oval in 1991, where Graham Gooch became his 376th Test victim. This remained a West Indian record until Walsh overtook him in 1998-99. But Marshall's average of 20.94 is unsurpassed by any bowler who has taken 200 Test wickets."", ""Marshall continued playing for Hampshire for the next two seasons, and was thrilled to bits when they won the 1992 Benson and Hedges final. He returned to the club as coach in 1996, emphasising that this was not the ordinary businesslike relationship that exists between a county and an overseas pro. He became West Indies' coach that year too, though by the time he was taken ill during the 1999 World Cup, Marshall was inevitably taking his share of the blame for the team's inability to live up to the standards he had himself helped to set. The fact that both his old teams wished to employ him was a testament to the esteem in which he was held. He was diagnosed with cancer of the colon in the spring of 1999. Chemotherapy in England failed, and he went home to Barbados, marrying his girlfriend Connie a few weeks before he died."", 'It was his willingness to work hard at his game that made Malcolm Marshall supreme even in a great generation. He was a relentlessly probing and thoughtful opponent - his Hampshire team-mate Robin Smith said he could nominate the deliveries that would get players out. And, to an extent matched only by the slightly more sedate Walsh, he was willing to produce his best on dull days and dull pitches when other overseas players might lay off the accelerator. After play, he was affable among his fellow pros and polite to all-comers. He was contemptuous of his West Indian contemporaries who went to South Africa to bolster apartheid in 1982-83 but, when the politics changed in the 1990s, he went to play and coach in Natal, where he became as revered as in Southampton or Bridgetown. Across the continents, to a generation of cricketers unused to the death of their friends, the loss of Marshall came as a savage blow. Five West Indian captains were among the pallbearers.']",[],81.0,107,11,1810.0,92,18.85,,,0,10,,18,25.0,0.0,136.0,83,19,955.0,66,14.92,1246,76.64,0,2,,,15.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,408.0,516,73,11004,120*,24.83,,,7,54,,,145.0,0.0,440.0,285,60,3795,77,16.86,,,0,8,,,68.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,81.0,151,17584,7876,376.0,7/22,11/89,20.94,2.68,46.7,19,22,4,136.0,134,7175,4233,157.0,4/18,4/18,26.96,3.53,45.7,6,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,408.0,,74645,31548,1651,8/71,,19.10,2.53,45.2,,85,13,440.0,,22332,12358,521,5/13,5/13,23.71,3.32,42.8,20,4,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He then had to withdraw from the next Test after picking up an injury, but returned for the third Test   and scored 73 in front of his home supporters. Poor performances in the final two matches meant that he missed out on the 1960-61 tour of Australia.  He was recalled to face India in 1961-62, scoring his only Test hundred (125) at Kingston and back-to-back fifties at Port-of-Spain.

His three summers with the club have yielded not too far short of 3,000 first class runs in a style that identified him as one of the more sober, reliable run-makers on the county circuit.  His best season was 2013 when he accumulated five centuries, including 199 not out in a successful run chase against Gloucestershire. The end of that innings was notable with Nash having to retire hurt, with victory 21 runs away, one run short of a double century because of sunstroke after spending more than five hours at the crease. He said he was dizzy and had slightly blurred vision and felt like a boxer on the ropes, liable to be hit at any minute. Kent batsman Brendan Nash says he had no choice but to retire hurt against Gloucestershire on Saturday, despite being a run short of a double century.  \n', ""Born in Western Australia and with a Jamaican father, Nash stamped himself as a first-class player of real promise for Queensland with innings of 157 against South Australia and 96 in the Pura Cup final win over Tasmania in 2001-02. He followed up those contributions the next season with 176 against New South Wales before a form slump disrupted his progress. He fought back to earn Bulls' contract status and was a regular performer without nailing a permanent place. A left-handed batsman, a stunning fielder (he was a Test substitute against West Indies at the Gabba in 2005) and a useful left-arm medium-pacer, he played five Pura Cup games in 2005-06 and picked up the third century of his career with 107 at the WACA. "", 'Small at 173cm, Nash follows in the sporting trail of his father, who was a swimmer for Jamaica at Olympic and Commonwealth Games level from 1966 to 1970. After being used only three times in 2006-07, he was not offered a contract and decided to try his luck in Jamaica. He had a strong first campaign, which finished with him scoring a match-winning century in the Carib Challenge final, and after barely 12 months in the Caribbean he was called into the West Indies squad for the ODI tri-series in Canada. A Test promotion also came quickly and he made 23 on debut in the rain-ruined match against New Zealand in Dunedin before a satisfying double of 74 and 65 in Napier. A central contract soon followed and during the Tests against England in the Caribbean Nash provided a buffer between the powerhouses of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan and a previously fallible lower order. His sensible batting earned him 239 runs, including a maiden Test century.', 'When Nash was appointed vice-captain towards the end of 2010 it looked as though his future was secure. Not so.  A poor run of form saw him dropped after a home Test against India in 2011, however, and a year later he was left to concentrate on forging a county career with Kent.']",[],21.0,33,0,1103.0,114,33.42,2548,43.28,2,8,130,3,6.0,0.0,9.0,7,3,104.0,39*,26.0,141,73.75,0,0,11,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,139.0,229,30,7752,207,38.95,,,18,32,,,50.0,0.0,88.0,66,16,1596,98*,31.92,,,0,8,,,28.0,0.0,8.0,6,1,84,26,16.80,96,87.50,0,0,7,0,1.0,0.0,21.0,14,492,247,2.0,1/21,1/21,123.5,3.01,246.0,0,0,0,9.0,6,294,224,5.0,3/56,3/56,44.8,4.57,58.8,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,139.0,,1657,801,23,2/7,,34.82,2.90,72.0,0,0,0,88.0,,798,562,16,4/20,4/20,35.12,4.22,49.8,1,0,0,8.0,2,24,40,1,1/32,1/32,40.00,10.00,24.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Here was a bowler whose pace came from timing, with power from a huge pair of shoulders. His bouncer was regarded as one of the most dangerous. He varied its pace, often setting batsmen up with a slower one and then poleaxing them when they were late on the quickie. \n"", 'It took Roberts less than two and a half years to reach 100 Test wickets, the quickest at that point, and his best years were unquestionably in the middle 1970s, before the Packer revolution.

K. Nunes, played in West Indies' First Test Match, at Lord's in 1928. In that match, batting in the middle order, he scored 0 ( run out) and 16, but it was in his customary position as an attacking opening batsman that, against England at Barbados in the First Test of 1929-30, he became the first West Indian to score a Test century. His 122, containing twenty fours, was also his maiden first-class hundred, and he followed it with 77 in the second innings.

However, he gave much pleasure to spectators, not least with his brilliant fielding, particularly in the covers. In the other two Tests played that summer, he top-scored for West Indies with 50 at Old Trafford and 53 at The Oval, where he and Challenor got the match under way with 91 in 70 minutes. With C. G. Grant's side in Australia in 1930-31 he scored 637 runs at 24.50 in the first-class matches, but after beginning with 56 at Adelaide he endured a lean run in the Tests until scoring 31 and 34 in the Fifth Test at Sydney, where West Indies gained their first victory over Australia."", ""In England in 1933 he again began unhappily in the Test with a pair at Lord's caught first ball when West Indies followed on, only to recover with 13 and 64 at Old Trafford and 8 and 56 at The Oval, reaching his half-century in just 33 minutes. Against Surrey, earlier in the tour, he had scored 128 before lunch there and gone on to 180 in 170 minutes, his highest innings in a tour aggregate of 1,286 at 25.72. His final Test match was at Barbados against England in 1934-35, when on a pitch drying after rain he scored 9 and 10 not out to take his total runs from 16 matches to 952 with an average of 30.70.

His productive, if brief, Test career as a solid left-handed opening batsman, dependable enough to average 46.18 in his 15 Tests, and his far longer involvement in management that saw him rise to the presidency of the West Indies Cricket Board of Control between 1981 and 1988, coincided with golden eras of West Indies cricket. Yet his administrative roles spanned two of the most contentious issues of the day - the intrusions of Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket in the late 1970s and apartheid-era South Africa in the 1980s. In spite of such challenges, West Indies were never stronger than during his presidency. \n"", ""Even more than most of his contemporaries, cricket was Rae's life. Son of Ernest, who toured England with West Indies in 1928, Rae made an immediate impact on coming into the Jamaica team in 1947, with hundreds in each innings against Barbados in his second match. He was in London, studying law, when England came to the Caribbean for the first Test series after World War II in 1948 and it was from London that he was summoned for his debut tour of India later that year. Over the next two series, he shared an opening partnership with Jeffrey Stollmeyer, by contrast a tall, stylish right-hander, that brought stability to the top of the order for the first time, setting the foundation for the rapacious Three Ws - Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott - to follow."", ""In India, Rae scored hundreds at Bombay and Madras and repeated the feat on the historic tour of England the following year when West Indies triumphed in England for the first time. Rae's 106 at Lord's set the early platform for a signal victory at the game's headquarters; his 109 at The Oval helped secure the series. He could not come to terms with the pace of Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and Bill Johnston on lively pitches on the 1951-52 tour of Australia and played only six more Tests after his zenith in England.\n"", 'RAE, ALLAN FITZROY, who died on February 27, 2005, aged 82, was a lefthanded opening batsman whose century for West Indies at Lord\'s in 1950 helped change the face of cricket. Rae scored a dogged 106 to set the stage for the team\'s strokemakers and spinners who secured one of the game\'s most famous victories. He scored heavily in West Indies\' two subsequent wins, including another hundred at The Oval. ""Rae provided the solidity,"" said Wisden. ""He never allowed himself to take the slightest risk until the innings was shaping satisfactorily, but woe betide the bowler who faltered in length."" Born into the game - his father Ernest toured England in 1928 without playing a Test - he had broken into the side in India 18 months earlier. Rae scored two hundreds, and began his famous opening partnership with Jeff Stollmeyer, which yielded an average of 71 in 13 Tests. But he struggled against Australian pace in 1951-52, and retired from Tests at 30 to become a barrister. He remained heavily involved in the game, becoming president of both the Jamaican and West Indies Cricket Boards, neglecting his practice - so it was said - because of his devotion to cricket. Rae saw earlier than most administrators the need to deal with Kerry Packer, but was resolute against the West Indian players who defected to South Africa. In 2000 he returned to Lord\'s, the scene of his triumph, and recalled how he had refused to change into clean flannels to meet the King for fear of losing concentration.

His wife and son also were injured in the attack. Youngest of six brothers, Stollmeyer was a considerable influence in West Indies cricket, both on and off the field, first during the days when whites controlled the game, and then in the transition to a more democratic process. Tall and graceful with a good range of strokes marked especially by the drive, he made his major impact on the international scene with his solid left-hand opening partner, Allan Rae, providing the base on which Weekes, Worrell and Walcott were to build so effectively on the 1950 tour of England. It was this series, won 3-1, that catapulted West Indies into the top rank of Test teams.', "" Stollmeyer began his Test career a decade earlier when, at the age of eighteen, he toured England in 1939, along with his brother, Victor, making 59 at Lord's in his début innings, the same score at The Oval in the Third Test, and averaging 30.53 for the tour from 916 runs. In 1948-49 he and Rae established West Indies' first reliable opening partnership, putting on 239 against India at Madras. Stollmeyer's 160 was the highest of his four Test centuries. As vice-captain of the team in England in 1950, he played a significant role in its success, averaging 50.83 in the Tests with a top score of 78, and scoring 1,334 runs in all first-class matches, including 198 against Sussex at Hove. He batted almost five and a half hours there, despite a severely bruised hand, and he and Rae (179) established a record for any West Indian wicket in England with their opening stand of 355 in 4 hours 40 minutes. But it was a different story for the West Indians in Australia in 1951-52, brought back to earth largely by the short-pitched bowling of Miller and Lindwall. Stollmeyer made a brave century in the final Test, captaining the side after a disillusioned John Goddard had stood down. He retained the captaincy for the home series against India in 1952-53, England in 1953-54 and Australia in 1954-55; but his captaincy was not as imaginative and aggressive as his strokeplay. The blunter approach of Goddard decided the selectors to bring him back at the age of 38 to lead the 1957 team to England, Stollmeyer, disappointed, chose to retire from first-class cricket. His Test career had brought 2,159 runs at an average of 42.33, while his first-class total was 7,942 runs at 44.61 with fourteen centuries, the highest being 324 at Port-of-Spain for Trinidad against British Guiana in 1946-47. His third-wicket stand with Gerry Gomez of 434 in that match remained a national record at the time of his death. Stollmeyer bowled modest leg-spin, which brought him 55 wickets at 45 runs each, and he held 93 catches."", ""Yet his chief contribution to the game was perhaps in administration, where his courteous nature and principled approach made him a calming influence during difficult days. He worked closely with Gomez in persuading West Indies cricket that the time had come to give black players their proper say, culminating in the appointment of Frank Worrell as captain. Stollmeyer served as a member of the West Indies Board of Control and Test selector before becoming Board president in 1974 - one of the most demanding administrative roles in cricket because of the range of interests, backgrounds and the sheer geographical stretch of the regions and organisations. There was extra tension for Stollmeyer when, in 1977, most current West Indies players joined Packer's World Series Cricket and were given strong support from the cricket public. A traditionalist who feared the impact of outside commercial influence on the game, Stollmeyer demonstrated his strength of character by his continued opposition to WSC. Despite demands that he resign, Stollmeyer's sense of duty inspired him to continue in office, and he rode out the storm. However, he remained unhappy with much of the change WSC had brought, especially in the advance of one-day cricket, which he regarded as not worth watching. He stood down as a Board member in 1981 but remained closely connected with the game, and was regularly consulted by later players and administrators."", 'His 1983 autobiography, ', "", was a simply told but informative, incisive study of the development of cricket in the modern West Indies. In it was the pointed comment that the future of West Indies cricket is linked closely, for several reasons, to the issue of South Africa, given the risk that cricket might split on this point. Stollmeyer's involvement in a wide range of activities stretched to politics - he was a senator in the Trinidad Parliament - and business interests, and his close links with other cricketing countries continued through out his life. Just before the attack that led to his death, he was named as Australia's first Honorary Consul in Trinidad and Tobago.""]",[],32.0,56,5,2159.0,160,42.33,,,4,12,,3,20.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,117.0,194,16,7942,324,44.61,,,14,38,,,92.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32.0,23,990,507,13.0,3/32,3/47,39.0,3.07,76.1,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,117.0,,4413,2482,55,3/32,,45.12,3.37,80.2,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

His exceptional Test batting average tells little about the manner in which he made the runs, his elegant yet powerful style marked by all the shots, but memorably his off-side play. As a batsman he was great, as a bowler, merely superb, but would have made the West Indies side as a bowler alone.

When he first played for West Indies, against England at Bridgetown in 1929-30, he was 17 years 122 days, at the time the youngest-ever Test cricketer. He still is the youngest to have played for West Indies. He was to become more than a very good, quick-footed batsman, occasionally bowling effectively at medium pace and twice (against England in 1939) keeping wicket in Test matches. He epitomised the natural cricketing ability of so many West Indians, his cap at a rakish angle, the bat seeming to be an extension of himself, often smiling, always friendly. As a boy, in his first Test match, he was placed in the order between Headley and Constantine and scored 58 against an England attack which included Voce, Rhodes and Stevens. In Australia in 1930-31 he had a disappointing tour and was not chosen to go to England in 1933. In 1934-35, by when he was 22, he averaged 45 in the four Test matches against Bob Wyatt's England team, only Headley, with whom he added 202 for West Indies' third wicket at Kingston in the fourth Test match, doing better. In England in 1939 he made his highest first-class score, 181 in three and a half hours against Middlesex at Lord's, although more was expected of him as a batsman than he achieved.  Sealy, wrote "", ', not unlike Headley in appearance at the wicket, and somewhat similar in forcing tactics, showed less ability to score when playing back, but he gave some attractive displays. In 1941-42, for Barbados against Trinidad in Bridgetown, he had a large share in a remarkable record, taking 8 for 8 runs as Trinidad were bowled out for 16 on a sticky wicket. After the war, having moved to Trinidad, he made no particular impact on West Indian cricket. He continued, however, to bring happiness wherever he went. In 11 Tests he scored 478 runs (average 28.11), with a highest score of 92 against England at Port-of-Spain in 1934-35, and took 3 for 94. His overall first-class record was 3,831 runs at an average of 30.40 and 63 wickets at 28.60 apiece.\n', ' \n']",[],11.0,19.0,2.0,478.0,92,28.11,,,0.0,3.0,,3.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,,,0.0,,14.47,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,80.0,134,8,3831,181,30.40,,,8,16,,,67.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,6,156,94,3.0,2/7,2/23,31.33,3.61,52.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,32.91,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,80.0,,,1802,63,8/8,,28.60,,,,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

After his first Test innings, 84 not out against Pakistan, Ted Dexter was moved to predict a Test average of more than 50 - quite a millstone to hang around any young player's neck. But on his first tour, to England in 2000, Sarwan lived up to the hype by topping the averages. His footwork, which seemed to require no early trigger movements, was strikingly confident and precise. \n"", ""It was a surprise when he then produced a horror run of three runs in five innings in Australia, but against India in 2001-02 he was back to his composed best. Sarwan, who took over as Brian Lara's vice-captain in March 2003, required 28 matches and 49 innings to post his maiden Test century - 119 in December 2002 - and even then it came against the less-than-mighty Bangladeshis. As the likes of Graham Gooch and Steve Waugh can testify, the first time is often the hardest. "", 'A dream series against South Africa in 2003-04, where he averaged nearly 100 runs a Test, was followed by a lean run against England. But he returned to form in a stunning manner with an unbeaten 261 against Bangladesh in June. Then came an England tour in 2004 where he began and ended the tour on a low note, but was prolific in the middle. However, West Indian fortunes were on the ascendancy in one-dayers, as they reached the finals of the NatWest Series and then won the ICC Champions Trophy with Sarwan playing a big hand in both tournaments. ', 'Sarwan was one of the players involved in a contract dispute with WICB and missed the first Test against South Africa in 2005. On his return he scored attractive runs, but was again overlooked for the captaincy when it was handed back to Brian Lara. ', ""He didn't fare well with the bat in the 2006-07 season, averaging just 25.90 in 13 games he played till the end of the Champions Trophy. It was still a shock when he was dropped from the second Test against Pakistan in the away series in November. He returned for the third Test and sustained a foot injury which kept him out of the one-dayers against Pakistan and the tour of India."", ""Finally, the West Indies captaincy came his way following Lara's retirement. It wasn't exactly a field full of promising candidates as West Indies cricket yearned for true leadership. Injuries limited his appearances in 2007, and a friendly captaincy competition between Sarwan and Gayle continued with both players publicly supporting one another. Sarwan was Gayle's deputy on his return to the side in 2008 for the home series against Sri Lanka but the demotion did not affect his output, and he made three half-centuries and a hundred in the two Tests."", 'In the 2009 home series against England, Sarwan recorded his personal best of 291 in the first innings of the fourth Test, equalling the highest score for the West Indies made by Sir Vivian Richards. He scored his 15th Test century against England at Chester-le-Street in May of the same year but West Indies lost the series 2-0. ', 'The following year, Sarwan lost his central contract in 2010, subsequently winning damages from the West Indies Cricket Board over comments made about his attitude and fitness. He played his last Test against India in Bridgetown in July 2011. ', ""Having fallen out of international favour, he signed for English county Leicestershire for the 2012 English season and enjoyed noteworthy success in a struggling side, scoring two centuries in the Championship, another two in 40-over matches and falling short of 1,000 first-class runs largely because injury caused him to miss two matches.  He agreed to return as four-day captain in 2013 but played only half the season because of injury and West Indies' limited-overs commitments."", 'West Indies recalled him for the first time in 18 months for the limited overs side that toured Australia in early 2013, although it was an inauspicious return.  He was out without scoring in each of the first two ODIs and omitted after the third, in which he made 12.

When he started his Test career at 19, without yet representing his native Jamaica in a first-class match, his composure and skill prompted comparisons - quite unfairly - with Viv Richards. His technique was near to faultless, and he exudes a bull-headed confidence - he used to skip his schoolwork on the basis that exams were irrelevant to future Test cricketers. \n', ""However, that confidence, which often overflowed into perceived arrogance, has landed him in plenty of trouble. It almost got him sent home from India late in 2002 after he defied a team curfew - but he was kept on, and responded with his a disciplined maiden Test century in Kolkata. His lack of consistency meant he remained an irregular member of the team in the 2000s, but just before his selection for the 2007 World Cup, he was drawn into a major controversy after Nagpur police alleged that he passed on match-related information to an alleged bookie ahead of an ODI against India. He was included in the World Cup squad despite the ICC's investigations into the issue, where he only briefly shone, ending the tournament by running out Brian Lara in his last international innings."", 'He was called for the World Twenty20 in South Africa in 2007, but the match-fixing allegations reared its head in 2008 when he was found guilty of ""receiving money, or benefit or other reward that could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute."" Samuels was subsequently banned for two years, at a time when West Indies desperately needed solidity in their middle-order. He returned to the West Indies Test and ODI teams in 2011, but it was only on the tour to England in 2012 that he finally showed what he was capable of. Against a top-class bowling attack in difficult conditions, Samuels scored 386 runs in five innings, with a century and three fifties, defying the England bowlers every time with his correct technique and classy strokeplay. Later that year came a highlight of his career: a gutsy, snappy 78 in the World Twenty20 final against Sri Lanka, which lifted West Indies out of a hole and to their first world title since the 1979 World Cup.', ""A month after the World T20 triumph, Samuels notched up his first Test double-century, scoring 260 against Bangladesh in Khulna. Consistency eluded him, however, as the big scores were often followed by dips in form and injuries. A facial injury suffered during the Big Bash League in January 2013 ruled him out of West Indies' limited-overs tour to Australia. He picked up a four-for on his return to international cricket against Zimbabwe but his batting form did not improve. Samuels scored just two international hundreds, both in ODIs, in the two seasons following the double-hundred and his lack of form in Tests, and competitions like the World T20, only contributed further to West Indies' struggles. As a result of his poor form, he was dropped after just one Test in the home series against New Zealand in June 2014. "", 'Samuels, who is a handy part-time offspinner, was reported for a suspect action during the second Test against India in Mumbai in November 2013, along with offspinner Shane Shillingford. Following a biomechanical analysis of his action, Samuels was barred from bowling quicker deliveries in international cricket in December 2013.']",[],71.0,127.0,7.0,3917.0,260,32.64,8219.0,47.65,7.0,24.0,537.0,32.0,28.0,0.0,207.0,196,26,5606.0,133*,32.97,7463,75.11,10,30,526,118,50.0,0.0,67.0,65,10,1611.0,89*,29.29,1386,116.23,0,10,144,69,12.0,0.0,122.0,211,12,7295,260,36.65,,,14,40,,,68.0,0.0,275.0,261,36,7652,133*,34.00,,,14,44,,,66.0,0.0,187.0,181.0,38.0,4571.0,106*,31.96,3876.0,117.93,2.0,29.0,388.0,191.0,45.0,0.0,71.0,69,4392,2445,41.0,4/13,6/50,59.63,3.34,107.1,1,0,0,207.0,134,5091,4127,89.0,3/12,3/12,46.37,4.86,57.2,0,0,0,67.0,30,479,622,22.0,3/23,3/23,28.27,7.79,21.7,0,0,0,122.0,,7432,3909,71,5/87,,55.05,3.15,104.6,,1,0,275.0,,7003,5464,135,4/21,4/21,40.47,4.68,51.8,2,0,0,187.0,92,1636,1957,70,3/10,3/10,27.95,7.17,23.3,0,0,0,False,True,False,True
