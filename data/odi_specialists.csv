He signed for Sussex in 1999, spending 5 years there and was part of the squad that lifted the County Championship in 2003. \n', ""Zuiderent didn't play a great deal of international cricket in that period, and after a disappointing run at the 2003 World Cup it appeared that he might never build on the potential he showed in his youth. But with increasing age he has matured into a very steady middle-order batsman, and his unbeaten 116 against the United Arab Emirates in the 2005 ICC Trophy secured World Cup qualification for Netherlands as they scraped through in 5th place.

He was discarded after a disappointing tour to England in 2002, but he trained hard and regained pace, nip and bounce off the pitch. Most importantly, though, he returned with the delivery that moves back into the right-hander, a weapon that makes him a far more potent force. \n', ""A natural striker of the ball, he's also emerged as a useful lower-order strokeplayer.

In full flow, he was a sight for sore eyes. His avarice for runs matched that of the Australian legend, and that was why he was dubbed the Asian Bradman. High praise indeed for there have been many greats but none matches the aura of the Don.  \n', ""There was not a touch of arrogance about Zaheer's batting but of lyrical, fluent movement, his innings memorable for a refined, effortless beauty. His strength was precision and timing. He had the ability to go on back and front foot with equal facility, on occasions moving from backward to forward or vice versa during the course of one stroke and yet send the ball crashing to the fence. A high back-lift gave him a touch of elegance, and combined with powerful and supple wrists guiding the ball into the gaps on both sides of the wicket, he scored a very high proportion of his runs in boundaries. When the going was good, he seemed like a maestro at work, his artistry, his elegance leaving connoisseurs awestruck. "", ""Zaheer's first big score came in England, a double hundred, 274 to be precise, at Edgbaston in only his second Test. With that innings, not only did he prove the pundits wrong, who thought that his technique and high backlift would make him highly suspect against the seaming ball, it also heralded the arrival of a new international star. Such was his mastery, so profound his concentration that he never seemed like getting out. He may have gone on and on, when sheer exhaustion got him; by the time he got out he had batted for nine hours and 10 minutes."", 'Many counties lined up to recruit this lean and bespectacled youth, but he opted for Gloucestershire, a less fashionable choice but one which he did not regret. He never switched to another county, playing for Gloucester right to the end, making runs year on year in a huge pile, well in excess of 1,000 almost every season, 2,544 in one glorious Indian summer of 1976 and another 2305 in 1981. ', 'Having already scored another double hundred (240) in the Oval Test in 1974 and some big scores on the Australian tour of 1976-77 including 101 at Adelaide, he was signed up by the Kerry Packer circus, which resulted in his missing two rubbers against England. When the Packer bunch was welcomed back to the fold for the Indian series, the first between the two in 18 years, Zaheer was at his majestic best, putting to sword the feared Indian spin quartet to notch scores of 176, 96 and 235 in successive innings. His tally of 583 runs in a short rubber was then a world record. ', 'The only Asian to have made a century of centuries in first class cricket to date, he really had a Bradmanesque appetite for runs. Nothing reflects this better than his making a century in each innings on eight occasions in a first class match, a world record. All the more amazing is the fact that in four out of these eight, he made a double hundred and a hundred. His 100th hundred, predictably, a double hundred (215) against India in the 1982-83 Lahore Test was followed by two more Test hundreds in that series. ', 'That was the last of his great series, and though he got the captaincy, which he so desired when Imran Khan got his famous shin injury, he only played one major innings, an unbeaten 168, again at Lahore, again against India. Never really comfortable against genuine pace, but then nobody really is, by then age was catching up fast and his reflexes had deteriorated a great deal. ', 'For one who was the epitome of grace in batting, his exit was rather unseemly as he opted out of the last Test of his career at Karachi in 1985-86 against Sri Lanka, not allowing himself a proper farewell. Zaheer blamed it on senior players, on Imran Khan in an indirect way. But perhaps he did so in a fit of pique, because having announced his retirement from Test cricket, he still wanted to remain active in the one-day version of the game. And the selectors, certainly with Imran prompting them, would have none of it. Whatever the reason, none would dispute that Zaheer deserved a better send off than he got.\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1972'],78.0,124,11,5062.0,274,44.79,,,12,20,,22,34.0,0.0,62.0,60,6,2572.0,123,47.62,3033,84.80,7,13,,,16.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,459.0,768,92,34843,274,51.54,,,108,158,,,278.0,0.0,323.0,309,33,11240,158*,40.72,,,19,72,,,78.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78.0,14,370,132,3.0,2/21,2/26,44.0,2.14,123.3,0,0,0,62.0,12,280,223,7.0,2/26,2/26,31.85,4.77,40.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,459.0,,2582,1146,30,5/15,,38.20,2.66,86.0,,1,0,323.0,,828,689,16,3/48,3/48,43.06,4.99,51.7,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Born in Southend, but bred in Western Australia, Mullally began with WA, had brief spells with Hampshire and Victoria, before moving to Leicestershire. A winter in the gym in 1998-99 gave his bowling extra edge and movement, and he returned to Hampshire (he loves the sea) to team up with Shane Warne in 2000. They took wickets - but no-one else did. Mullally's batting is a joke, although the 16 he made against a fired-up Glenn McGrath in Melbourne in 1998-99 proved decisive - England won by 12 runs.

What he observed - not just from his own side's lacklustre display, but the inspiration provided by Brendon McCullum's New Zealand side - convinced him an entirely new approach was necessary in England's cricket with a policy of No Fear (and No Retribution) at its heart. It required a man of strong will not just to say it, but to implement it, but Morgan did so, seeking to fashion a side that would play with courage and be impervious to pressure or criticism. \n"", 'The revival he led was dramatic. Going into the 2019 World Cup year, England were rated not only the No. 1 ODI side but had set a host of new records, including the two highest scores made in the format. Morgan, relentlessly committed to this bold style of play on good days and bad, was at the heart of the transformation.', ""Morgan's self-sufficiency and independent thought has caused him to tread a path that has not always been popular with English administrators. He preferred the IPL to county cricket long before it was ECB policy. Although he strove for a while to play for England in all three formats, he played the last of his 16 Tests in 2012 and his interest in the longer format appeared to wane once he recognised he had little chance of a recall. He didn't play any first-class cricket in 2016 or 2017 and averaged 11 when he returned for half-a-dozen games in 2018. A somewhat private man, he is respected by his players for his inner strength, cool temperament and tactical nous but remains largely a closed book to those outside the dressing room."", 'Once the selectors had decided to dispense with Alastair Cook just before Christmas in 2014, Morgan, the regular ODI deputy, was the most obvious candidate.  But his elevation coincided with one of his worst periods of form since switching to England from Ireland. A left-hander who quickly built a reputation for inventive and audacious strokeplay, Morgan also possessed the patience and power of shot to be a natural ""finisher"" - a role England had struggled to fill for a decade. In some ways, he was a prototype, encouraging the English game to adopt a more inventive approach only subsequently to face up to the challenge that he might be overtaken by more highly-powered models.', 'As a young man in Dublin, Morgan was recognised as a cricketer of rare unorthodox talent, who plays the ball exceptionally late and was adroit both at sweeping and reverse sweeping. Time at Dulwich College only hardened his desire to play for England, which he never tried to hide back in Ireland.', ""Morgan made his Ireland debut at the age of 16, making 99 against Scotland in Ayr, and was soon signed by Middlesex, who gave him his debut a week after his 19th birthday. He floundered in the 2007 World Cup: batting at No. 3, he made only 91 runs in nine games. But he soon established himself in the Middlesex line up, especially in limited overs cricket, and his switch to England was long anticipated. After securing Ireland's qualification for the 2011 World Cup, in April 2009, he was called up by England, thereby denying Ireland the chances to pick him in the World T20 and beyond."", ""At the age of 23, he shot to prominence on the back of two match-winning innings against South Africa. First was a 34-ball 67 in the Champions Trophy in September 2009, followed two months later with an unbeaten 45-ball 85 in the opening Twenty20 of England's tour of South Africa. His bold approach and crisp hitting evoked comparisons with Kevin Pietersen."", 'His growing stature was confirmed when he was the only England player to be awarded a new contract at the auction for the third season of the IPL in January 2010. He was signed for $220,000 by Bangalore, where he joined England team-mate Pietersen. But he failed to make an impression and was soon left on the bench. He returned to his best for England in the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean as his powerful shot-making and coolness under pressure helped England to their first triumph in global limited-overs events. With three ODI hundreds that year, his first for England coming against Bangladesh in Dhaka, his reputation was soaring.', ""Despite a modest first-class record he was rewarded with a surprise call-up to the Test side for England's first Test of the 2010 summer, against Bangladesh. Walking out to bat at 258 for 4, he could not have asked for a gentler introduction and showed enough confidence to pick up his first Test boundary with a reverse-sweep. With the retirement of Paul Collingwood, a permanent space opened up in England's Test side. Centuries against Pakistan (2010) and India (2011) represented the high points."", 'But a disastrous tour of the UAE in early 2012 effectively ended his Test career. With Joe Root making his debut before the end of the year, he never returned to the Test side.', ""He remained an indispensable member of the one-day side, though. And while there were prolonged fallow periods - from September 2012, for example, he went a year and 17 innings without an ODI half-century and, by the time he was appointed captain, he had scored one fifty in 19 innings - he produced enough outstanding innings (not least a match-defining century against Ireland) to retain his place. Going into the 2019 World Cup, he was England's record run-scorer in ODIs."", 'While his captaincy record at domestic level was not inspiring - Middlesex won five out of 22 limited-overs matches under him in 2014 - and the 2015 World Cup campaign was painfully poor, progress was fast once England embraced a new coaching regime (Peter Moores was sacked in May 2015) and bolder selections. A watershed series against New Zealand saw England, so hesitant and mediocre at the World Cup, pass 350 three times in 10 days in registering their highest ever ODI total (408-9; subsequently overtaken) and their highest ever second-innings total (365-9; also subsequently overtaken). A new template had been set.', ""Such was Morgan's statute within the side, he survived his decision to skip the Bangladesh tour in 2016 on security grounds - the players had been given a choice whether to tour, though the impression remained the management had rather hoped the captain would lead the way - and oversaw a spell of 12 bi-lateral series wins out of 13, including nine in a row broken only by an aberrational defeat against Scotland.

He took the opportunities that came his way, scoring 104 against New South Wales in 1982-83, and when Marsh retired he was the automatic choice. He was picked for Australia's tour of New Zealand in 1986-87 and was expected to hold down the Test role for some time. But he had the misfortune of being part of a side in transition and that, allied to his sometimes explosive personality, led to his being replaced by Greg Dyer, briefly, and then Ian Healy. From then on Zoehrer's role was as Healy's understudy. He toured England in 1989 and 1993 - when he finished second to Shane Warne in the first-class bowling averages with 12 wickets at 20.83 - and made his final international appearance in a World Series match in 1993-94, a one-off after almost seven years out of the side.  The impression that he was destined to spend his time in the shadows was cemented when WA  imported Adam Gilchrist from New South Wales to replace him.

One is a flamboyant left-handed opener for England's one-day side, who exploits fielding restrictions in the first 15 overs by slapping the ball over mid-on and carving it through point.

His two best Test innings (113 v Pakistan, Headingley in 1996, and 96 in the flippin'-murdered-'em draw v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo in 1996-97) seemed to set him up, but he was dropped after a poor series in New Zealand that winter, and has won only five more caps, four of them in 2000. Knight was harshly left out of the World Cup team in 1999, but seemed set to make amends in 2003 after several impressive displays in the VB Series, which led seasoned Australian observers to wonder why on earth he wasn't a Test regular.  But after England's failure in the World Cup, he called time on his international one-day career - but not Tests - to enable him to concentrate on leading Warwickshire.  Knight, who began his career at Essex but moved to Warwickshire in 1995, is a world-class fielder - whether at third slip, in the gully, at short midwicket or as a cover sweeper - and an outgoing, hard-to-suppress team man.

He joined Somerset when he was 18 and made his international debut four years later, little more than a week after qualifying for England. He was briefly England\'s answer at the top of the order, helping them win the 2010 World Twenty20 and rise up the one-day rankings. But his form stuttered and he was dropped after the India tour in January 2013. He returned to the squad at the 2014 World T20 but failed to add to his 46 one-day internationals and 25 T20Is. During the subsequent English season, he suffered a sickening blow in the face, breaking his nose and damaging his eye socket while batting against Northants when a delivery from David Willey burst through his grille. It forced him into retirement in June 2015 as he conceded defeat to impaired vision and what he indicated was psychological trauma. ""I feel I will never be mentally the player I was,"" he said. \n', 'He played for South Africa at the 2006 Under-19 World Cup before coming to Millfield School. He made his Somerset first-team debut in April 2007, scoring 69 not out off 58 balls and taking a catch his coach described as ""world class"". The batsmen-friendly conditions at Taunton aided his attacking instincts and in the 2009 English season, his last before he qualified, he scored 1,242 runs at a 59.14 in the County Championship as well as averaging almost 50 in one-day cricket.', 'The selectors, who had been watching for some time, rewarded him with a place on the Lions tour of UAE although Geoff Miller did caution that England ""had to be careful about the number of South Africans in the side"". Yet Kieswetter was undeterred and repeated his allegiance to England when Graeme Smith said he\'d like to him to come back to South Africa.', ""The day after he became eligible for England in February 2010 he hit 81 against the senior side in Abu Dhabi, enough to earn a rapid elevation to the full squad for Bangladesh where his first innings of the tour was the small matter of 143. It was a promising sign. He made a century in his third ODI, against Bangladesh before playing a crucial role in delivering England's first ever global limited-overs success in the World Twenty20. Alongside Michael Lumb, Kieswetter powered England to aggressive starts, making 222 runs in the tournament, the fourth-highest tally, including a Man-of-the-Match winning 63 in the final against Australia."", 'But that proved his high water mark. In his next 18 T20s for England, Kieswetter made only two half-centuries and was eventually dropped for the crucial World T20 tie against Sri Lanka in 2012.

In opponents' eyes, he was England's most wanted man for the seven years until his retirement at the end of the 2001 Ashes. Thrust into the captaincy at the age of 25, he proved more durable than successful, but after finally resigning in 1998, he slipped comfortably into the role of elder statesman. Australia seldom saw the best of him, but his relish for a personal duel did much to bring about series victories over both South Africa (1998) and West Indies (2000).

He was McGrath's bunny for the sixth time in this series and for a world-record 19th time in all."", 'But records are just numbers, and numbers tell you next to nothing about Atherton. A final Test average of 38 adds up to just an adequate Test cricketer. But he was more than adequate, much more. For a decade he held England together. Nobody in the world has scored more Test runs since the start of the 1990s. He was the toffee apple surrounded by candy floss, the wicket above all others that the opposition savoured.', 'He was strong off the back foot, happiest pulling the fast bowlers, happiest of all when his back (which gave him much pain over the years) was forced against the wall. His defining moment came at Johannesburg in 1995-96, with a 643-minute 185 not out, which defied the forces of Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock and saved a Test that had been down and out. Make that defining monument.', 'And then two and a half years later, again against South Africa, again against Donald, he sealed his reputation.

An Englishman who made runs during the 1990s was forgiven anything.', ""He was an unconventional cricketer. He didn't marry early, he hasn't had children, he didn't care to flash his private life around the papers. He preferred Pat Barker to Tom Clancy and chess to PlayStation.

His talents have been particularly apparent in Test cricket where his command of swing bowling, especially on his home grounds, has been the stuff of artistry, bearing comparison with any swing bowler in any age. He has been an integral part of three victorious Ashes campaigns and became the first England bowler to take 500 Test wickets, leaving Ian Botham's previous benchmark of 383 a mere dot on the horizon. His one-day career has also had its moments as he gradually became adept at bowling in a more defensive fashion, but it is as an attacking swing bowler where he has had few peers. \n"", 'Anderson\'s 500th Test wicket came in September 2017 when he dismissed Kraigg Brathwaite in a Lord\'s Test against the West Indies. It was a delivery that illustrated his talent, coming down the slope to hit middle stump (his 501st - to bowl Kieran Powell - was even better). He became only the sixth player, and third pace bowler seamer after McGrath and Courtney Walsh, to reach the landmark and admitted to feeling emotional. ""Normally it\'s anger but today it was a bit more, not quite teary but emotional. I don\'t get like that when trying to focus on my job and it took me a bit by surprise.""', 'Anderson has been something of a contradiction. He has had a reputation for being shy and uncommunicative off the field, except in the company of close friends, yet on the field his verbal aggression, which he has argued is necessary to conquer that diffident character, not always endeared him to opponents or critics.', ""For the first six years of Anderson's international career, the best way to sum up his bowling was to paraphrase Mother Goose: when he's good, he's very, very good - and when he's bad, he's horrid. But when the force was with him, he was capable of irresistible spells, seemingly able to swing the ball round corners at an impressive speed."", ""Anderson had played only three one-day games for Lancashire when he was hurried into England's one-day squad in Australia in 2002-03 as cover for Andy Caddick. He didn't have a number - or even a name - on his shirt, but a remarkable ten-over stint, costing just 12 runs, in century heat at Adelaide earned him a World Cup spot. There, he produced a matchwinning spell against Pakistan before a sobering last-over disaster against Australia."", ""Five wickets followed in the first innings of his debut Test, against Zimbabwe at home in 2003, then a one-day hat-trick against Pakistan, but his fortunes waned. For a couple of years Anderson was a peripheral net bowler as attempts to change his action to avoid injury affected his pace and rhythm. That oft-predicted stress fracture kept him out for most of 2006, but he still made the Australian tour and the World Cup. However, as England's 2005 Ashes-winning attack began to fall apart, Anderson made his second coming - starting in Wellington on the 2007-08 tour of New Zealand, where he and Stuart Broad were united for the first time. The same opponents were blown away at Trent Bridge (Anderson 7 for 43) a few weeks later, during a summer that earned Anderson the honour of being named among Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year. He marked the award, given at the start of the 2009 season, by making the West Indians looked clueless at Chester-le-Street (nine wickets in the match)."", 'In 2010 Anderson came of age in a staggeringly comprehensive fashion. No longer content with being unplayable when the mood caught him, he took the decision to shelve the ""magic balls"" and concentrated on hammering out a rock-solid line and length, with dot balls and maidens his new holy grail. The upshot was a scintillating year in which he proved unhittable in every sense, with an economy rate that ramped up the pressure in every spell, and a range of weapons that made him a threat on every surface. ', 'A career-best 11-wicket haul against Pakistan at Trent Bridge, when he came as close to unplayable as at any time in his career, was the prelude to a breakthrough tour of Australia in the winter of 2010-11. Anderson arrived to a torrent of doubters, who recalled his forlorn performance on the preceding Ashes four years earlier, in which he had taken five wickets at 82.60. But he left with a series-sealing 24 scalps at 26.04, and a reputation transformed. ', 'Deadly with conventional swing and seam, and with a new line in reverse swing as well, he had become arguably the most complete fast bowler in the world. He was awarded the Freedom of Burnley - his home town - in 2012, which was also his benefit year, and also eased past Brian Statham\'s 252 Test wickets to become Lancashire\'s most successful England bowler. His increased range was demonstrated in India the following winter, when Anderson claimed 12 wickets at 30.25 but was described by MS Dhoni as ""the major difference between the two sides"".', ""In 2013, fittingly at Lord's, a ground where enjoyed much success, he became the fourth England bowler to reach 300 Test wickets when he had Peter Fulton caught at slip. When he began the Ashes with a match-winning 10-wicket haul at Trent Bridge his form showed no signs of abating, but the following nine Tests against Australia were far less successful as a chastened England returned home after the battering down under in 2013-14."", ""Anderson took 37 wickets in seven Tests against Sri Lanka and India in 2014, but his reputation was sullied by a verbal confrontation in the first Test at Trent Bridge with India's Ravindra Jadeja and accusations of pushing and shoving on the way in the dressing room corridor. India insisted that his behaviour had become unacceptable, but the resulting ICC investigation could not separate the truth from the lies and both men got off lightly. The World Cup in the antipodes was another unhappy episode, as the curtain came down on Anderson's 194-game ODI career - another format in which he was England's leading wicket-taking exponent - after an ignominious group-stage exit."", ""By then, England's Test bowling records were bound to fall his way. He passed Botham's record Test-wicket haul in the Caribbean and shortly afterwards reached 400 against New Zealand at Headingley. His fitness remained exemplary, his action as rhythmical as ever, and his appetite still powerful enough to imagine, as he passed his 33rd birthday, playing for another five years. A northern spring, Sri Lanka the opposition, cheered him with three five-wicket hails in successive Tests in Leeds and Chester-le-Street in 2016, but a shoulder injury marred his summer and he was innocuous on Indian pitches as England slumped to a 4-0 defeat that winter. "", ""The 500-mark beckoned, however, and a fit-again Anderson averaged 14.10 during the home series against South Africa and West Indies. He was the pick of the attack as England were crushed in Australia yet again, and continued to rule the roost at home. When he bowled Mohammed Shami to complete England's 4-1 win over India and record his 564th Test wicket, McGrath's pace-bowling record was eclipsed - and there were tears on the outfield from Anderson, as he contemplated the retirement of his great mate Alastair Cook."", ""That Anderson's left-hand batting has also steadily improved from his early days as a fully paid-up rabbit was illustrated when he struck 81 against India in 2014 - his maiden first-class fifty - as he shared a Test record stand of 198 for the tenth wicket with Joe Root in the first innings. He has served England with distinction as a nightwatchman on numerous occasions and went 54 Test innings before collecting a duck, an England record. At Cardiff in 2009 he survived for 69 nail-chewing minutes to help stave off defeat by Australia. He has also been an outstanding fielder, strikingly so for a fast bowler, lithe in the outfield and sharp in the catching positions."", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2002', 'Awarded the OBE in June 2015']",148.0,207.0,86.0,1174.0,81,9.7,2940.0,39.93,0.0,1.0,159.0,3.0,91.0,0.0,194.0,79,43,273.0,28,7.58,561,48.66,0,0,23,0,53.0,0.0,19.0,4,3,1.0,1*,1.00,2,50.0,0,0,0,0,3.0,0.0,239.0,308,124,1790,81,9.72,,,0,1,,,140.0,0.0,255.0,102,62,371,28,9.27,,,0,0,,,65.0,0.0,44.0,10,6,23,16,5.75,26,88.46,0,0,3,0,8.0,0.0,148.0,277,32335,15490,575.0,7/42,11/71,26.93,2.87,56.2,27,27,3,194.0,191,9584,7861,269.0,5/23,5/23,29.22,4.92,35.6,11,2,0,19.0,19,422,552,18.0,3/23,3/23,30.66,7.84,23.4,0,0,0,239.0,,48503,23446,920,7/42,,25.48,2.90,52.7,40,45,6,255.0,,12414,10003,352,5/23,5/23,28.41,4.83,35.2,11,2,0,44.0,44,933,1318,41,3/23,3/23,32.14,8.47,22.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Moeen was tighter at Lord's, devastating in Southampton and excellent at Old Trafford as he finished the series with 19 wickets; the fourth highest haul any spinner had claimed against India in a Test series outside the subcontinent and the best since 1967 when Ray Illingworth bowled 30 more overs and claimed one more victim."", 'While he struggled to recapture his batting form in Test cricket, he took his chance when promoted to the top of the order in the ODI side by hitting a 72-ball century in Colombo and ended the year a regular in all formats.', 'He had looked destined for such success for some time. Signed by Warwickshire as a 15-year-old, he made a century on first-class debut against Cambridge MCCU (he remains the second-youngest man to score a first-class half-century for the club) and Championship debut against Nottinghamshire but was dropped for the next game on both occasions. He also captained England U-19s to the semi-final of the 2006 World Cup, blasted a 56-ball century in an U-19 Test against Sri Lanka and, as a 14-year-old, smashed 195 not out in a Twenty20 match for his under-15 club side Moseley Ashfield. The next highest score was 11.', ""But, frustrated by a lack of opportunity at Warwickshire during Mark Greatbatch's ill-fated reign as coach of the club, he left for local rivals Worcestershire at the end of 2006 and was a key part of the team that won the Pro-40 title in 2007. It included a 46-ball century against Northants in 2007; there had, at the time, been only one faster List A century made in England in matches involving two first-class counties."", ""There were setbacks. Trying to combat a tendency to nick off, he went through a period of batting like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and then a spell of leaving balls that hit his off stump instead. But he made 1270 runs at 47.03 in 2010 and 1375 runs at 62.50 in 2013 - the year he won the PCA's most valuable player award - as he augmented his flair with increased discipline outside off stump. And, all the time, he was working on his offspin, claiming 33 wickets at 29.00 in 2012 and 28 at 33.71 a later year."", 'It was enough to earn him an England call-up for the ODI series in the West Indies at the start of 2014 and the World T20 in Bangladesh a few weeks later.', ""His older brother, Kadeer, played for Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Leicestershire while their cousin, Kabir was once a team-mate of Moeen's at Worcestershire, and was the first of the family to play international cricket. "", 'Moeen\'s development had a significance beyond the playing field. Taking on the mantle of role-model for fellow British Asians - a sector of society that county cricket has not always encouraged as it might have done - he also talked eloquently of his Muslim faith and grew perhaps the most noticeable beard in English cricket since the days of WG Grace.

Shahzad has proven his worth time and again with a series of thrilling batting displays, often producing his own version of the helicopter shot, and his fearlessness at the crease makes him one of the few Associate batsmen capable of standing toe-to-toe against Full Member opposition. \n', ""Shahzad had yet to make his debut when Afghanistan's magic carpet ride took them from WCL Division Five in 2008 to three straight promotions up the Associate cricket ladder, but he proved to be a valuable addition to the squad at his maiden tournament, the 2009 World Cup Qualifier in South Africa. Needing a win in their final Super Eight match to secure ODI status for an initial four-year period, Shahzad struck 73 in a 21-run victory over Namibia. Afghanistan made that that cherished ODI status more permanent, with Shahzad at the forefront of the batting unit, most prominently in T20s. He has played a starring role in each of Afghanistan's World T20 Qualifier campaigns to secure four consecutive berths at the World T20, beginning in 2010, and he is far and away his country's career leading scorer in the format. "", ""Due to his adventurous strokeplay and the nature of Afghanistan's membership status, Shahzad has sometimes been unfairly stereotyped as a limited-overs specialist but he has an adaptable technique to play long-form cricket too. Eleven days after his 64* off 46 balls ensured a successful chase against Ireland in the 2010 World T20 Qualifier final, Shahzad engineered one of the greatest heists in first-class history, scoring a fourth-innings 214 not out to overhaul a target of 494 in a 2010 Intercontinental Cup match against Canada. "", ""The one blemish on Shahzad's ledger is linked to his weight, which has been a fluctuating concern under different management regimes. The short and stocky wicketkeeper received a major wake-up call when he was left out of Afghanistan's final 15-man squad for the 2015 World Cup on fitness grounds by then coach Andy Moles. The sting of missing Afghanistan's maiden appearance at the ICC's showpiece event in Australia and New Zealand spurred him on to a wondrous revival and at the end of 2016 he was named the ICC Associate & Affiliate Cricketer of the Year, the first Afghan to claim the honour. "", 'In January 2017, Shahzad achieved a rare feat of scoring two T20I half-centuries in a day, leading Afghanistan to victories over Oman and Ireland in the morning semi-final and evening final of the inaugural Desert T20 Challenge in Dubai. It would later emerge that in a drug test taken just days earlier, Shahzad tested positive for the banned substance Clenbuterol, which Shahzad claimed to have inadvertently ingested through his use of the weight-loss supplement Hydroxycut. After a provisional suspension started in April 2017, he was retroactively suspended for one year and became eligible to play again on January 17, 2018.

On a tour of India he caught Mike Gatting's eye with a century against a visiting MCC side.

A year and a half later, while back on tour in Zimbabwe in February 2017, the precocious legspinner fetched the highest ever bid for an Associate player in the IPL Auction. He was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for INR 4 crores (US$ 597,000).  \n"", '\nIn the intervening time, Rashid quickly established himself as an automatic pick for Afghanistan. Not a big turner of the ball, he puts batsmen under constant pressure by bowling quickly through the air, akin to his bowling idol Shahid Afridi, while maintaining a stump-to-stump line. His biggest weapon is a very accurate googly, and should it result in a wicket, don\'t be surprised if he borrows Afridi\'s signature ""Star man"" celebration. ', '\nRashid is also an athletic fielder, often placed in the covers, a region of high traffic in one-day cricket. With bat in hand, he is more than capable of clearing the boundary late in an innings and has air-brushed many a middling total into a match-winning one for his team. ', ""\nDomestically, Rashid has been a productive force for the Kabul Eagles franchise. He parlayed his success from a superb first season with Sunrisers into franchise deals with Guyana Amazon Warriors - with whom he claimed the CPL's first ever hat-trick in 2017 - and Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash. He continued scaling new heights for Afghanistan as well, taking 5 for 3 in a T20I against Ireland to keep a record 11-match T20I winning streak alive and later in 2017 helped spin his country to victory over West Indies in their maiden ODI in the Caribbean with figures of 7 for 18, the fourth-best haul for anyone in ODI cricket. It all added up to Rashid being honoured as the 2017 ICC Associate Cricketer of the Year. "", ""In January 2018, Rashid's status as a global superstar was cemented when he became Afghanistan's first IPL millionaire after Sunrisers reclaimed him at auction for INR 9 crores (US$ 1.4 million). Rashid's charisma has turned him into a crowd favourite at every stop. After showcasing his dominance in franchise leagues and against Associate competition, Afghanistan's promotion to Full Membership and entry into Test cricket is an opportunity for Rashid to demonstrate his ability to be a transcendent figure across all formats.""]",[],2.0,3,0,29.0,12,9.66,31,93.54,0,0,3,1,0.0,0.0,57.0,42,9,782.0,60*,23.69,776,100.77,0,4,70,22,18,0,38.0,17,8,123.0,33,13.66,99,124.24,0,0,8,8,11.0,0.0,6.0,7,1,154,52,25.66,198,77.77,0,1,21,1,0,0,59.0,43,9,803,60*,23.61,790,101.64,0,4,75,22,19.0,0.0,155.0,70,26,572,56*,13.00,376,152.12,0,1,35,43,44.0,0.0,2.0,3,485,256,9.0,5/82,7/102,28.44,3.16,53.8,0,1,0,57.0,54,2833,1845,123.0,7/18,7/18,15.0,3.90,23.0,4,4,0,38.0,38,864,867,75.0,5/3,5/3,11.56,6.02,11.5,3,2,0,6.0,11,1664,783,44,8/74,12/122,17.79,2.82,37.8,1,5,1,59.0,56,2940,1933,127,7/18,7/18,15.22,3.94,23.1,4,4,0,155.0,154,3587,3644,237,5/3,5/3,15.37,6.09,15.1,5,2,0,False,False,False,False

Little more than 6ft tall, with a smooth and athletic run-up, his fast arm surprises batsmen and he has a natural full-of-a-length delivery, swinging the ball both ways at pace. A reasonable tailender and with excellent hands in the outfield, Hassan - softly spoken yet fiercely ambitious - represents the talent which exists in Afghanistan. \n"", ""The match at Lord's was a significant step for a bowler whose family fled the bombs of Jalalabad when he was six, and who subsequently learned the game in Peshawar where thousands of his countrymen sought refuge. His family, all of whom hated the game, did their best to encourage education but Hassan's determination - he played the game in secret for years - eventually won them over. He was first spotted when playing for Afghanistan in March 2006 in Mumbai when they defeated an MCC side led by Mike Gatting, where the then MCC president, Robin Marlar, noticed his potential, and was stunned to see him bowling in flat trainers. Hasan toured England with the national side in 2006, playing several matches against county second XIs, winning them all and was drafted onto MCC's groundstaff where he bowled against his hero, Andrew Flintoff, and was quick enough to smash Monty Panesar's helmet in the nets."", 'He ventured north to play for Norden CC in the Central Lancashire League the following year and represented Afghanistan in the 2009 World Cup Qualifiers, where his whippy action on a corrugated pitch earned him his first five-wicket haul, helping his side upset the tournament favourites Ireland.

It appears the only thing that might be able to limit Hassan's ambition is the frailty of his own body. In 2012 a knee injury necessitated two operations, and he missed out on the World T20 qualifying final against Ireland in 2013. When he's fit, he completes Afghanistan's varied bowling attack, and his pace, reverse swing and yorkers make him Associate cricket's most lethal bowler.""]",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,32.0,17,4,92.0,17,7.07,171,53.80,0,0,9,2,4,0,22.0,9,6,50.0,22,16.66,46,108.69,0,0,3,2,2.0,0.0,13.0,17,6,58,26,5.27,139,41.72,0,0,6,3,3,0,49.0,24,7,130,22,7.64,210,61.90,0,0,11,4,8.0,0.0,40.0,16,6,61,22,6.10,69,88.40,0,0,3,2,6.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,32.0,31,1518,1153,56.0,5/45,5/45,20.58,4.55,27.1,2,1,0,22.0,22,478,523,32.0,4/22,4/22,16.34,6.56,14.9,1,0,0,13.0,24,2500,1490,67,7/61,11/154,22.23,3.57,37.3,2,6,3,49.0,48,2378,1828,84,5/23,5/23,21.76,4.61,28.3,3,2,0,40.0,40,884,991,55,4/22,4/22,18.01,6.72,16.0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

Never one to quit, never one to know when he was beaten, Brown - desperate to prove himself one more time after falling from favour during Mark Greatbatch's ill-fated reign at the club - suffered a serious Achilles tendon injury in the field during a T20 match against Northants and was carried from the field for the last time only when it became obvious that there was simply no other choice. It was the only way it could have ended and the final act of an outstanding county career. \n"", ""Brown had first come to Warwickshire's attention as a fast bowler. Juggling his work as a PE teacher with his commitments as a cricketer with Scotland, it was far from unusual for Brown to travel overnight from his home in Stirling to undertake a trial or play a match, before making the long journey home the following night. Hard work was never an impediment for Brown.\n \nA junior player in Warwickshire's treble-winning season of 1994, he contributed more often in 1995 and then remained a key player for more than a decade. He was the leading wicket-taker in the country in 1997, exceeded 1,000 first-class runs in 2003 and averaged over 50 in 2004, the year his bowling played a huge role in Warwickshire's Championship success. With more than 500 first-class wickets and a batting average over 30, he was one of the leading all-rounders in domestic cricket for almost 10 years. His obvious commitment and determination made him a firm favourite at Edgbaston. "", 'He also enjoyed success at international level. In Sharjah in 1997, in the second of his nine ODIs for England, he bowled Philo Wallace with the first ball of the match and had Brian Lara leg before with the third. England, led by Adam Hollioake, went on to win the tournament. ', 'When England dispended of him, he represented Scotland in a further 16 ODIs and two T20Is. Already 36 before he made his international debut for the country of his birth, Brown still contributed in the 2007 Caribbean World Cup and the World T20 in South Africa later that year. He played one List A game (it was not an international) for Namibia, too, and coached them at the 2003 World Cup.', 'He continued to play wholeheartedly for Barnt Green in the Birmingham League until the end of 2012, but coaching was quickly becoming more important to Brown. Appointed as Academy coach at Edgbaston when his old friend Ashley Giles was appointed as director of cricket in 2009, Brown was promoted to assistant coach and then to director of cricket ahead of the 2013 season when Giles moved on to England. Warwickshire subsequently won the NatWest T20 Blast under Brown in 2014 and finished as runners-up in both the other competitions. ', 'Despite another trophy - the Royal London One Day Cup - in 2016, Brown was sacked by Warwickshire at the end of the season and replaced by his old friend, Giles.

Javed Omar is also the only Bangladeshi to have done so, in the country's first overseas Test, against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in 2001. The feat reflects patience and perseverance at the wicket, an element that often went missing for Bangladeshi openers in the first decade of being an elite cricket nation. But the man affectionately known as Golla was never a popular choice: he was maligned as being too slow and dour with his batting, but often did the job that was required of him - see off the new-ball and stabilise the top-order. \n"", ""Hailing from Bakshi Bazar in Old Dhaka, Omar grew up in a family where cricket and football ruled conversations. He preferred the cricket bat and ball, bowling leg-breaks and smashing cuts to the fence, and soon became a regular in the club cricket scene in the early 1990s. One-day cricket never suited Javed, whose batting was of the Trevor Bailey class in obduracy. When Test cricket came around, he wasn't the first-choice opener, with the more fluent but flaky Shahriar Hossain and Mehrab Hossain debuting before him. But his turn came in 2001 when he batted out Bangladesh's second innings in Bulayawo, making an unbeaten 85 after a slower half-century in the first innings."", 'A strong back-foot player with the knack of swiftly hacking and cutting anything short and wide, Javed was slow at building his innings but that was exactly what Bangladesh needed when they looked soft in the early days of Test cricket. His only Test century was a score of 119 against Pakistan in 2003, which gave Bangladesh their first first-innings lead in Tests. The innings came at the back of some low scores that had put him under pressure for a Test place.', 'He had four other Test fifties in Chittagong against Zimbabwe, South Africa, New Zealand and India, and also scored a gutsy 71 against England in Chester-Le-Street during the 2005 tour. He was the only Bangladesh batsman who understood the early summer conditions and made double-digit scores in all four innings.', 'Despite his shortcomings in one-day cricket, Javed managed ten half-centuries, including a sedate 81 off 150 balls against England at Headingley in 2005. He had played enough international cricket to come up with a faster 80 off 117 in 2007 against India just after the World Cup, during which he filled in for the out-of-form Shahriar Nafees in the opening position.', 'He ended his international career after playing against Sri Lanka that year, unable to earn a position in the subsequent series due to his inability to keep up with the pace of one-day cricket.

Putting in the long hours in training took Mashud, also known as 'Pilot', to great heights, including being the first name in the Bangladesh team sheet for more than a decade.

He was probably waiting for Bangladesh to begin playing Test cricket to fulfill his batting credentials, as the longer game suited him. He struck fifties against New Zealand, England and Zimbabwe, but the innings that typified his contribution was the three-hour-long 33 he made in East London in 2002 in Bangladesh's first Test on South African soil. He negotiated the likes of Makhaya Ntini and Nantie Hayward with guts, even as most of the others struggled. His only Test hundred, against West Indies in the drawn game at Gros Islet, was also to ensure Bangladesh safety in what was also his longest stay at the crease - five-and-a-half hours."", ""The only criticism of Mashud was his stint as captain. The 12 straight Test defeats wasn't his fault, but one of his low points was leading Bangladesh in the 2003 World Cup debacle, particularly the defeat against Canada the day before Eid ul Fitr.

Mushfiqur was principally selected as an understudy to the ever-present wicketkeeper, Khaled Mashud, but his inclusion was further evidence of Bangladesh's determination to build for a better future. He had done well on an A-team tour of Zimbabwe earlier in 2005, scoring a century in the first Test at Bulawayo, and also enjoyed some success in England the previous year with the Under-19s, making 88 in the second Test at Taunton. He showed more evidence of grit with the full team, with a maiden first-class half-century to soften the pain of defeat against Sussex, followed by a career-best 115 against Northamptonshire. That earned him a call-up - as a batsman - to become the youngest player to appear in a Test match at Lord's. He was one of only three players to reach double figures in a disappointing first innings, but a twisted ankle kept him out of the second Test. After captaining Bangladesh's Under-19s to fifth place in the Youth World Cup in February 2006, he also featured in Bogra's inaugural Test, against Sri Lanka the following month, but could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara.

His career hit the rocks shortly afterwards, when his bowling action was reported as suspect, but he bounced back in May 2003, with 6 for 77 against South Africa at Dhaka. It was the best bowling performance by a Bangladeshi in 19 Tests at the time - and only their third five-wicket haul - and it spurred Rafique on to greater things. Later in 2003 he was the leading wicket-taker in the series against England. He can bat a bit too, usually employing the long handle. His 77 at Hyderabad in May 1998 was instrumental in Bangladesh's victory over Kenya - surprisingly, their first in seven attempts - while in May 2004 he carved an astonishing 111 from No. 9 to help secure a precious first-innings lead against West Indies in St Lucia. His 5 for 65 helped Bangladesh win their first Test, against Zimbabwe at Chittagong early in 2005, and he also played a vital role in turning around the one-day series that followed. He was named Bangladesh's Cricketer of the Year for 2004-05, and survived a public training-ground argument with coach Dav Whatmore to play a role in the national side past his 36th birthday. Nine wickets as Bangladesh almost upset Australia at Fatullah in April 2006 edged him towards a notable double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in Tests. Against Zimbabwe in November, Rafique became the first Bangladesh player to complete that double in one-day internationals. He reluctantly announced his retirement in 2008 after being looked over for selection in to the one-day side. However he went off in style by becoming the first Bangladesh bowler to take 100 Test wickets in his final match against South Africa in Chittagong.

His on-field performances and off-field professionalism set a benchmark that was followed by peers and juniors alike. As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams. \n', 'The best of his ability and temperament were on display in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, when Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. In only his fourth Test as captain, Shakib scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton, performances that offered further proof of his skill and ability to handle pressure. Against the same opponents in 2008, Shakib took 7 for 36 in Chittagong, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking seven or more wickets in a Test innings.', ""In ODIs, Shakib's contributions have been equally vital with bat and ball and he became the first from Bangladesh to achieve the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. He also became the first batsman from Bangladesh to score five hundreds, despite mostly batting at No. 5."", ""Being clearly the best player in the team, it wasn't surprising when Shakib was handed the captaincy in 2009 after Mashrafe Mortaza repeatedly got injured during his first tenure. His ability to perform consistently and to stay calm under pressure worked well for Bangladesh, as they won 22 out of 47 games under him, and even beat England in the 2011 World Cup. However, the World Cup campaign was followed by a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a one-off Test and the ODI series, which led to Shakib's removal as captain."", 'His form hardly waned, however, as he quickly bounced back to help Bangladesh bowl out West Indies for 61 in an ODI; a hundred and five-for in the same Test - something he has done twice - followed later in the year. He remained consistent for Bangladesh and his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders, but in 2014 Shakib lapsed into off-field shenanigans that saw him fined for lewdly gesticulating at the camera from the dressing-room during an ODI against Sri Lanka, then suspended for six months by the BCB for misbehaving with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and threatening to quit Bangladesh duty. The ban was lifted early and Shakib made the vice-captain in the ODI and T20 formats under Mashrafe. His match-winning ability was undimmed and he played key roles in Bangladesh wins during their stellar 2015.

A middle-order batsman who relies on his eye as much as technique and who can attack or defend as the situation demands, he possesses a wide range of strokes, but when he is in full flow he can be a punishing player at any level. His bowling has gone from being medium-pace to a Chris Gayle-like gentle offspin, seemingly innocuous but deceptively effective in the one-day game.

He made 65 in their first game, against India at Cuttack, top-scored with a vital 29 in their sensational low-scoring victory over West Indies at Pune,  and contributed 96 against Sri Lanka at Kandy, establishing himself as his country's leading batsman.  This was further shown when he made a destructive 147 against Bangladesh in the 1997 ICC Trophy final, taking Kenya to a second successive World Cup, and new ODI status.  "", ""He again performed well in the 1999 World Cup, with fifties against India and England, and on taking over the captaincy in 2002 he immediately underlined his class by scoring 93 and 69 in that year's Champions Trophy. While he had a personally disappointing start to the World Cup in 2003, he came good with the bat and his contributions with the ball and astute captaincy helped Kenya to reach the semi-finals."", ""This performance, aided by Tikolo's burgeoning reputation, led to calls for Kenya to be granted Test status, but those coincided with a rapid disintegration of the game inside the country as the KCA fell out with the stakeholders.  After a wretched 2004 Champions Trophy, Tikolo quit as captain, weary from 18 months of battling his own board, and he was at the heart of a players' strike which followed and which, eventually, helped lead to the ousting of the old regime.

He made his international debut for Ireland as a 17-year-old in 2010. The accolade was made more remarkable by the fact that he had only been bowling spin for four years, having switched from bowling seam at the age of 13 after coach Brian O'Rourke spotted him bowling spin in a car park during an Ireland age group tour of Wales.  \n"", ""Dockrell immediately established himself as a key player in the Ireland side. He played a key role in Ireland's 2010 World Twenty20 campaign, blending nous with audacity as his flighted twirlers saw off Netherlands in the qualifying tournament before taking 3 for 16 against West Indies and choking England's middle-order with four overs for 19. School exams then prevented him facing Australia in an ODI but a month later he was offered a contract at Somerset, where he had had an association since the age of 15."", ""He made a big impact in just his second County Championship match, taking 6 for 27 to bowl Somerset to victory over Middlesex in their opening fixture of the 2012 season. He helped his side to another win later in the year with 6 for 29 against Durham as Somerset's finished runners-up again. He finished the season with 35 wickets at 28.45 but future seasons proved less successful and the Somerset coach at the time, Dave Nosworthy, suggested that his red-ball game was suffering through a surfeit of white ball cricket. Matt Maynard, Nosworthy's successor, seemed of similar mind, and Dockrell was released at the end of 2015 - ahead of a busy Ireland one-day summer the following year."", ""In 2012 he played in his second World T20 but after three overs of punishment in a bad-tempered defeat to Australia, Ireland's final group match was washed out and Dockrell didn't get a second chance to bowl. But his year ended on a better note when he was named the ICC Associate Player of the Year in 2012. A year later he booked his ticket back to the world stage by helping Ireland win the World T20 qualifier for Bangladesh 2014. That he was cramming in experience at a young age was further emphasised when Ireland qualified for the 2015 World Cup, but the prospect of a 10-team World Cup in England in 2019 left him as just one of many Ireland players with a sense of betrayal."", 'Dockrell learned his game at Leinster Cricket Club in Dublin and played age-group cricket for Ireland since Under-13s. He made his senior debut in 2010: a T20 against Afghanistan in Colombo, where he took 2 for 11; an ODI debut followed in the West Indies. He also captained Ireland Under-19s at the 2012 World Cup.

Joyce had switched to England when the 2007 World Cup took place, having helped Irelands through the qualifying tournament, and became the first Irishman in the modern game to play for England. But he did not quite achieve the career he had envisaged and switched back to Ireland just in time for the next tournament in 2011. He had not quite achieved the four-year qualification period, but the ICC recognised a persuasive case and gave him special dispensation.  \n', 'Joyce was born in Dublin, and from a large family with four brothers and four sisters. He was a star for Ireland at ICC Trophy level, scoring 758 runs in 14 matches between 2001 and 2005, at an average of 84.22. But he always had ambitions to play at the highest level and, after completing his English residency qualification in 2005, made his one-day debut against Ireland in 2006. The Irish team included his younger brother, Dominick. Two days later, he represented England in his first Twenty20 International, before missing a month with a sprained ankle. International cricket, though, had whet his appetite and upon his Championship return for Middlesex at Edgbaston he struck a career-best 211 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.', ""He seemed to cement his England place with good performances in Australia - the highlight being a century against Australia at the SCG and then against lesser opponents in the 2007 World Cup, although questions began to be raised about his fluency and he was discarded after England's dismal tournament. Joyce was an important part of Middlesex's middle-order for a decade from his debut in 1999, but his frustration at a stalled England career was evident and after an unhappy 2008 he severed his ties with Middlesex and moved south to Sussex where he became an influential member of the side without ever regaining his England place. "", ""He became Sussex captain in the middle of the 2012 season, succeeding Michael Yardy. He had an exceptional summer in 2014, hitting seven centuries and averaging 66 in the Division One of the Championship, outdone only by Yorkshire's Adam Lyth among regular performers.  The England selector Angus Fraser even suggested that, were Joyce still eligible, he would have been seriously considered as Alastair Cook's opening partner in the Test side. He resigned after Sussex were surprisingly relegated in 2015, leaving Luke Wright to pick up the role in all three formats. The advent of first-class cricket in Ireland left him unsure of his Sussex future at the end of 2016, a season in which he set a new career-best with a masterful 250 against Derbyshire in Derby."", ""An oddity in Joyce's career was a rare form of dismissal in a Championship game against Warwickshire in 2009 when he swept a ball from Ant Botha straight into the pocket of the fielder at short leg, Jonathan Trott, who was leaping to take evasive action at the time."", 'Once Joyce recognised his England career was over, without the Test debut he had craved, he made clear his intentions to return to an international career with Ireland. He was named in an Irish pre-World Cup touring squad in October 2010 - more than five years after his last outing for Ireland - and shortly afterwards was granted special dispensation by the ICC to represent his country of birth at the tournament in February 2011. He explained that he had been driven to qualify for England by his desire to play Test cricket - ""the pinnacle of the game"" - but that as a ""born and bred Irishman"" he was eager to contribute to Ireland\'s success if that chance of Test cricket eluded him.', ""He is one of five members of the Joyce family to represent Ireland.

He tore the heart out of the UAE batting line up in their second innings taking three for eight from his eight overs as Ireland recorded a morale-boosting victory by an innings and 170 runs. He led Ireland to a thrilling tie against Zimbabwe in their first match of the 2007 World Cup before beating Pakistan - Johnston hit the winning runs - to record one of the biggest upsets in history. \n"", ""In March 2008, at the age of 34, Johnston announced that he was taking an indefinite break from international cricket in order to recuperate and spend some time with his family, but returned for Ireland's Intercontinental Cup match against Canada five months later and was a vital member of the side - captained by William Porterfield - that reached its third successive Cup final.

His withdrawal from the 2015 World Cup because of a foot injury suffered in a training session in Dubai denied him the opportunity he had cherished and he also missed out on a potential appearance in World Twenty20 in India in 2016, this time of his own volition, when he retired from T20 internationals early in the 2015 season.

His skill was highlighted in Ireland's famous victory over England in Bangalore at the 2011 World Cup. Mooney took 4 for 63 in England's innings, restricting the batsmen at the death with cutters, yorkers and slower balls. But his contribution with the bat was even more significant. Mooney was clinical in clinching Ireland's win, finishing with 33 not out from 30 balls and hitting the winnings runs when he clipped Jimmy Anderson to the midwicket boundary.  \n"", ""Mooney made his ODI debut alongside his older brother Paul in Ireland's maiden ODI, against England in June 2006. He contributed with bat and ball, claiming the wickets of Marcus Trescothick, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood - though he conceded 79 from his ten overs - and then hit an unbeaten 30. But he was a peripheral player for Ireland in the 2007 World Cup, going wicketless in his two games. After the tournament, he took a break from international cricket to complete his electrical apprenticeship, but returned when he was qualified and was established as a regular in the Ireland team by the World Cup. "", ""In April 2013 he was suspended for three matches by Cricket Ireland for an insensitive tweet about the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The following February he left Ireland's tour of the West Indies and took a break from the game due a stress-related illness which had been managed for some time. In a highly revealing interview in September 2014, Mooney admitted the extent of his struggle with depression, saying that he had even contemplated committing suicide. The following day he made a sublime 96 against Scotland, marked by crisp late cuts, and the Malahide crowd were distraught that he just missed out on a maiden ODI century. But more important was that Mooney was enjoying cricket again and had proved his continuing worth in the Ireland side ahead of the 2015 World Cup. "", ""While Mooney's skills seem particularly well-suited to limited overs cricket he has also been a terrific performer for Ireland in the first-class game, and took match figures of 10 for 81 as Ireland beat Afghanistan in the final of the Intercontinental Cup in 2013. A product of a working-class North County upbringing, Mooney has admitted to not telling his friends that he played cricket as a child and has been used prominently in marketing by Cricket Ireland to expand the game's appeal.\n""]",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,64.0,55,14,963.0,96,23.48,1215,79.25,0,3,92,14,19.0,0.0,27.0,23,9,231.0,31*,16.50,214,107.94,0,0,25,1,13,0,17.0,24,6,723,107,40.16,1231,58.73,1,5,85,7,15.0,0.0,92.0,78,16,1344,96,21.67,1682,79.90,0,4,127,18,29.0,0.0,47.0,38,16,433,38,19.68,360,120.27,0,0,38,8,20,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,64.0,50,1797,1635,48.0,4/27,4/27,34.06,5.45,37.4,2,0,0,27.0,10,156,176,10.0,2/7,2/7,17.60,6.76,15.6,0,0,0,17.0,,1453,794,35,5/36,10/81,22.68,3.27,41.5,1,2,1,92.0,76,2721,2429,71,4/27,4/27,34.21,5.35,38.3,3,0,0,47.0,17,266,314,21,3/20,3/20,14.95,7.08,12.6,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

While Ireland have been disappointed by their lack of opportunities - they played fewer ODIs against Full Members from 2011 to 2015 than 2007 to 2011 - O'Brien has remained a formidable cricketer for them, and hit 84* from 47 balls to secure a tie against Pakistan in 2013.

Blessed with great height - Rankin is six feet, seven inches tall - he gained bounce from even the most sluggish of surfaces and claimed 12 wickets in the tournament to help his side to notable victories over Pakistan and Bangladesh. Five years later, he made himself unavailable for Ireland in a bid to play Test cricket with England. The move provoked disquiet in his home country but it appeared to have been justified when he was named in England's Ashes squad to tour Australia in 2013-14, after a series of impressive limited-overs displays for his adoptive country. Progress was fitful, though, and he restored his allegiance with Ireland as 2015 drew to a close. \n"", ""Having spent some time on the staff at Middlesex without ever making it into the first team, Rankin broke into the Derbyshire side on the back of his World Cup success and then moved to Warwickshire at the end of the 2007 season. Hampered by a succession of injuries, it wasn't until 2009 that, having put greater onus on strength and fitness, he began to fulfil his potential. In 2011 he was part of the Ireland side that defeated England in the World Cup game in Bangalore and then passed 50 first-class wickets in a county season for the first time. After one particularly hostile spell in which he struck Marcus Trescothick several times on the body, the Somerset opener praised Rankin for being as good a fast bowler as he faced that season. While consistency and fitness remained an issue, there was little doubt that, when the force was with him, Rankin had the pace, bounce and lateral movement to discomfort any batsman."", 'Rankin made his England Lions debut in 2011 against Sri Lanka A and was selected on the England Performance Programme later that same year. He came very close to being called-up to the Test squad at the start of 2012 when Chris Tremlett was forced out of the series in the UAE due to injury, but was unavailable due to fitness issues of his own.', 'After 37 ODIs and 15 T20Is, he retired from Irish cricket towards the end of 2012 in order to concentrate on winning a place in the England Test side. Having struggled to remain injury free, it was made clear to him that his body could not sustain the burden of playing all formats of the game for Ireland, Warwickshire and England Lions. It was also made clear to him by his then club coach, Ashley Giles, that he would not be guaranteed another county contract unless he committed to Warwickshire and England.', 'After impressing at the start of 2013, Rankin was called into the England squad for the ODI series against New Zealand following injuries to Stuart Broad and Steven Finn. In June that year he played his first game for England, a Twenty20 international against New Zealand. His England ODI debut followed shortly after, ironically in Dublin, where Rankin took a career-best 4 for 46 against his former country, and his returns during the one-day series with Australia were good enough to win him a place in the Ashes squad.', 'The tour did not go as he would have wished. Overlooked until the final Test, Rankin delivered a nervous performance on Test debut that raised questions about both his temperament and the environment within the England squad. He later revealed that he played the game carrying an injury. He was subsequently omitted from England World T20 squad, but thrown a lifeline latter in the year when he was recalled to the Lions squad for the tour of South Africa. It was a selection that ended any realistic hopes Ireland had of persuading him to return to them for the 2015 World Cup. They had, until then, retained hopes of the ICC providing special dispensation for a speedy return.', 'Rankin hails from a cricket-playing farming family in Londonderry.

Before his 23rd birthday, he had already hit two ODI centuries against Pakistan. With a natural swagger and belligerence allied to a portly build, Stirling has evoked comparisons with Jesse Ryder. He generates huge power with seemingly little effort and is particularly strong lashing the ball straight or pulling the ball over midwicket.  \n', ""Born in Belfast, Stirling made his ODI debut at the age of just 17. He played for Ireland in the World Twenty20 in England in 2009, and then signed a three-year contract with Middlesex in December 2009. The following year he gave further notice of his talent by thumping a 134-ball 177 for Ireland against Canada in Toronto - the highest ODI score made by an Irishman. While he struggled in the 2011 World Cup, he ended the tournament with 101 in Ireland's victory against the Netherlands, and a century in Ireland's ODI series against Pakistan in May 2011 had Waqar Younis purring. He added another against the same opponents in Ireland's tie with Pakistan two years later. Stirling also revealed his big match temperament with a pair of blistering innings - 79 off 38 balls and 76 off 43 balls - against Afghanistan in the finals of the World T20 qualifiers in 2012 and 2013. "", ""While Stirling made a fine impression for Middlesex in limited overs cricket, he languished in the second eleven in the Championship. But when he got a chance in 2014, he averaged 43.87 in six games, suggesting that he was capable of managing the transition between the white and red ball. Although he has been troubled by a back injury, which has limited his ability to bowl, Stirling is also a highly competent back-up offspinner. He has frequently bowled his full allocation of overs for Ireland in ODIs and, with 1-45 from ten overs, was Ireland's most economical bowled during their victory over England in Bangalore in the 2011 World Cup."", 'Stirling had long been a curious case in first-class cricket. The discrepancy between his first-class and limited overs returns for Middlesex had been infuriating. Before his maiden Championship hundred, he averaged 27.77 for the county against the red ball, but 41.46 in one-day cricket. So that century, against Yorkshire at Lord\'s in 2017, was a perfect celebration of Ireland\'s elevation to Test status which was formally confirmed on the other side of the Thames, at The Oval, a few days later. ""It\'s about time I did this and also about time I started to score more consistently. That said, I don\'t want to take away my natural instinct to play attacking cricket. That\'s the balance I have to find.""', 'Ireland were eagerly seeking to develop club standards as their status in international cricket grew but another century upon Stirling\'s return to play for his boyhood club, Cliftonville, caused brief resentment later that summer as rules excluded players with recent first-class experience from playing at this standard.  ""Farcical"" was how a tweet from Armagh described it after Stirling bulldozed their attack.

With an unforgettable 2005 Ashes series surrendering to unbearable tension on a Sunday morning at Edgbaston, his nerve held firm as he swooped to scoop a catch behind the wicket offered by Michael Kasprowicz, to seal the two-run victory that changed Ashes history. He recalled ""seeing it in slow motion,"" rolling over and seeing umpire Billy Bowden\'s finger going up before joining England\'s celebrations.', ""No player better encapsulated the fluctuating fortunes of that memorable series than Jones. Fast-tracked into the Test team at the expense of a superior gloveman, Chris Read, his selection was widely debated throughout the summer. England's coach Duncan Fletcher was a staunch advocate, Jones contributed energy to the cause and vital runs at key moments - none more important than his 85 in a stand of 177 with Andrew Flintoff at Trent Bridge - but he also produced enough fumbles for an edge to become a heart-in-the-mouth moment. He clung on to his place, however, and he also clung on to the chance that really mattered, emerging from the series more or less in credit - if not with his place secure."", ""Keeping wicket for Kent brings with it a certain weight of history. Ames, Evans, Knott, Downton, Marsh is a formidable backstory, but Jones has earned his place in the dynasty. By the time he moved to Gloucestershire for a last hurrah in the county game, he had established himself as an elder statesman of the Kent squad, and in James Tredwell's absences with England in 2013 he was a natural selection as stand-in captain.  In 15 seasons with the club he made 14 hundreds and took more than 450 dismissals in 150 first-class appearances, in addition to his 34 Test caps."", 'Born in Papua New Guinea to Welsh parents, Jones lived and learned his cricket in Australia until he was 22. He was almost 27 when he first came to the attention of the England selectors, but he had timed his run to perfection.', ""In the 2003 season - Alec Stewart's last - Jones scored the best part of 1000 runs at an average of more than 50. After a brief stint at Glamorgan, he had moved to Kent, whose supporters are connoisseurs of fine keeping, but his weight of runs in the 2nd XI became a major factor in Paul Nixon's controversial return to Leicestershire."", ""Jones was rewarded with a call-up to England's Test squad to tour West Indies, and after displacing Read behind the stumps in the fourth and final Test in Antigua, he cemented his place with a thrilling century against New Zealand at Headingley, where his sixth-wicket alliance with Flintoff had England fans rubbing their hands with glee. His counterpunching style remained seemingly well designed for a momentum-seizing half-century, but he had many critics and he managed just two fifties in ten Tests before being dropped in favour of Read in August 2006."", 'He regained the No. 1 slot for the 2006-07 Ashes - a controversial choice - and, after three unproductive Tests, Fletcher was forced to hand the gloves back to Read. The emergence of Matt Prior in 2007 and the replacement of Fletcher, with Peter Moores (another coach with wicketkeeping experience) taking over, he slipped down the pecking order.', 'Jones, who is a fully trained pharmacy technician, never seriously threatened to regain his England place but the winter of 2006-7 was not quite the end of his international adventures: five years later, he played for Papua New Guinea in the ICC World Twenty20 qualifiers, which took place in Dubai.', ""An unexpected Lord's final enabled him to retire with his virtues heralded. His shrewd half-century was a vital facet in Gloucestershire's Royal London Cup victory against Surrey. It was a send-off that Jones could hardly have envisaged. The emergence of Sam Billings at Kent had encouraged him to accept a two-year term as Gloucestershire's four-day captain, but by the middle of his second season he had stepped down, feeling that, at 39, his presence had become a hindrance to the development of a young side under the supervision of a new head coach, Richard Dawson. Barely a week after he had made his decision, Iain Cockbain, the new captain, suffered a broken wrist while batting in the nets at Cheltenham. And, as Dawson succinctly put it, Gloucestershire responded by putting another token in the coin-op, as Jones won what turned out to be a glorious recall. After retirement, he took up a post as cricket professional at Brentwood School in Essex.\n"", '\n']",['Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005'],34.0,53,4,1172.0,100,23.91,2165,54.13,1,6,155,12,128.0,5.0,51.0,43,8,862.0,80,24.62,1117,77.17,0,4,74,14,68.0,4.0,2.0,2,1,33.0,19,33.00,25,132.0,0,0,5,0,2,0,203.0,309,29,9087,178,32.45,,,15,50,,,599.0,36.0,213.0,176,33,3679,87,25.72,4484,82.04,0,17,,,209.0,42.0,127.0,100,19,1529,56,18.87,1333,114.70,0,3,121,44,55,26,34.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,51.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,2.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,203.0,,24,26,0,-,-,-,6.50,-,0,0,0,213.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

A naturally talented allrounder, he had never been seriously coached until joining up with the Dutch squad. Borren earned that nickname 'Baldrick' from his team-mates - after the character in Blackadder - and is a chirpy presence in the field. Although his medium pace was taken apart on his ODI debut against Sri Lanka, as he picked up 1 for 94 from his 10 overs, his performances in the World Cricket League in Kenya where he averaged 21.25 in his three games proved enough to earn him a place at the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean. In the same year Borren showed his allround ability when he narrowly missed out on a maiden one-day international hundred, getting out stumped for 96 against Canada in Toronto. That confident innings must surely have owed something to Netherlands' thrilling last-ball win over England in the opening match of the ICC World Twenty20 at Lord's a month before. Borren played an important role in that famous win, snapping up the wicket of Eoin Morgan and then cracking a 25-ball 30 that included a monstrous six off Paul Collingwood in the course of a 50-run partnership with Tom de Grooth that tilted the game for Netherlands. In January 2010 Borren was part of the first group of Netherlands players to be awarded central contracts - a vital step in the professionalisation of the game at Associate level - and was appointed captain of the national side for the World Cricket League Division One tournament in July 2010."", '\n', ' \n']",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,58.0,50,5,1004.0,96,22.31,1176,85.37,0,5,84,19,28.0,0.0,43.0,38,5,638.0,57,19.33,524,121.75,0,1,60,18,28,0,27.0,50,1,1331,109,27.16,2239,59.44,2,5,151,17,40.0,0.0,153.0,136,20,2746,115,23.67,3235,84.88,2,12,232,53,72.0,0.0,63.0,55,10,863,57,19.17,721,119.69,0,1,72,26,38,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,58.0,51,1979,1620,46.0,4/32,4/32,35.21,4.91,43.0,1,0,0,43.0,30,526,603,18.0,2/19,2/19,33.50,6.87,29.2,0,0,0,27.0,41,3197,1652,41,4/1,4/1,40.29,3.10,77.9,1,0,0,153.0,124,4575,3888,106,4/32,4/32,36.67,5.09,43.1,1,0,0,63.0,49,832,956,31,3/14,3/14,30.83,6.89,26.8,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

In a career that had its primordial roots in age-group cricket in the late 1980s and came to an end more than twenty years later, Smits' captaining of the side to a thrilling last-ball win over England in the opening match of the 2009 World Twenty20 at Lord's is undoubtedly a career high. He had been 12th man in 1989 when Netherlands beat an England XI that included Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart - although that victory had something to do with the night before - but his chirpy presence was a constant in the field on that famous night at Lord's.  \n"", ""For a long time, Smits struggled to break into the side with Reinout Scholte keeping him out, but when Scholte retired he made the wicketkeeper's place all his own, and soon took over as a strong and inspirational captain. He possessed a steady pair of hands and was an excellent motivator in the field, although critics were quick to point out his limitations with the bat.  A popular member of the squad, he had plenty of tricks up his sleeve in the dressing room and was constantly initiating banter, although with nicknames such as Piglet, he took as much as he gave. In a typically unselfish move, Smits opted to call time on his career in October 2009.

Most notable in a long-standing career were two centuries at the 2011 World Cup, including an exhilarating 119 that almost stunned England. Reflecting his dominance, he won the ICC Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year Award three times between 2008 and 2011. Ten Doeschate also played five years for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL - the first Associate player to gain such a contract. \n', 'Born in South Africa, ten Doeschate cited Jonty Rhodes as his hero, and has played for Western Province. He is of Dutch descent, though, enabling him to represent Netherlands and qualify under the European Citizenship law to play county cricket. With his huge hitting, skiddy bowling and big smile, he soon became a cult figure at Essex, where he has played for more than a decade. ', 'The rise in Twenty20 leagues around the world came at a particularly good time for ten Doeschate. His combination of belligerent hitting, particularly to the leg side, and canny medium-pace have earned lucrative contracts not only in the IPL but also in Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe. But after the 2011 World Cup, ten Doeschate appeared to lose interest in playing for the Netherlands, missing the 2012 and 2014 World Twenty20s.', ""Ten Doeschate's first-class batting average is in the high 40s and if he has cause for disappointment it is that his bowling has not developed as much as he would have liked, but whatever his achievements in the longer form of the game, he will always be viewed as a Twenty20 specialist. There were few players more immediately suited to the advent of the shorter form of the game and he invites the question how many more T20 stars exist beyond the main Test nations. "", 'Essex spotted ten Doeschate playing for Western Province on a tour of South Africa in 2003. For a time, Gooch was his regular airport runner so he could play club cricket in Holland at a weekend. The following season, the second season of T20 in England, he signed full professional forms and gradually proved himself one of the finest Essex players of his era.', 'Success for Essex was frustratingly evasive during his career, and he was in the later stages of his career when he was appointed captain in succession to James Foster in 2016. Alongside a new coach, Chris Silverwood, he immediately led Essex back into Division One of the Championship, leading by example by averaging 64 with the bat with four hundreds and suitably scoring the runs that won promotion. He accepted a new two-year contract as he looked forward to first division life.', 'At 37, Essex finally brought fulfilment as he led them to their first Championship for 25 years - and first-ever, incidentally, without his old chauffeur, Gooch. Ten Doeschate suggested Essex had killed the ""myth"" that there was a huge gap between Divisions One and Two and remarked that ""people make too much of a deal about cricket captaincy."" But alongside the coaching pair of Silverwood and Anthony McGrath he built a culture at Essex that landed a punch for the smaller, non-Test counties. By then he could call himself ""Essex through and through"" and not hear a murmur of dissent.', 'Essex failed to defend their title, but at least ten Doeschate had the satisfaction of spearheading a victory in the last match of the 2018 season to prevent Surrey going unbeaten through the season, his unbeaten half-century bringing a nerve-tingling one-wicket victory that showed the Championship could still provide moments of high drama.', '\n']","['ICC Associate Player of the Year 2008, 2010, ']",0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,33.0,32,9,1541.0,119,67.0,1757,87.70,5,9,130,29,13.0,0.0,13.0,13,6,300.0,56,42.85,229,131.0,0,1,15,10,4,0,174.0,256,38,10283,259*,47.16,,,27,48,,,110.0,0.0,219.0,183,55,5826,180,45.51,,,11,30,,,67.0,0.0,332.0,294,66,6677,121*,29.28,4944,135.05,2,28,412,283,123,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,33.0,33,1580,1327,55.0,4/31,4/31,24.12,5.03,28.7,3,0,0,13.0,10,210,245,13.0,3/23,3/23,18.84,7.0,16.1,0,0,0,174.0,,10910,7172,212,6/20,,33.83,3.94,51.4,7,7,0,219.0,,5457,5241,173,5/50,5/50,30.29,5.76,31.5,6,1,0,332.0,139,2147,2922,114,4/24,4/24,25.63,8.16,18.8,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

But it is as a batsman that he has really developed, and his calmness at the crease and ability to penetrate gaps in the field has made him a most effective player in all forms of the game.  After coming through youth teams - he played for Canada's Under-19s when only 15 and went on to captain them - he made his debut for the full side in 1999-2000 when still only 17 and in 2001 was a key member of the side which finished third in the I CC Trophy, thus gaining a place at the 2003 World Cup. That tournament was a personal disappointment for Bagai with the bat, if not the gloves, but he developed well with solid rather than spectacular contributions with the bat. All that changed in the World Cricket League in Nairobi in early 2007 when scored 137 not out - his first hundred in senior cricket - against Scotland and added a second ton against Ireland four days later. His 345 runs at 86.25 meant he ended the tournament as the leading run scorer and was named Player of the Tournament. He was then named captain for Canada's Intercontinental Cup Final against Ireland in May. Consistent performances led him to be shortlisted for the inaugural ICC Associate ODI Player of the Year in 2007.  But his career appeared to hit a wall with a decision to take a job in the UK later in 2007, making him unavailable, though he maintained good form and became an increasingly reliable batsman when he did play.

He was more prolific in the Guyanese domestic competition, with a top score of 152* for Berbice against Demerara.  \n', ""He subsequently moved to Canada and was first picked for them in 2004 as an allrounder, adding slow left-arm spin to his batting.

In one-day matches his bowling has become increasingly useful, and he took 4 for 10 against Bermuda in the 2007 World Cricket League. He was named captain for Canada's Intercontinental Cup matches against Kenya and Namibia in October 2007, when Ashish Bagai was ruled out because of work commitments. He was also part of Canada's squad for the World Cup that year and although he, like the rest of the team, struggled in the competition, he did pick his caught-and-bowled dismissal of Kevin Pietersen as a particular career highlight. To cap a productive year, Dhaniram also cracked his maiden first-class century, reaching 141* as Canada beat UAE by an innings and 228 runs at King City. "", ""Dhaniram enjoyed a prolific year with the ball in 2008, picking up his third five-wicket haul for Canada in a limited-overs match against Bermuda and picking up 26 wickets across all formats - though he struggled to be incisive against major opposition. Nevertheless, he remained a consistent allround performer for Canada and in 2009 was one of six players to receive central contracts. He is currently Canada's second highest run-scorer in one-day internationals behind Ashish Bagai, and has identified the 2011 World Cup as his final engagement for the national side. If he enjoys a decent run at the event, he could well become the second Canadian player to pass 1,000 ODI runs, and with 41 ODI wickets to his name he is also likely to finish his career as Canada's leading wicket-taker in the format.

A promising talent at school level, he made his first-class debut - opening the batting in the first innings - for Mashonaland A at the age of 15. In 2004, Utseya was unexpectedly thrust into the Zimbabwe national team against Sri Lanka at the age of 19 when the rebel players withdrew. He held onto a place in a weakened national side and, somewhat surprisingly, took up the captaincy from Terry Duffin in 2006. \n', ""Utseya came of age with the ball during the tour to West Indies in May 2006, where his flight and spin belied his lack of experience and years. But there weren't a great deal of happy memories for Zimbabwe in the years that followed and Utseya tendered his resignation as national captain after the side's disappointing performance at the World Twenty20 in May 2010, saying that he was stepping down in the interest of the team's future development."", 'As it turned out, the move also allowed Utseya to focus on his own development. He formed a useful spin-bowling partnership with Ray Price, the pair making an odd, yet effective, couple and even opening the bowling together when conditions warranted it. Utseya honed his game as a limited-overs cricketer, his parsimonious bowling combining with surprisingly agile fielding and a can-do batting attitude to make him an automatic pick for Zimbabwe in ODIs and a senior member of the squad. He became the second Zimbabwean to take an ODI hat-trick in the course of his 5 for 36 against South Africa in August 2014, and later in the same series sealed his place in Zimbabwean cricketing folklore when he hit Mitchell Starc for a towering six to take Zimbabwe to their first ODI victory over Australia in 31 years.', ""His career hit a major hurdle shortly afterwards, when his action was deemed illegal and he was barred from bowling the offspin that had made him Zimbabwe's most reliable one-day bowler. Utseya was forced to take drastic action, trimming an already minimal bowling action down to its absolute bare bones and remodeling himself as a bowler of slow-medium cutters.\n""]",[],4.0,8,1,107.0,45,15.28,229,46.72,0,0,12,1,2.0,0.0,164.0,132,48,1406.0,68*,16.73,2410,58.34,0,4,88,17,50.0,0.0,35.0,21,9,94.0,13*,7.83,115,81.73,0,0,6,1,6.0,0.0,82.0,137,9,2756,115*,21.53,6515,42.30,1,15,,,33.0,0.0,243.0,193,60,2092,68*,15.72,,,0,5,,,77.0,0.0,84.0,55,24,367,41*,11.83,420,87.38,0,0,21,9,24.0,0.0,4.0,6,753,410,10.0,3/60,5/192,41.0,3.26,75.3,0,0,0,164.0,160,8571,6239,133.0,5/36,5/36,46.9,4.36,64.4,2,1,0,35.0,35,749,858,26.0,3/25,3/25,33.00,6.87,28.8,0,0,0,82.0,,14284,6509,217,7/56,,29.99,2.73,65.8,8,8,2,243.0,,12220,8683,214,5/36,5/36,40.57,4.26,57.1,4,1,0,84.0,84,1818,1984,75,4/12,4/12,26.45,6.54,24.2,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

A tall seam bowler, he hits the pitch hard and can get good away movement - but as with many young quick bowlers consistency is his major problem. Technically, he has a good action but a better brace of his front leg through his delivery stride would allow him to make the most of his height, rather than collapsing as he tends to do at the moment. He made his ODI debut against England in October 2004 and caused the England top-order a few anxious moments. His early Test appearances did not set the world alight, and he lost his place after taking 3 for 343 in four matches - but he has the basics and anyone with a semblance of talent should be encouraged and nurtured. Mpofu has benefited noticeably from Heath Streak's appointment as Zimbabwe's bowling coach as his action has smoothed out, his outswing is becoming more consistent (although he still has a frustrating propensity to go too wide of off stump) and his pace has increased. One definite shortcoming, however, is his crease occupation. Not content with being stumped twice in an afternoon (for a pair) in the first Test against New Zealand in August 2005, he followed up by being run out for 3 in the second match, as he strolled down the pitch to congratulate his team-mate on reaching his half-century.  He still tends to blow hot and cold and has few rivals in the race to be considered international cricket's worst batsman, but when Zimbabwe return to Test cricket Mpofu will have an important role to play. \n"", ' \n']",[],15.0,28,10,105.0,33,5.83,249,42.16,0,0,7,5,4.0,0.0,80.0,39,19,46.0,6,2.3,198,23.23,0,0,1,0,11.0,0.0,24.0,7,4,16.0,6*,5.33,30,53.33,0,0,0,1,5.0,0.0,104.0,161,44,1154,57,9.86,3495,33.01,0,1,,,26.0,0.0,178.0,93,42,404,41,7.92,863,46.81,0,0,,,31.0,0.0,71.0,29,15,121,27*,8.64,154,78.57,0,0,6,1,15.0,0.0,15.0,23,2489,1392,29.0,4/92,5/123,48.0,3.35,85.8,2,0,0,80.0,79,3767,3407,88.0,6/52,6/52,38.71,5.42,42.8,2,1,0,24.0,24,515,755,20.0,3/16,3/16,37.75,8.79,25.7,0,0,0,104.0,,16635,8598,280,7/37,,30.70,3.10,59.4,8,10,0,178.0,,8317,6709,229,6/8,6/8,29.29,4.83,36.3,7,3,0,71.0,70,1499,1906,69,4/17,4/17,27.62,7.62,21.7,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

As a teenager, he put together knocks of 94 against Southerns, an unbeaten 79 against Westerns and 52 not out against Northerns in the 2006-07 Faithwear Inter-Provincial One-Day Competition. He was then part of the Zimbabwe Under-19 team's dire trip to the Youth World Cup in early 2008, but his performances there and subsequently didn't suggest an outstanding talent, and an abductor injury upon his return to Zimbabwe was another set-back. \n \nMire's fortunes began to change when he emigrated to Australia in 2012. As something of a nomadic Grade cricketer, he spent some time in country Victoria and then moved on to Premier Cricket in Melbourne, where he played for Carlton and Essendon while also spending time in Darwin during the winter. He made community paper headlines in July 2014 when he slammed a 157-ball 260, including 21 sixes, for Waratahs to set a new tournament record in the Darwin and District Cricket Competition. His exploits for Essendon in the Victoria Cricket Association Premiership had also led to a game for Victoria Under-23s, and then a handful of games for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League in 2013-14 as a community rookie. Zimbabwe eventually came calling, and Mire cobbled together a pair of fifties in unfamiliar conditions in his debut series in Bangladesh in late 2014.

Matsikenyeri is a short, wristy batsman with a low centre of gravity and a fierce cut shot, and is also a useful part-time offspinner. He learned his cricket in the black township of Highfield on the outskirts of Harare, representing Zimbabwe at U-16 and U-19 levels, and has also played club cricket in Australia - a vital step in his development.\n \nHis debut came as an opening batsman against Pakistan at Bulawayo in November 2002. He played one match in the 2003 World Cup, and played in the NatWest Series in England later that year, scoring a vital 44 at Trent Bridge in a four-wicket win. But he has failed to really push on after the early promise and has struggled against high quality pace bowling, despite being strong on the cut and pull. He is an impressive fielder in a variety of positions but is generally used in the gully area.\n \nIn 2006 he declined to sign a new contract with the board, but, like several others, subsequently returned to the fold as the lure of a World Cup outings grew closer. He stayed there and thereabouts for Zimbabwe, but his chances in the national side diminished as did his returns with the bat. There were some bright points - such as his record 188-run sixth wicket partnership against South Africa with Tatenda Taibu in 2009, but in 2013 Matsikenyeri, who was captain of Mashonaland Eagles at the time, followed Taibu into premature retirement. He left Zimbabwe for Johannesburg, where he played league cricket and coached at a prestigious high school, and surprised many when he returned to Zimbabwe to fight for a place at the 2015 World Cup.

This was against West Indies in 2000-01 when, batting at No. 3 instead of his normal opening position, he scored a composed 119 that was largely responsible for Zimbabwe saving the match after conceding a first-innings lead of 216. Earlier in the year he had not only become the youngest Zimbabwean ever to score a first-class century, but also the first black player in Zimbabwe to do so - a watershed moment in the country's history.\n \nA year later, though, he put his professional cricket career on hold as he began a three-year course at the University of the Free State. Although an agreement was reached that he would still be available for Zimbabwe if required, he could not maintain his form playing against club opposition in South Africa, and the national selectors initially decided to await his return to the country. But the Rebel crisis led to his early recall in the one-dayers against England where, unsurprisingly, he struggled before registering his maiden ODI fifty in the final game. His return to the Test match team brought mixed results, but he was Zimbabwe's best batsman, technically, on their tour of South Africa, where he showed an application lacking in his team mates.\n \nAfter being criticised for not being able to score quickly enough early on in his career, Masakadza's ability in one-day cricket has steadily increased and 2009 was a bumper year for him. He scored over 1000 runs in ODIs in the calendar year at an average of 43.48 and a strike rate of 88.08, including scores of 156 and 178 not out in the home series against Kenya, the first time a batsman has made 150 or more twice in the same one-day series.\n \nMasakadza was part of Zimbabwe's XI when they played their first Test in six years, against Bangladesh in August 2011, scoring his second Test century a decade after his first. He has continued to show greater dexterity as a batsman, adding a hook and pull to a repertoire that already included muscular play off the front foot. He has also added value to Zimbabwe's set-up as a calm, amiable presence amid sometimes tempestuous times. Masakadza entered the peak of his career after turning 30, and was finally rewarded with a trip to a World Cup in 2015 - remarkably, his first."", '  \n']",[],38.0,76,2,2223.0,158,30.04,5009,44.38,5,8,264,23,29.0,0.0,204.0,203,4,5604.0,178*,28.16,7618,73.56,5,34,577,86,71.0,0.0,58.0,58,2,1516.0,93*,27.07,1295,117.06,0,10,139,58,20.0,0.0,140.0,251,11,9564,208*,39.85,,,23,44,,,124.0,0.0,339.0,337,22,10457,178*,33.19,,,9,70,,,139.0,0.0,122.0,121,15,3812,162*,35.96,3005,126.85,4,28,314,159,52.0,0.0,38.0,24,1164,489,16.0,3/24,3/24,30.56,2.52,72.7,0,0,0,204.0,84,1826,1622,39.0,3/39,3/39,41.58,5.32,46.8,0,0,0,58.0,9,72,113,2.0,1/4,1/4,56.50,9.41,36.0,0,0,0,140.0,,4130,1831,62,4/11,,29.53,2.66,66.6,,0,0,339.0,,3308,2812,86,4/36,4/36,32.69,5.10,38.4,3,0,0,122.0,29,336,380,19,2/6,2/6,20.00,6.78,17.6,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

But he recovered to become an aggressive opening or middle-order batsman who favoured the leg side. He also showed outstanding improvisational skills in the one-day game, and gained great kudos in Zimbabwe in February 2001 by twice lapping low off-side full-tosses from Glenn McGrath over his shoulder for four in the final over of a Perth one-dayer when 14 were needed (Zimbabwe lost by one run). He repeated the shot with devastating effect in a famous one-day victory over India at Faridabad in 2001-02. An occasional offspinner who gets more bounce than turn, he made an unexpected mark as a bowler in the fourth ODI against England at Bulawayo in October 2001, when he came on at 95 for 0 and stopped the rot by singlehandedly removing the top four in the order. He was also known to keep wicket. Marillier quit Zimbabwe cricket at the end of March 2004, disillusioned and angry, like so many before him, and after trying his luck as a professional in England, he opted to concentrate on his family's real estate business. After a break of more than five years, Marillier returned to Zimbabwe cricket in early 2010, signing up for the Mashonaland Eagles franchise and, somewhat surprisingly, being named in a provisional squad for Zimbabwe's tour of the West Indies in March. \n"", ' February 2010 \n']",[],5.0,7,1,186.0,73,31.0,437,42.56,0,2,16,2,2.0,0.0,48.0,41,4,672.0,100,18.16,949,70.81,1,3,62,7,12.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,41.0,71,4,2611,202,38.97,,,7,14,,,39.0,0.0,93.0,84,7,1895,117,24.61,,,3,9,,,27.0,0.0,6.0,6,0,109,74,18.16,110,99.09,0,1,8,2,0.0,0.0,5.0,6,616,322,11.0,4/57,6/96,29.27,3.13,56.0,2,0,0,48.0,35,1574,1235,30.0,4/38,4/38,41.16,4.70,52.4,1,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,41.0,,3407,2131,56,4/44,,38.05,3.75,60.8,,0,0,93.0,,2910,2297,56,4/38,4/38,41.01,4.73,51.9,1,0,0,6.0,3,42,40,2,2/11,2/11,20.00,5.71,21.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

With form, fitness and greener pastures overseas clearing away much of his fast-bowling competition, Panyangara played for Zimbabwe much more regularly in the seasons that followed. He settled into his role as one of the team's senior seamers with aplomb and was known as a lighthearted presence in the dressing room. \n \nPanyangara grew up in Marondera, a country town about 45 miles south-east of Harare, and learned his cricket at the local primary school - Godfrey Huggins.

He was reappointed to the role in 2002 but again found himself in the spotlight as the Zimbabwe side disintegrated in the wake of the country's internal turmoil. He was criticised for not taking a firmer political stand, and the\nsubsequent protest by Henry Olonga and Andy Flower further weakened his\nstanding. He again burdened the bowling - and the batting - in Zimbabwe's disappointing tour of England in 2003.

He wrote the exam that got him into Air Force college. He was one of 60 to have won a place among 60,000 applicants. But in his third year, he failed an eye test. He was told that 7 out of 10 people have the problem in normal life, but for him a dream was shattered.', 'Not dissuaded, Sikandar got admitted to Glasgow Caledonian University, where he picked up cricket as a semi-professional. He moved to Zimbabwe, where his parents had resided since 2002, and he made his first-class debut in 2007. He made one half-century in nine innings before completing his studies and returning to full-time cricket in the 2010-11 season. He had a more fruitful time, scoring 625 runs at an average of 41.', 'The following season was again decent as he developed a reputation as an aggressive top-order batsman. Sikandar kept doing well in the one-day and Twenty20 competitions at the time, so it was natural for the selectors to turn to him for a practice match against the visiting Bangladeshis in 2011 when Vusimuzi Sibanda was injured. He did well, and it became clear that he had a future in Zimbabwe colours.', ""Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) began a process to get him the necessary papers that would qualify him to play for the country and in May 2013, he made his international debut for Zimbabwe, in the first ODI against Bangladesh, thus becoming the 116th player to appear for Zimbabwe in the format. Four months later, he made his Test debut too, against Pakistan in Harare. By the time the 2015 World Cup rolled around, Sikandar was firmly settled into his role as the most adventurous batsman in Zimbabwe's top order, with a fondness for carving the ball through - and sometimes over - point, and a useful side line as an offspinner. "", ""He played a pivotal role in one of Zimbabwe's most memorable moments on a cricket field, winning the deciding ODI against Sri Lanka with a crucial cameo in a pressure situation chasing 204 on a turning track in Hambantota in July 2017.

Like them, he comes from the Harare township of Highfield and earned a ZCU scholarship to Churchill High School. Sibanda is an opening batsman and an occasional medium-pace bowler, and was a student at the CFX Academy in 2002. He scored 58 on debut against the West Indies, but his selection for the national team came too early, and despite failing to live up to his potential, the crisis in the national side meant that he kept his place long after others would have been discarded. Despite being a superb timer of the ball off both the front and back feet, he was slow to learn the ability to build a big innings and his selections were due almost entirely to his outstanding potential rather than actual performance. He has a very sound technique, but poor shot selection has often brought about his downfall. Coach Kevin Curran noted that he matured well on the West Indian tour in May 2006. He suffered a hand injury early on, but took his opportunities when given them, starting the tour with 52 at Georgetown, and finishing with a 78 and then a superb century in the Tri-Series final against Bermuda.  \n', ""He had a successful club season in Sydney, Australia, which seemed to have paid dividends when he registered scores of 47, 93 not out, and 64 in the home series against Bangladesh in February 2007. He could not carry this form into the World Cup, however, and his only innings of note in the tournament was 67 in Zimbabwe's tied game against Ireland at Kingston. He returned to Australian club cricket after the World Cup amid questions over his commitment to international cricket, but subsequently returned to Zimbabwe and was selected for the Afro-Asia Cup, making some impressive starts without being able to push on for a big score. He narrowly missed out on a first ODI hundred against a Test-playing nation when he was run out for 96 against the West Indies in Bulawayo in December 2007, and remained in contention for the national side thereafter with the odd good innings. "", 'Sibanda seemed to have fully matured as a batsman during the 2009-10 Zimbabwean domestic season. He was named as captain of the Midwest Rhinos and called up for the Zimbabwe XI to take on Kenya in the Intercontinental cup game at Kwekwe. Responding superbly, he rescued the Zimbabweans with 209 in the first innings and sealed the victory with an unbeaten 116 in the second. This marked the beginning of a rich vein of form for Sibanda, and he rocketed to the top of the domestic first-class batting tables. Before the end of the Logan Cup, he had taken his season tally to almost 1500 runs at an average of 95 with nine hundreds, including a career-best 215. Tellingly, only once did he pass fifty and fail to reach a hundred. With statistics like those, it is hard to see how he can be left out of the national side, and will likely play a major role should Zimbabwe return to Test cricket in the near future. \n', ' January 2010']",[],14.0,28,0,591.0,93,21.1,1177,50.21,0,2,86,6,16.0,0.0,127.0,126,4,2994.0,116,24.54,4716,63.48,2,21,328,35,42.0,0.0,26.0,26,1,511.0,59,20.44,503,101.59,0,1,52,11,12.0,0.0,134.0,245,12,7695,217,33.02,,,18,33,,,157.0,0.0,250.0,244,13,6006,190,26.00,,,4,39,,,92.0,0.0,72.0,72,7,1584,70*,24.36,1521,104.14,0,8,136,44,29.0,0.0,14.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,11,267,265,3.0,1/12,1/12,88.33,5.95,89.0,0,0,0,26.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,134.0,,2843,1726,39,5/55,,44.25,3.64,72.8,1,1,0,250.0,,809,775,10,2/50,2/50,77.50,5.74,80.9,0,0,0,72.0,3,15,33,0,-,-,-,13.20,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

The gap between appearances - 22 years and 222 days - is a record.

And the speed of his reactions fielding in the gully  would have shamed many half his age. In Zimbabwe's inaugural Test he took 5 for 86 in 50 overs.

Taylor, disillusioned with international cricket, signed a three-year Kolpak deal with Nottinghamshire which made him ineligible to play for Zimbabwe while that contract is in effect. He made his decision slightly open-ended, not entirely ruling out the possibility that he might one day return to the fold. And he did just that. \n"", '""I was concerned about the future of Zimbabwe cricket and with the administration side of it. I felt people were not qualified enough to run Zimbabwe cricket officially and just the way we were treated as players. It was really difficult to try and play the best cricket you could and deal with the issues.""', 'Those who doubted that he would ever return were proved wrong midway through his final season at Notts when he gained permission for an early release, citing homesickness: his wife Kelly had remained in Zimbabwe with their four young sons. He had a more optimistic attitude towards Zimbabwe cricket, too, anticipating that affairs would be better run on and off the field. At 31, he returned to Test cricket, against West Indies in Bulawayo, nearly three years after his previous innings.', 'Since making his debut in April 2004, Taylor was involved in almost every ODI - the format Zimbabwe play most often - his country has taken part in. In 2008, he missed out on 17 ODIs after making himself unavailable because of a dispute with the board and a year before that he was dropped for the last match of a series in Bangladesh and the return home series because of poor form. But, by and large, 216 matches across all formats (167 of them ODIs with a batting average of 34.82) told its own story.', '\nBut Taylor fell out with Stephen Mangongo, an uncompromising Zimbabwe coach. Firstly, he was stripped off the captaincy in July 2013 when Zimbabwe Cricket suffered one of its regular restructurings and the leadership was split with Elton Chigumbura assuming control in the limited-overs formats. He later relinquished the wicketkeeping role because Mangongo asserted that he preferred ""the best man for the job, not a part-timer"". Finally, in August 2014, he was dropped against South Africa when few anticipated such a move. ""It\'s a professional sport, there is always pressure. It is not Boozer\'s XI,"" Mangongo said pointedly. Eight weeks before the World Cup, Mangongo was sacked and redeployed with the Under-19s but Taylor\'s mind was made up.', 'He was the second Zimbabwe player to go Kolpak after their Test comeback with Kyle Jarvis also signing for Lancashire. ', ""Taylor was appointed captain after the 2011 World Cup, as Zimbabwe worked towards a return from a self-imposed exile from Test cricket. He led them to a successful Test comeback later that year, in which he also scored his maiden century, and to a win over Pakistan a month later. Under Taylor, Zimbabwe seemed a renewed force, despite a sparse fixture list and struggles away from home.

Taylor marshalled a tense run-chase with the sort of sang froid that few had ever credited him with.', 'As a young cricketer, he was nurtured by Iain Campbell, father of Alistair, at the well-known Lilfordia primary school near Harare, was a regular choice for national age-group teams and played in two Under-19 World Cups. He made his first-class debut for Mashonaland A at the age of 15; the following year he scored 200 not out in the B Division of the Logan Cup, and he was fast-tracked into the Zimbabwe national team against Sri Lanka in 2003-04 at the age of 18 after the withdrawal of the so-called rebel players. As a batsman he was soon well respected by the opposition, but tended to get out when well set. Poor footwork early in an innings was also a handicap at the start of his career, but he worked to improve that and in November 2009 struck his maiden one-day hundred.', ""That knock proved something of a turning point for him, and in the year that followed he struck centuries against Sri Lanka and South Africa and proved to be Zimbabwe's stand-out batsman at the 2011 World Cup, his trademark uppercut to third man one of the lasting images of the tournament. His star continued to rise as Zimbabwe readied themselves for a return to Test cricket, and in June 2011 he was named captain of the national side."", 'The additional responsibility of captaincy, which he had always fancied, worked wonders for his batting, as he scored four centuries in his first seven Tests in charge, after scoring none in his ten previous Tests. He also scored hundreds in each innings against Bangladesh in Harare in 2013, thus becoming the first from Zimbabwe, and the 12th in all, to achieve this feat. ', ""In July 2014, as part of ZC's split captaincy plan, he retained the Test leadership while Elton Chigumbura took over the limited-overs games. Though he's not very swift in the field, he has a safe pair of hands and kept wicket for Zimbabwe fairly often before Richmond Mutumbami and Regis Chakabva's progress as wicketkeepers allowed him to concentrate more fully on his batting."", ""Taylor's move to Nottinghamshire did not go altogether smoothly. His Championship displays were highly inconsistent. He also caused consternation by falling asleep in an unlocked car after his celebrations of Nottinghamshire's progress to the semi-finals of the Royal London Cup in 2015 went haywire. Taylor had to be woken by police after a Nottingham businessman opened his unlocked Chevrolet Matiz to find Taylor sleeping off a long night close to the Trent Bridge ground. He escaped charges. At least before he departed he managed to pick up a winners' medal in the 2017 Royal London Cup final."", '\n', '\n']",[],28.0,56,4,1840.0,171,35.38,3564,51.62,6,8,186,15,27.0,0.0,188.0,187,15,6156.0,145*,35.79,8085,76.14,10,36,537,96,118.0,29.0,30.0,30,5,660.0,75*,26.40,565,116.81,0,5,58,18,14.0,2.0,128.0,232,13,8807,217,40.21,,,31,31,,,142.0,4.0,298.0,290,26,9327,154,35.32,,,18,51,,,185.0,41.0,144.0,138,19,3202,101*,26.90,2638,121.37,1,23,292,85,57.0,13.0,28.0,4,42,38,0.0,-,-,35.33,5.42,-,0,0,0,188.0,21,396,406,9.0,3/54,3/54,45.11,6.15,44.0,0,0,0,30.0,2,30,17,1.0,1/16,1/16,17.00,3.4,30.0,0,0,0,128.0,,384,225,4,2/36,,56.25,3.51,96.0,0,0,0,298.0,,606,604,20,5/28,5/28,30.20,5.98,30.3,0,1,0,144.0,8,150,152,8,3/38,3/38,19.00,6.08,18.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Earmarked as the long-term successor to club colleague Andy Flower, Taibu was plucked from Churchill Boys High School to tour the West Indies in 1999-00, after impressing onlookers with his natural ability. Three months later he was in England, on stand-by at Trent Bridge after injury put Flower's dual role in doubt. He had yet to play domestic first-class cricket at this stage - his debut for Mashonaland had to be put on hold after he turned up at the wrong ground - but he has toured South Africa with the Zimbabwe U-19s, and was one of Zimbabwe's few bright spots in the 2003 World Cup and their tour to England later that year. A promising batsman, albeit with a penchant for cross-batted strokes, he is steadily improving at Test and ODI level. \n"", ""In April 2004, he was appointed captain of Zimbabwe following the resignation of Heath Streak, and he led a woefully inexperienced by example in the face of repeated heavy defeats.  But the pressure began to tell, and by the autumn of 2005 he found himself at the front of another players revolt, this time widely backed and against the general  mismanagement of the board.  It led to him being villified in the domestic press and threatened by some unsavoury elements connected to the board itself, and in November 2005 he announced his resignation as captain and his retirement from international cricket. Of all the high-profile departures from the game in  Zimbabwe, none were felt so deeply as Taibu - a home-grown product,  a world-class wicketkeeper-batsman, and the country's first black captain.

Two-and-a-half erratic years later, in October 2006, he was arrested after setting fire to the offices of the Harare Sports Club and the National Academy, but was cleared at his subsequent trial in January 2008, on the grounds that he had been suffering psychiatric problems, including partial complex epilepsy, ever since the injury. That seemed to signal the end of his career, but he refused to accept that and his perseverance was rewarded in 2009 when the Zimbabwe board agreed to offer him another chance. \n"", 'During his career he was attacking and naturally athletic, and was first drafted into the Zimbabwe team for the second Test against Pakistan in November 2002, at the expense of Guy Whittall. At his most comfortable against pace bowling, Vermeulen was a back-foot player by inclination, particularly strong on the cut, pull and hook shots, although he was also a sweet timer of the ball through the covers. A former captain of Zimbabwe\'s Under-19 team, Vermeulen had a desire to succeed that - even before his injury - could spill over into petulance and worse. In 1996 he was banned from representing his school, Prince Edward High in Harare, for walking off with the stumps after receiving a poor lbw decision and locking himself in the changing room. That was a sign of things to come. He was sent home during the second Test of the 2003 England tour when, after becoming only the 13th man in Test history to record a pair on the same day of a match, ignored a management instruction to travel with the rest of the squad on the coach, instead choosing to leave the ground on his own. He had earlier refused to stop a ball at Hove because ""it was too cold"" and had also had run-ins with the team manager. ', 'On the pitch he made a few decent scores in one-day internationals and played three matches in the 2003 World Cup. He was an excellent slip fielder, an occasional offbreak bowler, and a former national junior javelin champion. ', 'Despite his troubles Vermeulen had an excellent 2004-05 season in which he averaged 43.60 in domestic cricket but the rise in his numbers coincided with economic decline and political turmoil and he did not immediately have the opportunity to see if that could translate on the cricket field. ', ""In 2009, Vermeulen made a brief comeback for ODIs against South Africa but then disappeared off the radar again while he made his way around Zimbabwe's domestic circuit. He spent time at the Tuskers, Mid-West Rhinos, Mountaineers and Southern Rocks and completed a full house of playing for all the teams in the country when he returned to the Eagles in his home-town of Harare. "", 'Although he had a side career in golf, Vermeulen decided to make the 2013-14 season his final go at trying to be an international cricketer. The domestic season was stalled by a player strike but once it got underway, Vermeulen made good on his commitment. He was the second-highest run scorer in the Logan Cup with 580 runs in seven matches at an average of 64.44.

That shot has occupied a proud position in the repertoire of some of Zimbabwe's finest batsmen: legend has it that Dave Houghton brought up both his hundred and his double with reverse-sweeps in the course of his 266 against Sri Lanka, and Andy Flower used the stroke in an almost profligate manner in many of his memorable innings. Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering. \n"", ""Reverse-sweeps aside, Williams has other shots too, and plays them often. His precocious talent was apparent while he was still a teenager. He was expected to be called up at the time of the players' strike in April 2004, but his father Collin, a former first-class player and national hockey coach, refused to release him and insisted his son should concentrate more on his studies. Almost a year later, and with just one first-class match under his belt, he was drafted into the Zimbabwe squad to tour South Africa. Although he led the U-19 side in the World Cup in Sri Lanka in February 2006 - the highlight being a win over England - there were rumours both before and after the tournament that he was not happy with the board. This turned out to be true when he turned down a central contract the following month, opting to look for a more settled career overseas. He changed his mind three months later, however, returning to play for Zimbabwe. The on-off farrago resurfaced in 2008 when he again quit for a contract in South Africa, only to return weeks later. "", ""One feels that disciplinary issues, whether perceived or actual, are never far away with Williams, who often speaks in as forthright a manner as he bats. He is one of Zimbabwe's best players of spin but was was not considered for selection for Zimbabwe's tour of Bangladesh in late 2014 after interruptions in his involvement in a training camp and an aborted disciplinary hearing.

A regular in the Zimbabwe one-day side from the mid 1980s - he appeared in the 1987, 1992 and 1996 World Cups - his Test debut didn't come until he was 37.  This was largely because of his reputation as something of a slogger, a tag he disproved with a patient 50 in his first Test against England in 1996-97. He retained his place for the second Test, which turned out to be his last first-class appearance. He played another seven ODIs before retiring at the end of the season. \n"", ""The Wallers lost their farm during the Zimbabwean government's controversial land reform programme and Waller moved in to coaching full-time, taking up a position with Namibia. After a couple of years, he moved back to Zimbabwe, via another temporary coaching spell in Johannesburg.

In September of that year, he became Mid West Rhinos' head coach, but spent the Zimbabwean winter in the United Kingdom and a position with the Eastbourne College First XI. When Alan Butcher's tenure as coach of the Zimbabwe national side came to an end, Waller's was one of several names thrown into the hat to succeed him. In May 2013, Waller was named national coach but he was on a tour of Sri Lanka with the Eastbourne College team at the time. Steve Mangongo performed the head-coaching duties for Zimbabwe's home series against Bangladesh, and after Waller had wrapped up his duties in the UK his first coaching assignment with Zimbabwe was the five-match series against India in July 2013.

But his bulk - he conservatively tops the scales at 20 stones (280lbs) - often overshadows his accuracy and penetration.  On Bermuda's Intercontinental Cup debut in USA he took 7 for 57 in a losing cause. A year later he grabbed 11 for 72 in the same competition against the Cayman Islands.  He was just much an asset in the one-day game, although that had to be offset against his fielding which was, when Bermuda did  not need a slip, a real liability. His batting was not much better, and while he could  thump the ball, he was almost always restricted to singles, regardless of where the ball was hit.

Though also a talented footballer, she chose cricket because she figured she ""could travel the world more by playing cricket than football."" West Indies Women have been the major beneficiary of that decision ever since she emerged onto the international scene as a 17-year old, hitting a 49-ball 90 on T20I debut against Ireland in 2008. In 2013 she became the only player in history, male or female, to ever achieve the number one ODI ranking in both batting and bowling simultaneously. \n', ""Taylor, who has opened for West Indies Women since she was a teenager, is known for her determined accumulation of runs.

There was never any doubt about the fast bowler's talent. Taylor is a natural in getting the ball to move away and, when at his best, he drew comparisons with West Indies legend Michael Holding. Injuries, however, had a knack of dragging him down. \n"", ""In a five-year stretch between November 2009 and June 2014, Taylor was able to play only five T20Is and four ODIs, and had his commitment questioned by the WICB. Just before that tough period, he had spearheaded one of West Indies' greatest Test wins, at his home ground in Kingston, by ripping through England with a match haul of 8 for 85. He eventually regained his place in the team for a tour of India in 2014 - which the players abandoned due to a payment dispute with their cricket board - and has been a regular fixture in Tests and ODIs since then."", ""Taylor's rise to international cricket was rapid. He was named the most promising fast bowler in the 2003 Carib Beer Series, after picking up 21 wickets at 20.14 in six first-class matches. That haul included a second-innings 8 for 59 in Jamaica's five-wicket victory over Trinidad & Tobago, a match in which he took ten wickets for the first time. But a back injury sidelined him from competitive cricket."", ""He picked up 26 wickets at 16.61 in the Carib Beer Cup in the 2004-05 season, and in the next, he grabbed 12 wickets at 29 to force his way back into the West Indies team. When India toured the West Indies in mid-2006, they ran into an energised Taylor at his best. Quick and accurate, Taylor turned into West Indies' spearhead as the series progressed. His pacy burst on the lifeless surface in St Kitts won many admirers, but it was his lethal performance in Kingston that underlined his worth. Getting the ball to lift off a good length, he thrilled his home crowd with his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests."", ""He picked up 26 wickets at 27.69 in the 2006-07 season and bagged his then career-best figures in ODIs - 4 for 49, including a hat-trick, when he bowled West Indies to a thrilling win against Australia in the Champions Trophy. He bettered that a year later when he snared 5 for 48 against Zimbabwe, and in 2008 was West Indies' leading bowler in the Test series against Sri Lanka, with 11 wickets in two matches at 24.81. That helped him bag the Jamaica Cricketer-of-the-Year award for 2008. That year he also blitzed a Test century at just under a run a ball, from No. 8, against New Zealand. "", ""Form on his comeback after back injury in 2014 fuelled his 2015 World Cup dream, where he was West Indies' highest wicket-taker with 17 scalps in seven matches. He was also part of West Indies' World T20 winning squad in 2016.

He began at Canterbury as a no-account batsman and the most parsimonious of medium-paced bowlers, but his batting developed quickly. After becoming a free-scoring one-day player Astle was turned by the national coach Glenn Turner into a first-rate Test top-order batsman, with consecutive hundreds in West Indies in 1995-96. He ripped up the record books with his 222 against England, at Christchurch in 2001-02, which was the fastest double century in Tests, coming up off only 153 balls. A knee injury forced him out of action towards the end of 2003, but he was picked for the tour of England in 2004. Astle is now an assured batsman in both games, an expert slip-catcher, and an occasional medium-pace partnership-breaker. He may be a certain selection, but his laid-back attitude means he has never been considered for the captaincy, despite his seniority. His 10th Test match century was made against Sri Lanka in April 2005, followed soon after by his 11th.  And in September, he became only the tenth man to score 15 ODI centuries, arguably becoming New Zealand's greatest one-day player. In 2006 he signed for Lancashire, although he wasn't at his ballistic best.  He surprised most people by retiring from international cricket six weeks before the Word Cup, citing a lack of motivation. Six months later, he retired from first-class cricket as well.\n"", ' ', ' July 2007 \n']",['Club: East Christchurch-Shirley'],81.0,137,10,4702.0,222,37.02,9479,49.60,11,24,612,39,70.0,0.0,223.0,217,14,7090.0,145*,34.92,9760,72.64,16,41,720,86,83.0,0.0,4.0,4,1,74.0,40*,24.66,67,110.44,0,0,7,2,3.0,0.0,171.0,272,24,9321,223,37.58,,,19,50,,,134.0,0.0,377.0,358,31,11635,145*,35.58,,,26,64,,,146.0,0.0,22.0,22,2,545,75*,27.25,472,115.46,0,4,58,13,7.0,0.0,81.0,94,5688,2143,51.0,3/27,6/62,42.01,2.26,111.5,0,0,0,223.0,159,4850,3809,99.0,4/43,4/43,38.47,4.71,48.9,1,0,0,4.0,2,41,50,4.0,3/20,3/20,12.50,7.31,10.2,0,0,0,171.0,,13441,4897,150,6/22,,32.64,2.18,89.6,,2,0,377.0,,10884,7396,244,4/14,4/14,30.31,4.07,44.6,6,0,0,22.0,13,269,308,15,3/20,3/20,20.53,6.86,17.9,0,0,0,False,True,False,True

Cricket, though, was his calling. He lived in a neighborhood which included eventual New Zealand team-mates Kane Williamson and Doug Bracewell, and had the backing of a supportive household that also kept him grounded.', '\nSigns of his skill were evident even as a teenager. As a 17-year old, he was named the fastest secondary school bowler in the country. A year later, he was representing New Zealand at the Under-19 World Cup.', ""\nThe transition to senior cricket, though, was not quite seamless. Boult suffered a stress fracture of the back in 2009 which put him out of cricket for two years and taught him to concentrate on strength and conditioning. There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark. He became one of New Zealand's irreplaceable players across formats and one of many protagonists in the side's march to their first World Cup final in 2015. "", ""\nBoult had a tough time breaking into the limited-overs sides at first, due to a perception that he doesn't move the white ball as much as the red one. But his effectiveness in Test cricket was too compelling to ignore: he raced past 100 wickets in his 29th match and in 2013, only two years since his debut, he was New Zealand's top-wicket taker. With Brendon McCullum placing a high premium on attacking cricket in the shorter versions as well and Boult proving himself as a bowler who preferred getting batsmen out rather than keeping them quiet, it was a perfect fit. Confirmation came in World Cup 2015 when he ended up the joint-leading wicket taker with 22 scalps in nine matches including 5 for 27 in an epic victory over Australia. His worth in T20 cricket was emphasised by a (approximately) $600,000 payday in the IPL."", '\nBoult\'s strength, according to Northern Districts coach John Pamment, is that, ""he\'s got a lovely wrist position and the fact that the wrist goes right behind the ball gives him that control."" Another asset for Boult is friend and sounding board Tim Southee. When on song, their partnership makes for compelling viewing, not to mention telling numbers. In 2014, the pair picked up nearly half the wickets New Zealand took - 67 of 143 - en route to the side\'s most successful Test year, with five wins in nine matches. Boult is also among the few fast bowlers who are exceptional fielders, and has a particular knack for one-handed blinders.', '\n']",['New Zealand Cricket Almanack Player of the Year - 2015'],61.0,76,37,562.0,52*,14.41,1063,52.86,0,1,56,25,36.0,0.0,79.0,35,20,144.0,21*,9.6,190,75.78,0,0,13,6,23.0,0.0,25.0,7,3,14.0,5,3.50,24,58.33,0,0,0,0,12.0,0.0,94.0,116,47,970,61,14.05,1912,50.73,0,2,105,39,51.0,0.0,108.0,49,25,199,21*,8.29,269,73.97,0,0,17,6,33.0,0.0,88.0,19,11,36,5*,4.50,59,61.01,0,0,0,0,39.0,0.0,61.0,115,13591,6776,246.0,6/30,10/80,27.54,2.99,55.2,13,8,1,79.0,79,4290,3632,147.0,7/34,7/34,24.7,5.07,29.1,5,5,0,25.0,25,551,784,37.0,4/34,4/34,21.18,8.53,14.8,1,0,0,94.0,169,19213,9437,354,6/30,10/80,26.65,2.94,54.2,15,16,1,108.0,106,5729,4861,189,7/34,7/34,25.71,5.09,30.3,7,5,0,88.0,88,1895,2651,98,4/34,4/34,27.05,8.39,19.3,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

Bond always lifted against Australia, and it was a sign of his great skill that he took 44 ODI wickets at 15.79 against them.

"", ""Bates scored an unbeaten 94 off 61 balls against Pakistan in the 2014 World Twenty20 - the highest score by a New Zealander in women's T20Is. In the same year, she was selected to captain the Rest of the World, against MCC Women at Lord's. "", ""At 5-foot-8, with an athletic body honed on the basketball field, the attacking style comes more naturally to Bates than most. She spent 2015 consolidating her status as one of the power hitters of the women's game, averaging 129 in New Zealand's ODI series against Sri Lanka in November, which they swept 5-0. Her good form continued in the three-match T20 series - which also ended in a whitewash for Sri Lanka - where she averaged 52.50. Bates ended 2015 fourth on the list of all-time run-scorers in women's T20Is and was subsequently named Wisden's Leading Women's Cricketer in the World."", ""Bates is among the first women from New Zealand able to consider herself a full-time cricketer, having been awarded one of the inaugural female contracts by New Zealand Cricket in April 2013.

A batsman of elegance, poise and range, Crowe broke through into Test cricket as a 19-year-old, and in a short span of time was heralded as the best young batsman in the world. By the end of his Test career, he was New Zealand\'s highest run-getter and century-maker, scorer or 10,000 international runs, its captain in the 1992 World Cup who engineered an exhilarating home run all the way to the semi-finals, and a totemic figure in his team\'s feisty Test performances through the Eighties.\n \nThe son of a cricketing family, whose father had played first-class cricket, Crowe came from suburban Auckland, destined for greatness. He arrived a complete batsman still in his teens, a technique burnished in both attack and defence, a fierce competitor alongside a devoted student of cricket with an innate game sense. In his prime, Crowe left the viewer with the impression of having a nanosecond more time to play his strokes, with balance in their execution and equanimity in his stance. He was a batsman of clean lines off the front foot, tall, elegant and classically sound, his signature strokes being down the ground, but capable of shots all around the wicket. His debut season in English county cricket as a 21-year-old replacement for Viv Richards at Somerset was a clear illustration that he belonged. At the crease, Peter Roebuck wrote of him, Crowe could ""soar like an eagle."" \n', ""Along with a clutch of senior players, with Richard Hadlee leading the bowling, Crowe was one of the central pillars of New Zealand's most successful team in history at the time. His 77 Tests and 143 ODIs for New Zealand remain memorable for his prolific batting through the 80s against the world's best bowling line-ups, both home and away, against high pace and quality spin. As captain of New Zealand at the 1992 World Cup, Crowe maximized New Zealand's resources in home conditions, turning the conventional rules of 50-over cricket on their head. He promoted big-hitting Mark Greatbatch up the order to open the batting, and started the bowling with offspinner Dipak Patel.\n \nInjuries ranging from a broken shin, back trouble, torn hamstrings and in latter years, serious knee injuries, plagued him and would end his career. Through this, he produced performances of determination and dominance, part of 16 historic Test victories in which he averaged 55.5, ten runs above his career average. His highest Test score of 299 against Sri Lanka remained New Zealand's highest individual innings for more than two decades before Brendon McCullum's 302 versus India, in 2014. \n \nAfter retirement, he worked in the media, heading Sky's television coverage of cricket in New Zealand for a period of time, invented a new format for the sport called Cricket Max, and worked with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the early years of the IPL. A thoughtful writer and commentator on the game, Crowe remained a mentor and a guide for a younger generation of New Zealand cricketers. Crowe was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2012 and although he was in remission for a time, he suffered a relapse in 2014, and died in 2016 at the age of 53.""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1985'],77.0,131,11,5444.0,299,45.36,12190,44.65,17,18,659,27,71.0,0.0,143.0,140,18,4704.0,107*,38.55,6476,72.63,4,34,378,29,66.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,247.0,412,62,19608,299,56.02,,,71,80,,,226.0,0.0,261.0,256,27,8740,155*,38.16,,,11,59,,,115.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,77.0,35,1377,676,14.0,2/25,3/107,48.28,2.94,98.3,0,0,0,143.0,46,1296,954,29.0,2/9,2/9,32.89,4.41,44.6,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,247.0,,7921,4010,119,5/18,,33.69,3.03,66.5,,4,0,261.0,,3994,2859,99,4/24,4/24,28.87,4.29,40.3,2,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He had appeared in Tests against all the other countries before taking over from Geoff Howarth in Pakistan in 1984-85. Very determined, he tended to produce his best when the chips were down. A good musician and a qualified teacher, he became a regular selection after a successful home series against Pakistan in 1978-79, and was an important member of the team that reached the semi-finals of the 1979 World Cup. Consistent batting, including a record seventh-wicket stand with Geoff Howarth, helped New Zealand to a shock series victory over West Indies in 1979-80, but it was not until the first Test against England in 1983-84 that he finally registered a maiden Test century, a painstaking eight-hour match-saving marathon of 174 not out. He further enhanced his reputation by leading New Zealand to a first series win in England, in 1986, endearing himself to spectators by his sunny disposition. When Bruce French was felled by a Hadlee bouncer at Lord's, it was Coney who permitted England to play two substitute wicketkeepers. He was awarded an MBE in 1986, and became a successful TV and radio sports commentator and presenter.

Nine Test centuries is a poor return for such a talent, but Fleming was worth more than his statistics. \n"", ""A stint with Middlesex in 2001 laid the foundations for a successful re-evaluation of his batting methods where the inability to convert half-centuries to centuries did no justice to his quality. But after a breakout innings of 134 not out to steer New Zealand to a classy World Cup victory over South Africa, along with another spell in county cricket, with Yorkshire, Fleming confirmed his greater batting consistency with a career-highest 274 not out against Sri Lanka in the first Test of their 2003 series.

He spent the off-season playing at Nottinghamshire and dodging questions about whether he would join the Indian Cricket League. In September he announced he would stay on as a New Zealand Test player but retired from ODIs, and at the same time was relieved of the Test captaincy after a decade in charge, in favour of Daniel Vettori.

As a keeper he was a good, if inconsistent, player and he was better standing up. Much of his inconsistency as a keeper could be put\ndown to that. As a batsman he loved to pepper the boundary square on the\noff side off the back foot, and his batting form as captain in India was\nample proof of his ability to lead by example. At ODI level, with the side in\ndesperate need of a No. 3, Germon was occasionally pressed into service in this\nrole. Against Australia in the 1996 World Cup quarter-final he was outstandingly\nsuccessful at No. 3, sharing in a huge partnership with Chris Harris. In 1997 his form fell away under new coach Steve Rixon and he started to lose some of the players' respect.

A neat right-hander with some delightful off-side strokes, he was especially severe on the half-volley, which he would drive unerringly. The younger brother of Hedley Howarth, Geoff was also a fine fielder and a useful offspinner. In 1969 he started a long and frustrating apprenticeship at Surrey, and it was not until 1972-73 that he represented a New Zealand provincial side. Useful performances in the Prudential World Cup of 1975 hinted at his quality, but it was not until 1977-78, possibly his last chance, that he revealed his true ability. He scored 122 and 102 against England at Auckland, saving New Zealand on a worsening wicket. Confident, and sure of his place at last, he kept New Zealand afloat in a seething tide of English seamers in 1978, and in 1980 he captained New Zealand to an outstanding series win over  West Indies. Further triumphs followed, including the first win on English soil in 52 years, and Howarth's astute captaincy and personable nature had a lot to do with it. His career ended in a sad anticlimax in 1985. By then wearing glasses, he was supposedly Surrey's captain, but was not chosen for any Championship matches. Nor was he reinstated as captain of New Zealand. He was awarded the MBE in 1981, and the OBE in 1984, and for a time in the early 1990s was coach and manager of the national team.

Harris's ability to score all round the wicket, pick the gaps and hit boundaries at just the right time turned him into New Zealand's answer to Michael Bevan, and his 62 not-outs in one-day cricket testify to his ability to close out an innings. His bowling was ideally suited to the shorter game - a gentle medium-pace that forces the batsman to do all the work allied to subtle changes in pace and the ability to cut the ball either way off the wicket. Harris was also a very safe fielder, particularly within the inner circle and in the covers. He hit a purple patch with the bat in late 1997, going 19 consecutive innings (eight of them in ODIs)  without being dismissed and registering three half-centuries. He also played a vital role in New Zealand's triumph at the ICC KnockOut tournament, putting together a partnership of 122 for the sixth wicket with Chris Cairns to set up a last-over win against India in the final. But, again like Bevan, Harris was unable to carry his undeniable talent into Test cricket and his 23 appearances between 1992 and 2002 resulted in a disappointing batting average of 20.44 and an untenable bowling average of 73.12. In 2004, Harris became the first New Zealand player to have played 250 ODIs, although a shoulder injury marred his 250th, and final, appearance. He also remains New Zealand's second-highest wicket-taker in one-dayers, behind Daniel Vettori. At the age of 40 Harris remains an effective player for Canterbury in domestic cricket, although retirement cannot be far away.

","['\nFew players in the history of cricket have carried the fortunes of their team to quite the same extent as Richard Hadlee. By the time he retired from international cricket in 1990, at the age of 39 and with a knighthood newly conferred upon him for his services to the game, Hadlee had cemented his place as one of the great fast bowlers of all time, and lifted New Zealand to unprecedented feats in the Test arena.  \n', 'As the first player to reach 400 Test wickets, Hadlee was always assured of immortality, but in addition to his matchless skills with the ball, he was also a hard-hitting batsman of unquestioned skill, and he is acknowledged as one of the four great allrounders of the 1980s, along with Ian Botham, Imran Khan and Kapil Dev. ', 'One of five sons of Walter Hadlee, the former New Zealand captain, his cricket education began at an early age, and in 1971-72 he debuted for Canterbury, forming a penetrative new-ball partnership with his elder brother Dayle. In those days, however, Hadlee was a tearaway, placing speed far ahead of guile, an attitude that was matched by his unkempt, long-haired appearance. As his knowhow grew, however, so his run-up (and locks) shortened, and all the attributes of the model fast bowler fell into place. His lithe, whippy, side-on action made life uncomfortable for all the great batsmen of his era, as he extracted pace, bounce and movement from even the least responsive of surfaces. ', 'His first great demolition job came in Wellington in February 1978 - five years on from his debut - when his 10 wickets, including 6 for 26 in the second innings, condemned England to a first defeat against the Kiwis. However, it was for the Australians that he preserved his finest efforts, and his 15-wicket haul in Brisbane in 1985-86 remains one of the most talked-of moments in Trans-Tasman rivalry.

He played two matches in the tournament and impressed with his pace and was quickly touted as New Zealand's fastest bowler since Shane Bond.

The start was expensive and injuries disrupted his first-class career, before he returned to the headlines when picked in New Zealand's squad for the 2012 World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. Knowing what a precious resource they had with his pace - he showed he could push the speed gun over 150kph - and continued problems with injuries, a very cautious approach was taken with Milne which limited his first-class exposure.

While he was recovering, Shane Bond, Ian Butler and Jacob Oram seized their opportunities, making it harder for Mills to force his way back. In and out of the team after the 2003 World Cup in which he made only one fleeting, wicketless appearance - he marked another comeback, against Pakistan in 2003-04, by picking up a reprimand for excessive appealing. However, he did enough to earn a call-up for the tour of England in 2004, and made his Test debut in the third match at Trent Bridge. But he picked up a side strain during the game, and was forced to fly home and miss the NatWest Series. That was a shame, as one-day cricket is really his forte: he played throughout the 2005-06 season, chipping in with wickets in almost every game, even if his once-promising batting had diminished to the point that he managed double figures only once in 16 matches."", ""A feisty temper remained, though: Stephen Fleming had to pull him away from Graeme Smith during a bad-tempered one-day series towards the end of 2005. Mills returned to South Africa for the Tests early in 2006, and picked up eight wickets in the two matches he played, almost doubling his career tally. He played in the 2006 Champions Trophy, but his injury jinx struck again and he was ruled out of the 2007 World Cup with a serious knee problem. He returned to fashion a crushing 189-run Test victory over England in Hamilton in March 2008, but was later ruled out of the remainder of the series as his knee played up once again. He recovered in time to join Kings XI Punjab at the inaugural IPL, in early 2009, and led New Zealand's attack against Australia in the Chappell-Hadlee Series, in which he picked up nine wickets at 20.33, subsequently making his way to the No. 1 spot on the ICC ODI bowlers' rankings."", 'In November 2009, once again he was forced out of cricket, requiring shoulder and knee surgery.

A stylish middle-order batsman, he played 13 Tests and 66 ODIs for New Zealand and made three centuries. But turned his back on international cricket in 2007-08 to play county cricket for Gloucestershire and spent 11 seasons in the West Country before returning home to play for Wellington, at 37, the city in which his career had begun. He enjoyed a steady county career without lighting up the English game that his early promise suggested was possible. \n', 'The 146 he made against Australia in March 2005 proved the high point in his career, not the beginning of greatness some foresaw. He was unshakable against the pace of the mighty Australians at their peak. Another big hundred followed against Sri Lanka and a year later he was signed by Gloucestershire as their overseas player. The cosy life in county cricket proved too attractive and Marshall rejected a central contract for 2007-08, eventually becoming a home-qualified player for Gloucestershire via an Irish passport.', 'It was a disappointment for New Zealand, who first picked Marshall in December 2000 for a Test debut against South Africa. Batting at No. 7 he made an unbeaten 40, showing great maturity and promise. But he was not picked again and had to wait for another three years to get his chance when he was called up for the one-day series in Pakistan in 2003-04. In his third game, he scored an impressive 101 not out in Faisalabad, and later scored 64 and 84 to help New Zealand win the corresponding home series. He then helped New Zealand to win the 2003-04 home one-day series against South Africa, and was called up for the 2004 NatWest Series in England, scoring 75 not out and 55 in the group matches before a solid 44 saw New Zealand win the final against West Indies. ', ""Marshall struggled to hold down a place in New Zealand's ODI side through 2006-07 and although he was not picked in the World Cup squad, he later joined the team as a replacement when Lou Vincent broke his wrist. Marshall played three games in the Caribbean but then sprung a surprise by refusing a national contract."", 'His career with Gloucestershire began as an overseas player in 2006 where he scored 102 against Worcestershire on début and finished the season with 1218 runs at 60.90. That year he also made his highest score for the county, 168 against Leicestershire at Cheltenham. But since making the move permanent he has failed to match that mark and suffered a torrid 2011 season, making only 401 runs in 19 innings. He bounced back to an extent with his first century for three years in 2012 and managed to average 37.36 in a horrendously wet season. He, like many, found the going far easier in 2013 and made over 1000 runs in a season for just the second time in his career, including four centuries, but slipped back in the following season. ', 'The arrival of Richard Dawson as coach was good for him, evidenced by his four Championship hundreds in his farewell Championship summer in 2016. He ended 11 seasons emotionally with a pugnacious 70-odd at Bristol, boosting his career tally to 14,286 runs including 30 centuries.', ""His undoubted highlight in limited-overs cricket was winning the Royal London Cup final against Surrey in 2015, Gloucestershire's first trophy in over a decade. In 2011, along with Kevin O'Brien, he played in the first T20 innings where two players scored centuries; Gloucestershire's 254 for 3 against Middlesex at Uxbridge broke the domestic T20 world record."", 'Marshall also played in the rebel Indian Cricket League in 2008 for the Royal Bengal Tigers.

But he regained his limited-overs place for the home series against Sri Lanka in December 2006 and strong performances at the CB Series in Australia, followed by a New Zealand record 67-ball ODI century in the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, ensured his ticket to the World Cup. McMillan impressed with bat and ball in his comeback, which was timely as New Zealand searched for all-round options with injuries to the likes of Scott Styris and Jacob Oram. McMillan, a player who had been gifted international selection from the age of 21, began his career productively and in March 2001 he took a world record 26 runs off one Younis Khan over in a Test against Pakistan at Hamilton. His destructive batting perhaps promised more than he delivered, however, and he was forced to test his resolve when overlooked for a tour of Sri Lanka in 2003. McMillan returned with 83 not out and an unbeaten century in India in 2003-04 to cement his Test spot but 18 months later lost it again and was views as purely a limited-overs option. His World Cup was useful without being outstanding but he was New Zealand's leading run-scorer at the ICC World Twenty20. It was to be his final international tournament, as he announced his retirement at the age of 31 in October 2007. He joined the ICL soon after, captained the Royal Bengal Tigers, quit the league in 2009 and signed a one-year contract with Canterbury.

They won again in 2003-04 and were runners up in 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2005-06.', 'While Patel probably never fulfilled his ability on the international stage, he developed into a highly effective bowling all-rounder at domestic level and has enjoyed a particularly successful spell as a long-term overseas player for Warwickshire, for whom he has produced much of his best cricket. At the end of the 2014 English domestic season - a season in which he had rejected an approach from New Zealand to resurrect his international career - he was named the Most Valuable Player in county cricket.', 'It was a return of 6 for 32 against Otago in the last State Championship match of 2004-05 that propelled him into international cricket. Bracewell took him to Zimbabwe for a one-day tournament in August 2005. He played nine ODIs during the season, but in eight was either the super-sub or the subbed-out player; his batting - at that stage - offered little. At home his 2 for 23 from ten overs throttled Sri Lanka at Wellington, and won him the man-of-the-match award, then three wickets at Christchurch helped subdue West Indies. All this put Patel in line for a first Test cap, which came against South Africa at Cape Town in April 2006. ', ""He performed more than respectably - a five-wicket haul against West Indies at Napier in late 2008 was a highlight - but, with Daniel Vettori's presence limiting opportunities, Patel was generally reduced to the role of substitute or second spinner. He played only six home Tests - in each of them he was second spinner to Vettori - and when he finally had a chance to stake a claim as first choice, he struggled against India, Sri Lanka and South Africa. When New Zealand were thrashed by South Africa - they were bowled out for just 45 in Cape Town - with Patel bowled backing away, it seemed his time was up."", ""But whatever his struggles in international cricket, he proved an inspired choice as overseas player for Warwickshire. After scoring a maiden century on first-class debut for the club in 2009, he returned for every season afterwards except 2010, claiming 185 first-class wickets for the side up to the end of 2014 at an average of just 27.12 and contributing nearly 1,500 runs, too, at an average of nearly 29. He played a huge role in Warwickshire's Championship success of 2012, their T20 success of 2014 and took them within sight of a double of that season with an outstanding spell of bowling against Durham in the final of the Royal London One-Day Cup at Lord's. He finished with 107 wickets in all competitions that year and turned down a recall to the New Zealand squad for the Caribbean tour to ensure he maintained his excellent relationship with Warwickshire. They responded by extending his contract until the end of 2016."", 'Patel duly paid them back with 69 wickets to top the bowling charts for the season. He subsequently made a comeback to the national side when he was picked for the tour of India in September of that year and filled in for the injured Mark Craig for the second Test at Eden Gardens in his first appearance for his country in over three years.', ""In March the following year, Patel played his first Test at the Basin Reserve, his home ground, against South Africa. Two months later, he played his final match for New Zealand, an ODI against Bangladesh in Dublin. Though he made it to New Zealand's squad for the Champions Trophy, he did not play a game.

In the 1992 World Cup, he was used sensationally as an opening bowler, initially against Australia, in an attempt to counteract the tactic of hitting over the in-field during the first 15 overs. This strategy paid off handsomely, and he was often used in the  same  role in other matches henceforth.

His form might have been expected to decline with age, but instead the super-fit Parore (who sometimes jogged home after a hard day in the field) reached the peak of his wicketkeeping powers in 2000-01, at the age of 30. In the mid-1990s Parore was often at odds with the New Zealand establishment, and was given to expressive verbal advice from behind the stumps. But he later fitted comfortably into the senior-pro role, both in encouraging the work of the young New Zealand bowlers, and re-polishing his own ability as perhaps the most consistent keeper in world cricket. His batting could occasionally be top-notch too. When Lee Germon took over as captain and wicketkeeper in the mid-1990s, Parore kept his place as New Zealand\'s regular No. 3, and in 2001-02 at Perth he helped Nathan Astle add 253 for the eighth wicket - of which Parore made 110 - against the best attack in the world. Parore described the feat as ""pretty cool"", but by the end of that season his enthusiasm had gone.

His performances were strong enough to earn him a call-up to the New Zealand ODI side once he had qualified in 2013 and against England in May he debuted, becoming the first man since Kepler Wessels nearly 20 years earlier to represent two full ICC member nations.', '\nAs New Zealand rode an ODI wave that eventually culminated with defeat at the final of the 2015 World Cup, Ronchi made a decent case for himself as a lower-order batsman. He smashed 170 off 99 balls against Sri Lanka in Dunedin in 2014, then the highest score ever by a No. 7 batsman and, in May 2015, seven years after making his international debut, Ronchi earned his maiden Test cap. A half-century in the first innings at Headingley helped his side level a two-match series against England 1-1. Ronchi played three more Tests, two World T20s and two Champions Trophies before calling time on his international career in June 2017. ', ""\nHe had moved with his family to Perth at the age of seven and debuted for Western Australia in 2001-02. He established himself as a solid gloveman and clean striker of the ball and in 2006-07 he made his mark with the then fastest century in Australian domestic one-day history. His 56-ball ton against New South Wales featured a series of powerful pulls off Stuart Clark, and it eclipsed the 62-ball record set by Ronchi's team-mate Adam Voges two seasons earlier. "", '\nAnother standout moment was when he struck 89 from 49 balls against an England XI in the Lilac Hill match the same summer. Perhaps his most remarkable display was in a 2007-08 Pura Cup match against Queensland when he scored a 51-ball century, with the second fifty coming in a scarcely believable 11 deliveries. At that stage Australia were keen to call Ronchi their own, but several years later New Zealand were equally pleased to claim his services.']",[],4.0,8,0,319.0,88,39.87,432,73.84,0,2,41,6,5.0,0.0,85.0,68,9,1397.0,170*,23.67,1220,114.50,1,4,149,43,105.0,12.0,33.0,26,6,359.0,51*,17.95,256,140.23,0,1,30,14,24.0,6.0,100.0,158,15,5614,148,39.25,6685,83.97,16,23,,,343.0,17.0,190.0,171,20,4194,170*,27.77,3919,107.01,7,21,,,249.0,32.0,196.0,180,20,3951,102,24.69,2577,153.31,1,23,391,184,114,34,4.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,85.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,33.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,100.0,,30,12,0,-,-,-,2.40,-,0,0,0,190.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,196.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

He had nearly 10 years of domestic cricket before he was called up to the Test squad, having made his one-day international debut much earlier. Originally a seamer, a knee injury forced him to take his batting more seriously, and he switched from being a bowler who can bat into being a batsman who occasionally bowls. He was awarded his Test cap on the eve of the Karachi Test in May 2002, only for it to be taken back when the match was cancelled as a result of a bomb blast. When he finally got the chance he scored a century and a half-century on debut against West Indies. On the same tour of the Caribbean he broke the New Zealand record for one-day bowling with 6 for 25 in Trinidad.  He has been encouraged by John Bracewell to work on his offspin as an option which would put less strain on his body, but this has yet to be unveiled. Having spent the best part of 11 years with Northern Districts, Styris signed for Auckland - and in 2005 was tempted by Middlesex for a stint in the county game. He continued a strong link with English cricket, taking up a mid-season contract with Durham in 2007. A thrilling 101 in New Zealand's chase of a then-record 322 against Australia at Christchurch was followed by useful contributions in the one-day series against West Indies at home. A timely unbeaten 103 on and some key wickets on the first day at Auckland saw New Zealand take a series lead in the Tests. A back injury ruled him out of the home series against Sri Lanka in December 2006 but he returned in time for the last few games of the tri-series in Australia and was considered fit enough to be named in the 15-man World Cup squad where he was one of the leading performers with 499 runs at 83. After a poor Test series against South Africa in November 2007, he was dropped from the Test side for the home series against Bangladesh. In a bid to prolong his career in the limited-overs formats, he announced his retirement from Tests in February 2008 and played in the one-day side until the 2011 World Cup.\n"", ' May 2011 \n']",[],29.0,48,4,1586.0,170,36.04,3089,51.34,5,6,205,13,23.0,0.0,188.0,161,23,4483.0,141,32.48,5645,79.41,4,28,353,68,73.0,0.0,31.0,29,2,578.0,66,21.40,483,119.66,0,1,40,25,8.0,0.0,128.0,213,20,6048,212*,31.33,,,10,30,,,102.0,0.0,354.0,310,50,8709,141,33.49,,,7,57,,,135.0,0.0,201.0,186,30,4020,106*,25.76,2987,134.58,2,13,264,195,47,0,29.0,36,1960,1015,20.0,3/28,3/44,50.75,3.10,98.0,0,0,0,188.0,161,6114,4839,137.0,6/25,6/25,35.32,4.74,44.6,4,1,0,31.0,21,309,349,18.0,3/5,3/5,19.38,6.77,17.1,0,0,0,128.0,,12826,6446,204,6/32,,31.59,3.01,62.8,,9,1,354.0,,12259,9393,303,6/25,6/25,31.00,4.59,40.4,8,1,0,201.0,161,2964,3637,125,3/5,3/5,29.09,7.36,23.7,0,0,0,False,True,False,True

Unswervingly single-minded in his pursuit of runs, unashamedly ambitious and often impatient of amateur administrators in New Zealand, his career with Worcestershire was the key to his success everywhere else. He deliberately enrolled in the hard school of county cricket, learnt his lessons quickly and never forgot them. Almost frail-looking, pale-faced and serious-minded, Turner was an immaculately straight-playing opener, who defended with a solidity of technique few contemporaries matched. Although limited in his early days, he eventually played every shot on demand, and scored as fast as anyone when necessary. His most characteristic shots were the off-drive and a beautifully-timed drive to midwicket with the face of the bat turned on impact. He began his Test career with a duck, but the broad canvas of the five-day game suited his tempo and temperament, giving a cultured craftsman the opportunity to build his innings steadily, soberly and coolly. He twice carried his bat through a completed Test innings, and in the West Indies in 1971-72 hit four double-centuries in all matches, including successive innings of 259 at Georgetown. Turner captained New Zealand in ten Tests, but relinquished the job after one of his regular disagreements with administrators. He managed New Zealand's teams in Australia and England in 1985-86, and was reappointed in 1995. He coached Otago and was appointed a national selector in August 2007.

A strapping fast-medium bowler in the style of Richard Hadlee's partner of yesteryear Ewen Chatfield, Tuffey impressed as a stronger version and an admirable foil for fast bowler Shane Bond. After a quiet start, he settled into a quality groove as the sort of player capable of performing well on most surfaces. His finest hour to date was 6 for 54 to help New Zealand tie the three-Test series with England in Auckland in 2001-02. A developed into a regular member of both the Test and one-day side, he was picked for New Zealand's 2004 tour of England. However, he then suffered a series of serious injuries including, in 2005, a damaged shoulder which kept him out of the New Zealand side for the best part of two years."", ""Consistent performances in state cricket kept him in the frame, but it was the injury to Kyle Mills which offered him a surprise recall for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy and the 2007 World Cup. His results were distinctly underwhelming, however, and after one World Cup match he slipped quietly home mid-tournament with a recurrence of his previous shoulder injury. He signed up for a stint with the then-unsanctioned, now-defunct Indian Cricket League in October 2007, and was subsequently kept out of international cricket for two years.

Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010. \n"", "" \nWilliamson was born into a sporting family in Tauranga, the largest city in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty region. His father had played Under-17 cricket for Northern Districts, his mother was a representative basketball player, and his sisters played volleyball at age-group level. Williamson took to cricket and it grew beyond a hobby quite quickly."", ' \nHe was modest about his skills, too, - ""Everyone is gifted, I guess, but you get some that seem exceptionally so. I\'m not one of them,"" - yet Williamson was billed to make it since he was 14. He scored a century on Test debut at the age of 20, and at 24 years and 151 days he was the youngest New Zealand batsman to 3000 Test runs- younger than Don Bradman too.', "" \nAt the crease, Williamson is comfortable against pace and spin, and he trusts the coaching manual explicitly despite the mutation of batting in the Twenty20 era. Among his best performances is his maiden Test double-century in January 2015, which helped New Zealand come from behind and beat Sri Lanka in Wellington. The innings was a testament to Williamson's hunger for runs and batting time - he was dissatisfied despite making 242 in over 10 hours."", ' \nWilliamson has made his orthodoxy work and is capable of scoring at a brisk tempo - he has a T20 hundred for Northern Knights and became the quickest New Zealand batsman, and fifth overall, to 3000 ODI runs. For a measure of his consistency, he has two streaks of five or more successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs in 20 months since 2014.', ' \nHe is rarely drawn to emotion and is a genial, but hard, competitor - Williamson once struck the winning six in a roller-coaster, one-wicket win over Australia in the 2015 World Cup, and celebrated with a smile and the calmest of fist pumps as Eden Park exploded in raucous jubilation. ', ' \nWilliamson is also an outstanding catcher and a part-time offspinner, though he needed to remodel his bowling after being banned from bowling in international cricket in June2014 for an illegal action.', 'With the mental strength to match his skills, Williamson was an automatic choice to take over the captaincy at the World T20 in 2016, soon after the retirement of the inspirational Brendon McCullum. Williamson led the team to four back-to-back victories in India, and was highly praised for his tactics that helped the team adapt to slow, turning pitches, before they were beaten by England in the semi-final.']",[],72.0,127,12,6139.0,242*,53.38,11878,51.68,20,30,664,14,66.0,0.0,139.0,133,12,5554.0,145*,45.9,6723,82.61,11,37,509,46,54.0,0.0,57.0,55,7,1505.0,73*,31.35,1236,121.76,0,9,158,26,27.0,0.0,139.0,239,19,10924,284*,49.65,20946,52.15,30,57,1274,34,130.0,0.0,200.0,190,20,7675,145*,45.14,9366,81.94,15,49,675,67,81.0,0.0,169.0,161,19,4277,101*,30.11,3457,123.71,1,28,406,100,69,0,72.0,61,2079,1163,29.0,4/44,4/44,40.1,3.35,71.6,1,0,0,139.0,63,1377,1246,35.0,4/22,4/22,35.6,5.42,39.3,1,0,0,57.0,12,118,164,6.0,2/16,2/16,27.33,8.33,19.6,0,0,0,139.0,136,6552,3677,85,5/75,5/59,43.25,3.36,77.0,1,1,0,200.0,97,2666,2319,65,5/51,5/51,35.67,5.21,41.0,1,1,0,169.0,53,758,885,30,3/33,3/33,29.50,7.00,25.2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He was particularly lethal in a couple of sessions in the third Test in Rawalpindi, where he consistently swung the ball away, and snapped up a then career-best 4 for 63. In addition, his uninhibited batting and a megawatt smile endeared him to crowds in a manner even he found difficult to fathom. \n"", 'That comeback fades in comparison to the one he made in 2008-09. A stress fracture ruled him out of cricket in 2005, and threatened to end his career. For three years he could hardly play any cricket. He had to undergo a back surgery before which he was not sure he would be able to bowl again.

A successful Ranji season followed, and his 36 wickets at 17.50 took Tamil Nadu through to the semi-final. Eventually the national recall came, when Munaf Patel sustained a groin injury during the five-ODI series in Sri Lanka in January 2009. He then made it back to the Test squad for the tour of New Zealand, but never got a game. He captained the Tamil Nadu Ranji side, and reminded the selectors yet again that he wasn\'t a finished article, by bowling economically for Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 IPL.

As a result of this, when the ball swung away, or even straightened, he could be difficult to tackle. Not much of that has changed in his remodelled action.

His progress into the national side may have been steady and methodical rather than meteoric, but once there, Dravid established himself at the vanguard of a new, defiant generation that were no longer easybeats away from home. Armed with an orthodox technique drilled into him by Keki Tarapore, he became the cement that held the foundations firm while the flair players expressed themselves. Yet, for a man quickly stereotyped as one-paced and one-dimensional, he too could stroke the ball around when the mood struck him. \n', ""Never a natural athlete, he compensated with sheer hard work and powers of concentration that were almost yogic. At Adelaide in 2003, when India won a Test in Australia for the first time in a generation, he batted 835 minutes over two innings. A few months later, he was at the crease more than 12 hours for the 270 that clinched India's first series win in Pakistan.\nInitially seen as a liability in the one-day arena, he retooled his game over the years to become an adept middle-order finisher. The heaves and swipes didn't come naturally, but by the time the selectors eased him aside in early 2008, he had more than 10,000 runs to his name in the 50-over game. There had also been a lengthy phase where he donned the wicketkeeping gloves, helping the team to find a balance that was crucial in the run to the World Cup final in 2003."", ""However, it's his Test exploits that he will be most remembered for. After impressing in a Lord's debut where he was eclipsed by Sourav Ganguly, Dravid's breakthrough innings arrived at the Wanderers a few months later, against a South African attack accustomed to bullying visitors. A brief slump followed, but he emerged from that with perhaps one of the most famous supporting acts of all, to VVS Laxman in an Eden Gardens Test that rejuvenated Indian cricket. The half decade that followed was a golden one with the bat, as tours of England and Australia realised more than 600 runs."", ""A two-year stint as captain, following Ganguly's axing, was less successful, though he did lead the side to series victories in England and the West Indies for the first time in a generation. Just when it seemed his best was behind him, Dravid showed his class once again on the tour to England in 2011. In a series in which India were completely outplayed and none of their other batsmen scored more than 275 runs in the Tests, Dravid amassed 461, including three hundreds, two of them when opening the innings against a high-quality pace attack. However, that was followed by a poor series in Australia, which turned out to be his last, as he announced his retirement soon after returning to India."", ""Dravid's immense levels of concentration also came in handy when he was standing in the slips.

He has done so coming from the cricketing backwaters, the mining state of Jharkhand, and through a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scales the highs and lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India have won the top prize in all formats: the No.1 Test ranking for 18 months starting December 2009, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the World Twenty20 on his captaincy debut in 2007."", ' \n', 'Dhoni, then a ticket inspector with the Indian Railways, had escaped all attention bar the odd whisper among the followers of club cricket in Kolkata until he was 23 when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi in 2004. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 within a year of his debut.', ""Dhoni demonstrated all that was right with the new middle-class India. He didn't respect reputations, but never disrespected. He improvised, he learned, but didn't make an apology about his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He still batted with low, hockey hands, he still didn't look elegant but became a multi-faceted ODI batsman, one who could accumulate, one who could rebuild, and one who could still unleash those big sixes."", ""Along the way Dhoni showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up captaincy in 2007. Just before that announcement from Dravid, Dhoni had taken a bunch of kids to South Africa and was leading India to a World Cup win in a format the country didn't even take seriously. The ODI captaincy was natural progression, and Anil Kumble just kept the seat warm in Tests for a year."", ""Dhoni brought to captaincy a thick skin and relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with coach Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they returned the favour with some of their best years in international cricket. His calmness on the field helped and worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although tactically he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests. All that can't argue against the fact that India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under Dhoni, and that Dhoni has for years been among the best few ODI batsmen in the world."", ""However, post the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and his patented helicopter shot, reality struck, and an ageing team kept losing in unfamiliar conditions. After eight straight Test losses away from home, Dhoni the captain came under immense pressure, which was accentuated by a 2-1 home series loss to England in 2012-13, the first time India had lost at home in more than eight years. This brought out a new chapter in Dhoni's career wherein he seemed more assertive as a captain, started building a new team, played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to win four wins in a series. "", '  ', ""Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came close to wins on both tours. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests, dealing with the seam movement and bounce by stepping down the pitch and taking blows on his body.\n \nWins once again proved elusive on the tour of Australia that followed, though India competed ferociously thanks to a young batting core led by Virat Kohli. "", 'Kohli had captained the side in the first Test, with Dhoni injured, and he would lead them in the fourth and final Test too, with Dhoni making a surprise announcement after the third Test in Melbourne that he was retiring from the longest format.\n \nThough his game was not as suited to Tests as it was to limited-overs cricket, Dhoni ended his career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper, with 4876 runs at an average of just over 38, and six hundreds. He had also captained India to more Test wins - 27 - than anyone else.

Sourav Ganguly's ability to polarise opinion led to one of the most fascinating dramas in Indian cricket. Yet, nobody can dispute that he was India's most successful Test captain - forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented, but directionless, individuals - and nobody can argue about him being one of the greatest one-day batsmen of all time. Despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision in his strokeplay, his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at Lord's in 1996. Later that year, he was promoted to the top of the order in ODIs and, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed one of the most destructive opening pairs in history.  \n"", ""When he took over the captaincy after the match-fixing exposes in 2000, he quickly proved to be a tough, intuitive and uncompromising leader. Under his stewardship India started winning Test matches away, and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way to the World Cup final in 2003. Later that year, in Australia, an unexpected and incandescent hundred at Brisbane set the tone for the series where India fought the world's best team to a standstill. Victory in Pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of being a springboard for greater things, it was the peak of a slippery slope. "", ""The beginning of the end came in 2004 at Nagpur - when his last-minute withdrawal played a part in Australia clinching the series - and things went pear shaped when his loss of personal form coincided with India's insipid ODI performances. Breaking point was reached when his differences with Greg Chappell leaked into public domain and his career was in jeopardy when India began their remarkable revival under Rahul Dravid. "", ""His gritty 30s at Karachi, when India succumbed to a humiliating defeat in early 2006, weren't enough for him to retain his spot and some felt he would never get another chance. Others, as always, thought otherwise and they were proved right when he was included in the Test squad for the away series in South Africa in 2006-2007. He  ended as the highest Indian run-scorer in that series and capped his fairytale comeback with four half-centuries on his return to ODIs. He continued his fine run in England, where he finished as the second highest scorer in Tests, and went on to slam back-to-back hundreds against Pakistan at home, the second of which was a glorious 239 in Bangalore. Ganguly was surprisingly omitted from India's ODI squad for the CB Series in Australia and has been out of contention in the one-day squad since. After a poor Test series in Sri Lanka, there were reports of him considering retirement but he was given a lifeline in the Tests against Australia at home. Two days before the first Test, he said the series would be his last.  \n""]",[],113.0,188,17,7212.0,239,42.17,14070,51.25,16,35,900,57,71.0,0.0,311.0,300,23,11363.0,183,41.02,15416,73.70,22,72,1122,190,100.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,254.0,399,44,15687,239,44.18,,,33,89,,,168.0,0.0,437.0,421,43,15622,183,41.32,,,31,97,,,131.0,0.0,77.0,73,4,1726,91,25.01,1613,107.00,0,8,184,51,28,0,113.0,99,3117,1681,32.0,3/28,3/37,52.53,3.23,97.4,0,0,0,311.0,171,4561,3849,100.0,5/16,5/16,38.49,5.06,45.6,1,2,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,254.0,,11108,6099,167,6/46,,36.52,3.29,66.5,,4,0,437.0,,8199,6646,171,5/16,5/16,38.86,4.86,47.9,4,2,0,77.0,37,573,756,29,3/27,3/27,26.06,7.91,19.7,0,0,0,False,True,False,True

He opened well in all three forms of the game. He could be more aggressive than Virender Sehwag, played the kind of back-to-the-wall innings that would do Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman proud, and accumulated without taking any risks, much like Sachin Tendulkar has been doing in the last quarter of his career. Either side of that period, though, livid disappointment with his technical flaws dominating his other attributes. Still, with over 10000 runs from his 56 Tests, 147 ODIs and 37 T20Is - not to mention leading Kolkata Knight Riders to two IPL titles - Gambhir has been a grand contributor to Indian cricket.', ' \n', 'Gambhir almost did not make it, ""not wanting to play anymore"" when he was dropped for the 2007 World Cup. For about eight first years of his career, he was the domestic cheque that would not be honoured at international level. While the bowlers on the Ranji circuit swore by this little left-hand batsman, he had just two international centuries to show after 13 Tests and 19 ODIs when he was left out of the World Cup party.', 'He came back with massive runs in domestic cricket, a few important technical adjustments, and with the reputation of being the best player of spin in India, outside the international side. A century in his second ODI back and a final-winning fifty in the inaugural World Twenty20 paved the way for his Test return. Test fifties against Murali and Mendis in the summer of Murali and Mendis in 2008 told him he belonged. In his next 13 Tests, he scored eight centuries: centuries to set up wins, centuries to bat opposition out, and centuries to hold on for draws, including the near 11-hour marathon in Napier. The Arjuna Award came his way, the ICC named him the Test player of 2009, but much more tellingly Sehwag called him the best Indian Test opener since Sunil Gavaskar. He scored a match-winning 97 in the 2011 World Cup final.\n', ""After the World Cup, though, began a more serious, almost terminal decline. As the Indian Test side went from sublime to ridiculous, Gambhir's failures went unpunished. In England and Australia, where India lost eight continuous Tests, Gambhir was a walking wicket, poking at deliveries outside off. From being a captaincy candidate at one time, he went to struggling to keep his place in the side. "", ' ', 'With the arrivals of M Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan, Gambhir was sidelined until an England tour in 2014 when he was called-up as back-up opener. But his return after more than a year out of international cricket ended on a sour note when he was dropped after four innings. Gambhir was on far firmer ground in the IPL - having been a mainstay at Delhi Daredevils and then going to Knight Riders for a record US $2.4 million in the 2011 auction. Gambhir went into the 2016 IPL with 39 fifty-plus scores - the second-most by an Indian in all T20 cricket.

Kuruvilla took 35 wickets in his first full season for Bombay in 1991-92 and although widely expected to make the tour of South Africa in 1992-93, was overlooked. \n', 'After trying out a whole flotilla of new ball bowlers without success in the\nfollowing years, the selectors finally gave the gangling Mumbaikar a break on  the 1996-97 West Indies tour. Kuruvilla emerged as a key figure in the Indian attack and a haul of 5 for 68 in the second innings of the third Test at Bridgetown set up a winning position for India, but the batsmen contrived to throw it away. He played five more Tests against Sri Lanka at home and away in the following season where he did creditably considering the flat shirtfronts on offer but, surprisingly, he was never considered again. Soft spoken and self effacing, Kuruvilla had no regrets for the shabby treatment meted out to him.\n""At least I played for a year. There are so many good cricketers who don\'t get to play even one game for India. I can\'t complain on that count"", was his classic refrain in humility.

Like the great tall wristspinners Bill O'Reilly and his own idol BS Chandrasekhar, Kumble traded the legspinner's proverbial yo-yo for a spear, as the ball hacked through the air rather than hanging in it and came off the pitch with a kick rather than a kink. The method provided him stunning success, particularly on Indian soil, where his deliveries burst like packets of water upon the feeblest hint of a crack, and more than one modern-day batsman remarked that there was no more difficult challenge in cricket than handling Kumble on a wearing surface. \n"", ""Kumble's prodigious capacity to bear pain was proved in Antigua in 2002 when he bandaged his fractured jaw to deliver a stirring spell, and that to continuously learn in the mid-2000s when, after a decade of middling away performances, he influenced memorable wins in Headingley, Adelaide, Multan and Kingston, using an improved googly, bigger sidespin and more variation in flight and on the crease."", ""In a brilliant though always downplayed career Kumble claimed virtually every Indian record. In 1999 in Delhi he swallowed all ten wickets in an innings against Pakistan. In December 2001, on home turf in Bangalore, he became the India's first spinner to take 300 Test wickets. A year later, almost to the day, he became the first to do so in one-dayers. In August 2007 at The Oval he went past Glenn McGrath's 563 wickets and in January 2008 he broke the 600 barrier, to stand behind only Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan, emphasising his contribution to spin's golden era. And at The Oval he chalked up what, judging by the pure ecstasy of his reaction and the dressing room's, was perhaps his most cherished feat of all - a Test century that had been 17 years and 118 matches in the coming."", ""Less than a month after his 37th birthday, he received the ultimate honour when he was named India's Test captain for the home series against Pakistan. He went on to win the series, the first home triumph against Pakistan in 27 years, before playing a big role in holding the side together during the controversial series in Australia. He was also India's leading wicket-taker with 20 in the four Tests."", 'His form, however, slipped during the tour of Sri Lanka and there were calls for him to quit after a wicketless performance in the Bangalore Test against Australia. A shoulder injury added fuel to the fire and an upset Kumble reacted sharply, saying that he had it in him to continue for a while longer. However, he changed his mind during the Delhi Test and announced his retirement, fittingly at his favourite venue. He finished his career as the third-highest Test wicket-taker (619), behind Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne.', ""After his international retirement, Kumble continued to be actively involved in the game. In 2010, he was elected president of the Karnataka State Cricket Association and served a three-year term in that capacity.

A stable head, sure footwork and firm wrists are part of Kohli's arsenal, which helps him play an array of audacious shots."", ""Fluent all around the ground, Kohli is equally confident off the front and back foot. And he isn't shy to move away from tradition and take guard a yard outside his crease, as he did on the tour of Australia in 2014-15. Having been embarrassed by James Anderson in England, he made this technical adjustment on the advice of India coach Ravi Shastri, and scored four centuries including twin hundreds in Adelaide. He finished the series as the second-highest run-getter behind Smith, as Australia won 2-0."", 'Since then, and in no small measure helped by playing Tests at home, India have won series against South Africa, England, Australia and New Zealand while winning away in the West Indies and twice in Sri Lanka.', 'The biggest turning point - and probably the most pivotal moment - of Kohli\'s career arrived on December 30, 2014, when MS Dhoni announced his unexpected retirement from Tests following the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Kohli could not believe that Dhoni would no longer wear whites, and that he would now lead India. The second thought made him cry. ""If you told me when I started playing cricket that at 26 I will be Test captain of India... no chance,"" is how he later described his feelings.', '""A brat, arrogant and casual"" was how Kohli described himself in 2008, when he then became the second India captain to lift the Under-19 World Cup. He excelled in the IPL for Royal Challengers Bangalore, which put him on the world map and made sponsors line up at his doorstep, making him a brand even before he had established himself in international cricket. But as he steadily grew to become India\'s most dependable batsman, and not just a brand, Kohli realised he needed to rid of old, bad habits. He lost weight, gained focus and became a relentless force, supremely fit and quick across the turf, and perhaps the hungriest batsman in the world when it comes to converting ones into twos.', 'The IPL helped Kohli, like many other Indians, play positively. He is certain that his 52-ball 100* in a chase of 360 against Australia in the Jaipur ODI of 2013 (still the fastest by an Indian) was only possible because of his post-IPL mindset. In 2016, Kohli smacked four centuries in the tournament, having not scored even a single ton in his first eight seasons. When Royal Challengers finished as runners-up in 2016, Kohli was just 27 runs short of reaching an unprecedented 1000 runs for the season.', 'Kohli has played with men who presented him awards when he was a chubby-faced schoolboy, and some of the same men have ended up playing under his captaincy. Under Kohli, India have ascended to the No. 1 Test ranking and held onto it with an iron grip while also reaching the joint top position in ODIs. He has set his sights quite a bit higher, though: his quest is to create a legacy like the ones established by all-conquering captains like Clive Lloyd and Steve Waugh.\n']",['ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year 2012'],77.0,131,8,6613.0,243,53.76,11549,57.26,25,20,731,19,72.0,0.0,227.0,219,37,10843.0,183,59.57,11664,92.96,41,49,1019,116,111.0,0.0,67.0,62,17,2263.0,90*,50.28,1647,137.4,0,20,223,54,33.0,0.0,109.0,179,15,8862,243,54.03,15452,57.35,32,28,1044,34,103.0,0.0,261.0,252,40,12285,183,57.94,13200,93.06,45,57,1183,140,129.0,0.0,253.0,239,46,7911,113,40.98,5924,133.54,4,58,727,251,115,0,77.0,9,163,76,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.79,-,0,0,0,227.0,48,641,665,4.0,1/15,1/15,166.25,6.22,160.2,0,0,0,67.0,12,146,198,4.0,1/13,1/13,49.50,8.13,36.5,0,0,0,109.0,23,631,330,3,1/19,2/42,110.00,3.13,210.3,0,0,0,261.0,55,705,726,4,1/15,1/15,181.50,6.17,176.2,0,0,0,253.0,44,454,661,8,2/25,2/25,82.62,8.73,56.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He might not quite have the skills of Wasim Akram, who he has often been compared to, but mentally Zaheer has become as good as Akram. He knows how to get wickets, he has an intuitive sense of when to go for the kill, and once a batsman has shown him the slightest hint of a weakness, Zaheer preys on it ruthlessly. Unlike the Pakistan fast bowlers of the 2000s, though, he stays away from controversy and is pretty low-key off the field.\n\xa0 \n', ""Zaheer's career can be easily divided into three distinct sections, neatly segregated by injuries.

The new, lethal Zaheer was not only the leader of the Indian attack, he was one of the best in the world. With his guidance, India claimed the No. 1 ranking in Tests and the World Cup in 2011, which he called ""my greatest cricketing moment.""', ""\nZaheer was seen as a vital resource ahead of a lengthy Test season comprising a four-Test tour of England and then a four-Test tour of Australia in 2011-12.

It wasn't until Zaheer's return for the Johannesburg Test against South Africa that India could stem their run of Test losses overseas. At 35 years, he still had all the tricks but his pace was down and he looked rather spent even while playing the second of back-to-back Tests in Durban.\n\xa0"", 'There was no doubting how much Zaheer prized Test cricket though.

Kaif's assured strokeplay, and composure that belied his age, earned him a Test cap against South Africa when he was only 20.

Wristy, willowy and sinuous, he can match - sometimes even better - Tendulkar for strokeplay. His on-side game is comparable to his idol Azharuddin's, yet he is decidedly more assured on the off side and has the rare gift of being able to hit the same ball to either side. The Australians, who have suffered more than most, paid the highest compliment after India's 2003-04 tour Down Under by admitting they did not know where to bowl to him. Laxman, a one-time medical student, finally showed signs of coming to terms with his considerable gifts in March 2001, as he tormented Steve Waugh's thought-to-be-invincible Australians with a majestic 281 to stand the Kolkata Test on its head. But even though he had another wonderful series against the Australians in 2003-04 with two centuries, one of them involving a back-from-the-dead, match-winning, 300-plus partnership with Kolkata ally Rahul Dravid at Adelaide, he hasn't quite managed the consistency that could have turned him into a batting great.  Between dazzling and sometimes workmanlike hundreds, he has suffered the frustration of numerous twenties and thirties and has lost his place in the one-day side. Nothing, though, has deterred him from tormenting his favourite opponents with silken strokes and piles of runs: in the course of the double-hundred at Feroz Shah Kotla in 2008, he became the second Indian batsman after Tendulkar to score more than 2000 runs against the Australians. A couple of years later, batting with a runner due to back spasms, he conjured up a magical unbeaten 73 in a thrilling run-chase in Mohali. \n"", 'However, in 2011 the runs dried up in two successive overseas trips - in eight innings in England he scored 182, and then the poor run continued in his favourite country and against his favourite opponent, Australia.

But with all those gifts came a curse - his brittle body, which may well have contributed to him playing his last Test in 2004. Still T20 cricket, which has a cap of only four overs, gave Nehra a lifeline and at 36 he revived his international career because he had reprised the ability to move the ball at 140 kph, and became one of India\'s most successful bowlers in the 2016 World T20.\n \nNehra came out of his first full tour - to Zimbabwe in 2000-01 - with his reputation as one of the most promising new-ball bowlers on the international circuit vastly enhanced, and his performance in Bulawayo played a key role in India winning a Test outside the subcontinent for the first time in 15 years. He struggled to establish himself thereafter, as inconsistency and injuries saw him slip down the pace bowling list.\n \nThe high point of that difficult period came in the 2003 World Cup against England, where he scalped 6 for 23 and then threw up by the side of the pitch. Surgery on a troublesome ankle, and an indifferent tour of Australia followed, and Nehra\'s status as an automatic pick was lost. He pulled out midway through the 2005 Zimbabwe tour and had a succession of operations on his ankle that slowed down his career. He hit the headlines with creditable showings in the IPL, particularly in the second season, and was recalled to the ODI squad for the tour of West Indies in June 2009 and found his mojo again.\n \nHis 31 ODI wickets in 2009 were the most he had ever taken in a year, and he followed it up with 28 dismissals in 2010 to establish his place in India\'s 2011 World Cup squad. He bowled a match-winning spell against Pakistan in the semi-final, but his body failed him again - an on-field injury prevented him from playing the final, which India won to become world champions.\n \nIt was long thought that was the end of Nehra, but he willed himself back into contention picking up 22 wickets for Chennai Super Kings in 2015 - the most by an Indian fast bowler. ""I don\'t know what has happened. Whether it is my face, I don\'t know,"" he joked on being ignored by India\'s selectors in June. Six months later - and four years since his last appearance for India - he was brought back to the fold for a tour of Australia. With his help, India won their first limited-overs trophy Down Under and Nehra continued his fine form into the Asia Cup and the 2016 World T20. \n', ""Nehra was a key player for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the first part of their triumphant 2016 IPL campaign before an injury halted his season. He underwent surgery on his right knee in London, and didn't play any serious cricket for the rest of the year, but India's selectors retained enough faith in him to pick him for the T20 series against England in January 2017.""]",[],17.0,25,11,77.0,19,5.5,256,30.07,0,0,8,3,5.0,0.0,120.0,46,21,141.0,24,5.64,246,57.31,0,0,12,3,18.0,0.0,27.0,5,0,28.0,22,5.60,39,71.79,0,0,1,2,4.0,0.0,90.0,109,31,756,57,9.69,,,0,1,,,25.0,0.0,201.0,87,35,463,37*,8.90,,,0,0,,,37.0,0.0,132.0,28,15,69,22*,5.30,102,67.64,0,0,4,3,27,0,17.0,29,3447,1866,44.0,4/72,6/117,42.4,3.24,78.3,2,0,0,120.0,120,5751,4981,157.0,6/23,6/23,31.72,5.19,36.6,5,2,0,27.0,27,588,758,34.0,3/19,3/19,22.29,7.73,17.2,0,0,0,90.0,,16966,8832,303,7/14,,29.14,3.12,55.9,,14,4,201.0,,9701,8086,245,6/23,6/23,33.00,5.00,39.5,9,2,0,132.0,132,2845,3653,162,4/10,4/10,22.54,7.70,17.5,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

Indeed, his approach came as a whiff of fresh air and, not unexpectedly, he was a great crowd puller. A swashbuckling opening batsman cast in the Mushtaq Ali mould, Srikkanth could destroy the strongest and most fearsome attacks in the world by fearless pulling, hooking and driving. But there were times when he could be dismissed by some pretty ordinary bowling. Gifted with a good eye and super-quick reflexes, Srikkanth's buccaneering methods quickly caught the eye of the selectors and he made his international debut at 21. Consistency however was not his watchword and he was more out of than in the Indian team. But by the mid 80s, his attacking methods had acquired some discipline and he remained the regular opening batsman till 1989. Appointed captain for the tour of Pakistan that year he achieved a major triumph when the team drew all the four Tests. But the selectors pounced on his batting failures and he only made it back after two years in the wilderness. By this time he was over 30 and he did not have the reflexes of old. And when he was not selected for the South Zone team in 1993, Srikkanth, at 33, announced his retirement. If his Test record is impressive, given his sometimes outrageous batting style, he was a natural for the limited-overs game. At the time he quit the scene, Srikkanth had scored more runs and more centuries than any other Indian cricketer and he made them in double-quick time exasperating some of the finest and fastest bowlers in the game. He was one of the heroes of the World Cup triumph in 1983 and also played in the competition in 1987 and 1992. After leaving the game, Srikkanth has worked as a cricket analyst for various Indian news channels and in February 2008, was named the ambassador for the Chennai Super Kings franchise of the Indian Premier League.

The year was one of several highlights, including a haul of eight wickets against South Africa in Johannesburg, which helped India win their first Test in the country.', 'However, things turned sour two years later in the inaugural IPL, when he was involved in a spat with Harbhajan Singh, who slapped him at the end of a match. Sreesanth signed with Warwickshire and enjoyed a satisfactory first season, but injuries and a steady decline in form kept him out of the national team. His problems with discipline are well documented; he was warned by the BCCI with suspension from domestic cricket if he violated the code of conduct. But his ability with the ball continued to keep him in contention for a place in the Indian team in Tests and ODIs.', ""The biggest shock in his volatile career came when he was among three Rajasthan Royals players arrested in May 2013, along with Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan, for the alleged fulfilling of promises made to bookmakers in the IPL.

He cracked eight sixes in 124 against Sri Lanka - Muralitharan and all - in 1993-94, and hammered four fifties in five innings against the Australians in 1997-98, singling out Shane Warne for a personalised spanking.

His domestic exploits soon caught the selectors\' notice, and he made to the Indian squad for the tour to Pakistan.

In his time he was very much the glamour boy of Indian cricket, tall and good-looking and with an image to match.

It all came together finally in 2013, when Rohit was promoted to open the innings in ODIs. The move turned out to be a masterstroke, as Rohit found form in the Champions Trophy, and then went into overdrive in the ODI series against Australia, scoring two centuries, including 209, only the third double in ODI cricket. That led to a place in the Test team, and Rohit responded by scoring centuries in his first two Test innings, becoming the fifth batsman to do so. A year later, he became the first batsman to hit two ODI double-hundreds, in an innings where he smashed the record for the highest score with 264 off 173 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens.    \n', ""For the first six years of his career, though, Rohit struggled to come up with the sort of numbers which would justify his talent.

"", ""He pressed a claim for higher things through two centuries in the 2008-09 Ranji final, a feat last achieved by Sachin Tendulkar and only four others before him. However, his lack of consistency meant he wasn't a part of India's World Cup-winning squad, and returned to national duty only when the top players were rested on the tour to the West Indies in 2011. There, he made his presence felt with consistent scores in the ODIs and the Man-of-the-Series award. But his form continued to fluctuate in the months that followed, and he remained one of India's most promising but unfulfilled talents over the next couple of years. All that changed in 2013, and with Tendulkar retiring from Tests and ODIs that year, Rohit looked set to be a permanent fixture in the Indian team across formats."", ""Then came the 2015 World Cup and Rohit ended up as India's second-highest run-scorer, with an impressive 137 against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals, further cementing his place in the top order.

His good looks (he was a pop singer and a film actor), aggressive batsmanship and a penchant for big hits made Patil a natural crowd puller. An instant success after making his Test debut and on his first tour, he took 174 off Dennis Lillee and Len Pascoe at Adelaide. It was a remarkable innings given that in the previous Test he was concussed by a bouncer from Pascoe after scoring 65.  After a moderate series against England in 1981-82 he was dropped but was back for the tour of there in 1982. And at Old Trafford he came up with another memorable display, hitting an undefeated 129, in the process taking 24 runs (4440444) off an over from Bob Willis - the third delivery being a no ball. He did reasonably well on the tour of Pakistan in 1982-83 but because of personal problems he dropped out of the team to tour West Indies in 1983.  Back for the World Cup in 1983, Patil was one of the heroes of that triumph. But in the Tests against Pakistan and West Indies in 1983-84, his aggressive batting was laced with a bit of indiscipline and he could not maintain his place in the side.  And though he did reasonably well against England the following season, he was dropped after two games and was never considered for Tests again, though he was picked for the tour of England in 1986 when he played only in the one-day games. \n', ""A stalwart for Bombay for several years, Patil in the last few seasons of his first-class career captained Madhya Pradesh with much success. After retirement, Patil served first as India A coach, then coach of the Indian team, before moving on to take charge of Kenya. He resigned after taking them to the semi-final of the 2003 World Cup, and returned to India for the next 18 months, but an uncertain future with India A meant that he went back to a minnow, Oman this time, in the Intercontinental Cup and helped them qualify for the ICC Trophy after some strong performances in the ACC Trophy. Patil went on to serve as the coach of the Mumbai Champs in the ICL, but returned to the mainstream when he cut ties with the unofficial league in 2009.

Standing at 6\'4"", his rhythmic, high-arm action allowed him to bowl at around 140 kph. For one who started serious cricket at 14, his rise was rapid and he made his Ranji Trophy debut at 18. An injury to Munaf Patel provided him an opening during India\'s tour of Bangladesh in May 2007 but it was in Australia where he caught the attention, prompting Steve Waugh to call him the next best thing in Indian cricket. He showed he could move the ball both ways and his probing spell in the second innings in Perth, where he set-up Ricky Ponting, is the stuff of folklore. He continued to impress in the one-day series, clocking more than 150kph once, and ended as India\'s highest wicket-taker in the triumphant campaign.  \n', ""The glory days continued through his debut season, with a notable performance against South Africa, followed by 15 wickets in four Tests in the succesful home series against Australia in 2008, and a couple of strong shows in Sri Lanka in ODIs. By now Ishant was clearly Zaheer Khan's deputy in the Indian seam arsenal, but things have gone seriously wrong since. Some have blamed it on his being over-bowled, particularly on flat tracks in the IPL, while others point to a malaise that has afflicted all of India's new crop of fast bowlers. The fact remains that Ishant lost the most crucial aspect of his bowling - his pace. Without it, his natural short-of-a-good-length that had tormented batsmen of Ponting's calibre a season earlier lost its venom. Eventually the loss of pace led to a loss of self-confidence. The Indian selectors decided to be careful and began shielding him from the shorter formats of the game in 2009 in the hope that he would rediscover his zip. His struggle continued but given India's limited seam-bowling resources at the time, Ishant was persisted with, even after an ankle surgery in 2012 that put him out of action for months. When he completed 50 Tests in early 2013 he had among the worst averages for bowlers with 50 Test caps to their name."", ""Since then Ishant has somewhat revived his Test career. He was impressive on the tour of New Zealand, being the top wicket-taker in Tests with 15 wickets that included two five-wicket hauls. On his next overseas assignment, in England, Ishant was the hero of India's famous win at Lord's when he bounced out the England batsmen with his spell of 7 for 74, helping India to a 1-0 lead in the Test series. It was perhaps one of his best performances for India in whites.  "", 'He soon suffered a leg injury and was ruled out for the following two Tests. He did return for the fifth Test but his 4 for 96 was only part of an embarrassing innings defeat for India. He then went back to Australia, the country that had kick-started his career, but he could only manage mediocre performances in the three Tests he was a part of. His landing foot was proving to be a constant irritant to his fitness and the fast bowler picked up another injury, this time to his knee and was ruled out of the ODI tri-series that followed.

Within a couple of years in international cricket, he was thought of as a possible successor to Kapil in the all-round department. There was talent to back the hype: cast your mind back to January 2006, when the lethal curve of his late swing consumed, off the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of the Karachi Test, Salman Butt, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf; or to the previous Test in Faisalabad, where his 210-run partnership with MS Dhoni steered India past the follow-on mark. \n', ' \nBut a number of factors, not least the constant injuries that Kapil miraculously avoided, meant Irfan never really fulfilled his potential, and by his late 20s was more or less confined to bits-and-pieces roles in various IPL teams.', "" \nIrfan was 19 when he made his Test debut in Australia, but already looked the part, bowling at a brisk pace and troubling quality batsmen with his left-arm swing.

He was more than just a clean ball-striker, though, and his sensible, straight-bat approach often bailed India out of strife in Tests as well.', "" \nBut, either side of that Karachi hat-trick, his bowling form nosedived, with his pace dropping significantly, and he struggled to make both the Test and ODI teams by the time 2006 had ended. He was sent back from the tour of South Africa in 2006 to focus on domestic cricket. He made the 2007 World Cup squad but didn't figure in a single game during India's disappointing campaign, and was thereafter dropped from both the Test and ODI sides."", ' \nRecalled for the inaugural World T20 in September 2007, Pathan did not disappoint, snapping up 10 wickets at 14.90.

A back injury forced him to spend eight months on the sidelines after the 2010 IPL, and he missed the entire domestic season. That did not stop him from being bought for $1.9 million by Delhi Daredevils at the 2011 IPL auction in January. After a mixed IPL season, he impressed during the 2011-12 Ranji Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker after four rounds of the tournament. His performances earned him a recall to the national side when he was picked for the final two ODIs against the West Indies in December, 2011. He came into his own during the one-day series in Sri Lanka in 2012, finishing as the highest wicket-taker and most economical bowler. He played the 2012 World T20 - also in Sri Lanka - and played all of India's games in the tournament, before injury struck once more."", ' \nIrfan has played no international cricket since then, but remains, like his brother Yusuf, a sought-after name at the IPL.

Initially, Parthiv's glovework varied from competent to shoddy, but it was his ability with the bat that got him an extended run with the national side. But, his increasingly sloppy work behind the stumps saw him lose his place in 2004, and with the emergence of Dinesh Karthik and then MS Dhoni, Parthiv went further down in the pecking order. \n"", ""Parthiv made sporadic comebacks but with Dhoni firmly entrenched in the limited-overs sides, he had to compete for the second keeper's slot with Wriddhiman Saha - who became the first-choice wicket-keeper in Tests following Dhoni's retirement - Naman Ojha and Karthik. Parthiv tweaked his training methods - he split his day into two exclusive sessions of batting and keeping - to ensure optimum fitness and performance levels, and it began to pay off. "", ""In IPL 2015, Parthiv, after a lukewarm beginning, struck form in the latter half of the tournament and tallied 339 runs to finish as the fourth-leading batsman in Mumbai Indians' victorious campaign. Later in the year, Parthiv brought up his first List-A hundred to lead Gujarat to their maiden Vijay Hazare Trophy title. The runs began to flow as he racked up four fifties from nine innings in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament and a century against India A in the Deodhar Trophy. "", ""In February 2016, four years after he last played an international game, Parthiv's consistency was rewarded with a call-up to India's squad as a stand-by for the injured Dhoni. He began the 2016-17 Ranji Trophy well with the bat, too, with three fifties and a hundred in his first five games, and got an even bigger reward when he was called up to the Test team during the home series against England, when Saha was injured.

Kiran More had seen him bowl in the nets and sent him straight to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai to train under TA Sekhar and Dennis Lillee. Soon he was being hailed as the fastest man in Indian cricket. Then, even as Baroda and Gujarat vied for his services, Munaf chose Mumbai, after Sachin Tendulkar had taken special interest in him and had a word with the authorities in the Mumbai Cricket Association. Even then Munaf's first-class career was anything but smooth as he spent more time recovering from various injuries than actually playing. \n"", ""Strongly built though not overly tall, Munaf gradually gathers momentum in his approach to the crease, before releasing the ball with a windmill-whirl of the hands. His priority, in his early years, was to bowl quick. And it was this that first caught the eye of More and others. Later, he added reverse swing to his repertoire and troubled batsmen with a well-directed yorker. After plenty of speculation and close calls he finally received a call from the national selection panel for the second Test against England in March 2006, after an impressive performance for the Board President's XI saw him pick up 10 English wickets for 91 runs. In Mohali a week later, he ended with 7 for 97, the best performance by an Indian fast bowler on Test debut. A consistent series against West Indies later that year meant Munaf had established himself as a regular member of the side. "", ""Then came the lull as Munaf, like most of India's new crop of fast bowlers, began to fade away after a good start. He lost pace at an alarming rate, and seemed intent on rebranding himself as back-up seamer as opposed to a pace spearhead. He soon lost his place in the Test side, and despite a handful of average ODI performances, was a left-field selection for the New Zealand tour in 2009. He did a reasonable job in India's win in Hamilton, but a schedule packed with the occasional home Tests in between ODIs and Twenty20s meant he rarely stayed in the radar for long. Injuries to Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth in the lead-up to the Sri Lanka tour in 2010 gave him another opportunity to impress."", ""Munaf's career continued to be dogged by injuries, but in an ironic twist, he was the beneficiary of one when Praveen Kumar was forced out of India's 2011 World Cup squad. In stepped Munaf to take his place as India's third seamer and he ended the tournament as India's third-highest wicket-taker behind Zaheer and Yuvraj Singh, with 11 scalps. His consistent performances prompted bowling coach Eric Simons to call him the unsung hero of India's World Cup victory."", 'Yet again, though, the high did not last long and within a few months Munaf was once again dropped from the national side in all three formats.

With minimal footwork but maximum intent, he has piled Test runs at a faster pace than anyone in the history of cricket. Bowlers must always fancy their chances against a batsman who plays so many strokes; it's just that Sehwag fancies his chances against them much more. \n"", 'As a starry-eyed youngster from Najafgarh, where his family ran a flour mill, Sehwag grew up, like many others from his generation, wanting to be Sachin Tendulkar. Indeed, when he scored his first one-day hundred, filling up for his injured idol against New Zealand in Sri Lanka, he could have been mistaken for him: there was the same back-foot punch on the off side, the minimalistic straight drive and the wristy whip to the leg. And on his Test debut, on a fiery pitch in Bloemfontein, he matched the master stroke for stroke as they both blazed away to hundreds. But soon he emerged his own man, and not long after Tendulkar was playing a supporting, and somewhat calming, hand as Sehwag romped away to a triple-hundred, the first by an Indian, in Multan, bringing it up with a six. Two Tests ago, he had been dismissed trying the same stroke five short of what would have been his first Test double-hundred.', ""His uncomplicated approach - batting is all about scoring as many runs as quickly as possible - belies a sharp and street-smart cricket mind. He has a keen grasp of his own, and his opponents', strengths and weaknesses and exploits them in a forensic manner. What appears risky to many, is merely an opportunity for him, and his lack of footwork, which does get him in trouble against the moving ball, is mostly an advantage, for it creates space for his brilliant handwork. Few batsmen have hit the ball harder square on the off side, and fewer still have hit them as frequently. And the sight of a spinner brings the savage out in him: and for many spectacular assaults against the world's leading spinners, there have numerous outrageous dismissals against the not-so-reputed ones."", ""The most remarkable aspect of Sehwag's career of course has been his ability to build massive scores at breathtaking speed. He holds the Indian record for highest number of Test double-hundreds, and came within seven runs of becoming the first batsman to score three triple-hundreds. That innings, against Sri Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, epitomised the Sehwag brand of batsmanship: a mix of imagination, daring, power, skills, and clarity of vision. His ODI career doesn't have as many high points, and yet he held the record for the highest score in that format at one point, scoring an astonishing 219 against West Indies in Indore. The most remarkable feature of the innings was the ease with which he reached the landmark, completing his double-hundred with more than six overs to spare.  "", 'Sehwag is equally refreshing off the field and shares his views on the game in an endearingly direct and candid manner, a rare trait among contemporary cricketers. He is, in every sense, a true original.']",['ICC Test Player of the Year 2010'],104.0,180,6,8586.0,319,49.34,10441,82.23,23,32,1233,91,91.0,0.0,251.0,245,9,8273.0,219,35.05,7929,104.33,15,38,1132,136,93.0,0.0,19.0,18,0,394.0,68,21.88,271,145.38,0,2,43,16,2.0,0.0,194.0,321,11,14683,319,47.36,,,42,55,,,166.0,0.0,332.0,321,14,10454,219,34.05,,,16,57,,,120.0,0.0,159.0,157,6,4061,122,26.89,2747,147.83,2,24,487,147,42.0,0.0,104.0,91,3731,1894,40.0,5/104,5/118,47.35,3.04,93.2,0,1,0,251.0,146,4392,3853,96.0,4/6,4/6,40.13,5.26,45.7,1,0,0,19.0,1,6,20,0.0,-,-,-,20.0,-,0,0,0,194.0,,8614,4470,105,5/104,,42.57,3.11,82.0,,1,0,332.0,,6009,5154,142,4/6,4/6,36.29,5.14,42.3,3,0,0,159.0,28,358,496,22,3/14,3/14,22.54,8.31,16.2,0,0,0,False,True,False,True

Raju was probably at his best during the 1994-95 series against the West Indies, when in three Tests, he claimed 20 wickets. However since then, his appearances have been sporadic and he was a forgotten man after the 1997-98 series against Australia. Around the domestic circuit however Raju continued to be Hyderabad's bowling mainstay and played a stellar role in the side making the final in the 1999-2000 Ranji Trophy season, with a bag of 52 wickets.

An attacking left-hander who goes for the big shots with impunity and clears the field with a swashbuckling flourish when at the top of his game, Raina is also equally capable of attracting applause as an electric fielder in the circle. All of this, though, is tempered with an iffy technique against the short ball, which has been mercilessly exposed in Test cricket. \n', ""It took him five years to cement his place as an India regular, moving from a limited-overs specialist who played 98 ODIs to one who became the 12th Indian to make a Test century on debut. Raina made his Test debut in Sri Lanka as a replacement for injured team-mate Yuvraj Singh, who, like Raina, was a left-hander, a dasher, and in the early 2000s, India's most athletic fielder.

The ability to split the field and discover gaps where fielders could not be placed earned him high praise when he first burst through to play for India in December 2006. The early years, however, weren't so prolific, which led to his omission from the 2007 World Cup. He forced his way back with a mountain of runs in domestic cricket, and from June 2008 was prolific in ODIs too, enhancing his stature as one of India's responsible gen-next batsmen. Also helping his cause were three supremely successful seasons for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL and in the Champions League. He was one of the four players retained by the franchise for the 2011 season."", ""His tenacity at the worst of times is typical of someone who has spent his teenage years living away from home in the demanding world of the Uttar Pradesh sports hostel, where a lack of facilities or grooming produces cricketers who must match talent with determination. At the under-19 level, Raina was prodigious with his run-scoring and a string of double-hundreds took him to the Indian junior team and beyond it, to India colours.

","[""\nSachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke - the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it's because he was equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox shots (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and can pull them out at will.  \n"", ""There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could score all around the wicket, off both front foot and back, could tune his technique to suit every condition, temper his game to suit every situation, and made runs in all parts of the world in all conditions."", 'Some of his finest performances came against Australia, the overwhelmingly dominant team of his era. His century as a 19-year-old on a lightning-fast pitch at the WACA is considered one of the best innings ever to have been played in Australia. A few years later he received the ultimate compliment from the ultimate batsman: Don Bradman confided to his wife that Tendulkar reminded him of himself.', 'Blessed with the keenest of cricket minds, and armed with a loathing for losing, Tendulkar set about doing what it took to become one of the best batsmen in the world. His greatness was established early: he was only 16 when he made his Test debut. He was hit on the mouth by Waqar Younis but continued to bat, in a blood-soaked shirt. His first Test hundred, a match-saving one at Old Trafford, came when he was 17, and he had 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25. In 2000 he became the first batsman to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian Lara as the leading Test run-scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs 30,000 international runs, and 50 Test hundreds.', ""He currently holds the record for most hundreds in both Tests and ODIs - remarkable, considering he didn't score his first ODI hundred till his 79th match. Incredibly, he retained a divine enthusiasm for the game till his last match. At 36 years and 306 days he broke a 40-year-old barrier by scoring the first double-century in one-day cricket. In 2012, when just one month short of his 39th birthday, he became the first player to score 100 international centuries, which like Bradman's batting average, could be a mark that lasts for ever. Later that year, though, he announced his retirement from ODIs after a disappointing 18 months in international cricket. And on November 16, 2013, Tendulkar retired from Test cricket after a memorable 200th Test, on his home ground at the Wankhede Stadium against West Indies. "", ""Tendulkar's considerable achievements seem greater still when looked at in the light of the burden of expectations he had to bear from his adoring but somewhat unreasonable followers, who have been prone to regard anything less than a hundred in each innings as a failure.

Making his first-class debut in 2004-05, he quickly established himself by taking more than 20 wickets in each of his first three first-class seasons. Vinay soon added the inswinger to his repertoire, and his consistency earned him an IPL contract with Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2008. His first defining domestic season was in 2009-10, where he captured 46 wickets, besides mentoring his fast-bowling colleagues, Abhimanyu Mithun and S Aravind, to lead Karnataka to the Ranji Trophy final for the first time in 11 years.  Some good performances in IPL 2010 earned him a spot in India's squad for the World T20 in West Indies, but he has not been able to hold it down consistently. His most recent international appearance came in 2013.

Vinay's own contribution with the ball was noteworthy as he picked up 29 and 48 wickets respectively, but it did not lead to a national recall. Vinay finished as Karnataka's leading wicket-taker in the 2015-16 domestic season as well but the team failed to make the knockouts of the Ranji Trophy and could not add any other domestic title to their kitty. Vinay had an underwhelming IPL 2015, too, taking only seven wickets in 13 matches after Mumbai Indians acquired him from Kolkata Knight Riders.

In one-day cricket he invariably raises the tempo in the lower middle-order. He is strong off his legs and relishes short bowling.

In a team of reverse-swingers he is the only English-type seamer, virtuous in his pursuit of line and length. He is a useful fielder and, close in, he rarely misses an opportunity to enquire about the batsman's health. During a one-month stint as a Surrey overseas player in 2002 he took 8 for 61 against Lancashire, then turned out for them for two seasons full-time as Pakistan's mercurial lost faith in him for reasons that have never quite been made clear. He signed with Surrey again for 2005, and later applied for British citizenship after marrying his British wife. He signed for Kent in late 2007.

That was the season he began opening regularly for Khan Research Laboratories, a move that fetched him two hundreds and two fifties in five matches, and he hasn't looked back.  \n"", ""All of his runs have been made with a compact technique, designed to get behind the line of each ball. Observers say he gets into a tangle against the shorter ball often but his patience is key. On an A tour to Australia in 2009, he twice made five-hour 70s against an attack that included Doug Bollinger, Clint McKay and Jason Krejza. That series propelled him into senior team focus and a solid if not spectacular 2009-10 season, coupled with a move to look beyond Younis Khan - this didn't quite work out - and Mohammad Yousuf, brought about a richly-deserved Test debut in the middle order at Lord's against Australia. "", ""Azhar scored his first Test fifty in his second Test, in difficult batting conditions at Headingley, in a fourth-innings run-chase of 180 against Australia. His first Test hundred came only after he'd scored ten fifties, but that was only a minor blemish. Soon after that century against Sri Lanka came his landmark Test series, against England in the UAE in 2011-12, when he showed remarkable patience and temperament to score a second-innings century in another low-scoring match in Dubai.

His bowling - the reason he was first noticed - is characterised by a galloping approach, accuracy, and reverse-swing. But it is his batting that is more likely to win matches. He boasts a prodigious array of strokes and is particularly strong driving through cover and mid-off off both front and back foot. \nHe has two gears: block or blast. Cut off the big shots and Razzaq gets bogged down, although patience is his virtue as he demonstrated in a match-saving fifty against India in Mohali in 2005. Just prior to that he had also played a bewilderingly slow innings in Australia, scoring four runs in over two hours. When the occasion demands it though, as ODIs often do, he can still slog with the best of them: England were pillaged for a 22-ball 51 at the end of 2005. and then again for nearly 60 runs in the last three overs of an ODI in September the following year. \n', ""It has hardly been smooth sailing though through his career. He suffered a slump, particularly in his bowling, between 2002 and 2004 when, though his place in the team wasn't under threat, there was uncertainty over how best to use him. But there were signs he was rediscovering some of his old guile if not his pace and nip. And if the pitch is in anyway helpful to seam - as it was in his first and only Test five-wicket haul at Karachi in 2004 or against India at the same venue in January 2006 - he can be a proper danger. Though Kamran Akmal's hundred overshadowed all in the Karachi win over India, Razzaq's performance was easily his most emphatic as an allrounder: he scored 45 and 90 as well as taking seven wickets in the match. A combination of injuries and poor form put his Test place into question and a knee injury days before the 2007 World Cup meant Pakistan missed his presence in a disastrous campaign. "", 'A lackluster comeback to international cricket against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi and mediocre performance in the practice matches saw Razzaq being omitted from the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 World Championship and consequently announce his retirement from international cricket. He then went on to sign for Worcestershire towards the end of the county season as well as signing up with the Indian Cricket League, which ruled him out of Pakistan contention. He took back his decision to retire but committed himself to the ICL for two seasons, during which he served the Hyderabad Heroes as one of their star players. ', ""After a global amnesty and quitting the ICL, he was welcomed back to the Pakistan fold for the World Twenty20 in England and made an immediate impact as Pakistan won the tournament. His Test comeback also looked set to be complete after he was included in Pakistan's 15-man squad for the tour of Sri Lanka in June. Early in his career he promised to be Pakistan's most complete allrounder since Imran Khan, and though for a variety of reasons he hasn't translated that into achievement, his country wouldn't mind having just a very solid allrounder. \n"", ' June 2009']",[],46.0,77,9,1946.0,134,28.61,4741,41.04,3,7,230,23,15.0,0.0,265.0,228,57,5080.0,112,29.7,6252,81.25,3,23,382,124,35.0,0.0,32.0,29,10,393.0,46*,20.68,337,116.61,0,0,21,21,2.0,0.0,123.0,193,28,5371,203*,32.55,,,8,29,,,33.0,0.0,345.0,299,71,6851,112,30.04,,,3,38,,,51.0,0.0,142.0,126,31,2578,109,27.13,1967,131.06,1,9,222,107,19.0,0.0,46.0,76,7008,3694,100.0,5/35,7/155,36.94,3.16,70.0,4,1,0,265.0,254,10941,8564,269.0,6/35,6/35,31.83,4.69,40.6,8,3,0,32.0,22,339,395,20.0,3/13,3/13,19.75,6.99,16.9,0,0,0,123.0,,19206,11155,355,7/51,,31.42,3.48,54.1,,13,2,345.0,,14516,11689,385,6/35,6/35,30.36,4.83,37.7,13,4,0,142.0,128,2457,3133,135,4/13,4/13,23.20,7.65,18.2,2,0,0,True,True,False,True

He did it with style, too. Blessed with a fast bowler's temperament and fire, he surrounded his craft with mystique. Before the 1982 tour to England, captain Imran Khan asked him to grow a French beard to enhance the aura and it worked: England were his favourite victims through his career, responsible for his international breakthrough in 1977-78 as well as his finest hours, at the Oval in 1987 and the home series later that year (he took 30 wickets in three Tests, including the best bowling in an innings by a Pakistani, 9 for 56 in Lahore). Imran was to be a key influence on his career, one of the few capable of getting the best out of Qadir the man and bowler. \n"", ""Qadir's action was a wonderfully extravagant routine, and he admitted more than once that it was contrived as a spectacle to distract batsmen. Variety was the key; it was said he had six different deliveries per over. Like the Andy Roberts bouncer, Qadir was said to have two different googlies. The flipper was often equally lethal though much often depended not on his ability but on mood. "", ""Rarely was the mood right against India, whose batsmen were largely untroubled by him. On Pakistan's historic 1987 tour, when they won a series in India for the first time, Qadir was largely ineffective for four Tests before being dropped for the final. Iqbal Qasim and Tauseef Ahmed, orthodox spinners both, were far more effective and led Pakistan to victory. But for every India, there was a West Indies and that Pakistan were able to compete with the era's most frighteningly dominant team without losing a series to them in the mid-80s was largely down to Qadir's successes against them."", ""Qadir's appetite for the fight could not be questioned and it often came out in his batting. He played a few combative Test innings and some vital ODI ones, once taking 16 off Courtney Walsh's last over to win a World Cup tie. He faded away from the scene, however, in the early 90s with the emergence of Mushtaq Ahmed and played his last ODI in 1993. Since then he has run a private academy near Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore and his four sons have followed him into the game, with varying degrees of success, but his role in Mushtaq's rise and, to a lesser extent, that of Danish Kaneria should not be overlooked.

When all is not well, he looks so awkward you forget he can hit the ball clean and long. All has been well with Yuvraj more often in limited-overs cricket, where he can be effortless and brutal at the same time, than in Tests, though his form and consistency has been on the decline since his comeback following a recovery from a rare form of germ cell cancer in 2012. When he started off, though, his athleticism on the field and his canny left-arm spin made him a key one-day player as Indian cricket went through a makeover at the turn of the century. \n', 'Yuvraj\'s father, Yograj, who played one Test for India, was what Mike Agassi was to Andre. So obsessed was he with Yuvraj\'s cricket that he took a skating gold medal off his young son\'s neck and threw it out of the car. ""From now on, you are going to play cricket."" And from then on he has played cricket. The major shift came when, at 15, he carried kitbags in crowded local trains, living away from his parents and a luxurious life in Punjab. At 18 he was shredding a strong Australian attack, in only his second ODI, in the Champions Trophy in 2000.', ""Soon Yuvraj would become India's middle-order lynchpin, forming fruitful partnerships first with Rahul Dravid and then with MS Dhoni. Both batsmen, superb ODI operators in their own right, credited their success to Yuvraj's ability to score at will. Testament to Yuvraj's importance is that when he was dropped from the ODI side in 2010, it was the first such occurrence since he cemented his place in the Indian team. His ODI career is full of highlight reels, with the biggest impact being his contribution to India's World Cup triumph in 2011 - 362 runs, 15 wickets, and four Man-of-the-Match awards, and the Player of the Tournament. That put to shade even his awesome achievement in the World T20 triumph in 2007, where he famously hit a Stuart Broad over for six sixes."", ""However, his limitations have manifested themselves in Tests, where he has struggled both against the seaming and swinging ball, and quality spin. Apart from three shining innings - a sparkling century on a Lahore greentop, another from 61 for 4 against Pakistan, and an unbeaten 85 in a successful chase of 387 in Chennai - his Test career doesn't have much to write home about."", ""The World Cup win in 2011 was the biggest moment of his cricket career, but soon after that came the biggest challenge of his life, when he was diagnosed cancer which required a two-and-a-half month treatment in the USA. He returned home after completing his chemotherapy in April 2012, fairly confident that he could resume his duties on the cricket field reasonably quickly and in August he was named in India's squad for the World T20 in Sri Lanka."", 'In January 2013, poor form and fitness led to his ouster from the team. But a visibly slimmer and fitter Yuvraj emerged from a training stint in France in October and hit an unbeaten 35-ball 77 in a T20I against Australia on his comeback. But lack of consistency meant he was out of the ODI mix after the tour of South Africa in December 2013.', ""Even as his form dipped, Yuvraj continued to be a hot pick at the IPL auction, picking up contracts worth over a million dollars in 2014 ($2.33 million or Rs 14 crore to RCB), 2015 ($2.67 million or Rs 16 crore to Delhi Daredevils) and 2016 ($1.04 million or Rs 7 crore to Sunrisers Hyderabad). The hype surrounding him didn't transcend onto the cricket field, however, and the low point was a laboured 21-ball 11 in the final of the 2014 World T20 which resulted in India losing momentum and eventually the title to Sri Lanka. "", ""In January 2016, he made yet another international return, in Australia, for the T20 stretch leading into the World T20, where a twisted ankle curtailed his tournament. He hadn't had a great time at the World T20, his 52 runs coming at an average of 13.00 and a strike rate of exactly 100, and at 34, his international future seemed in doubt.

While he made waves in the domestic scene, Umesh really caught the eye during IPL 2010, where he impressed a much wider audience with his pace for Delhi Daredevils. He finally broke into the big league, when he was flown to the West Indies as a replacement for the injured Praveen Kumar during the World Twenty20 tournament in May 2010, and earned his first call-up to the India Test team for the tour of South Africa in November the same year. He made the Test playing XI for the first time against West Indies in Delhi in November 2011, and picked up nine wickets in his first two Tests, which in turn earned him a place for the Australia tour. ', 'On that tour, a disastrous one for India, Umesh was one of few positives for the side, outbowling his more experienced team-mates to finish with 14 wickets from four Tests and a strike rate of 50.50. More than his figures though, it was his speed and aggression that stood out. However, 2012 was an injury-prone year for him: he picked up a shin injury in Australia, before being ruled out one Test into the England series at the end of the year with back trouble.

Power was no surprise, but sublime touch was remarkable for a man of his bulk. He loathed exercise and often looked a passenger in the field, but with a willow between his palms he was suddenly galvanised. He played shots all round the wicket, was especially strong off his legs, and unleashed ferocious pulls and lofted drives. Imran Khan rated him the best batsman in the world against pace.  \n', ""\nEarly on he was vulnerable playing across his front pad or groping outside off stump. He used his feet well to the spinners, although this aggression has been his undoing. Inzi kept a cool head in a crisis and succeeded Javed Miandad as Pakistan's premier batsman, but his hapless running between wickets is legendary and most dangerous for his partners. "", ""\nThere were no such problems against New Zealand at a boiling Lahore in 2001-02, when Inzamam belted 329, the second-highest Test score by a Pakistani. However, he was then dogged by poor form, scoring just 16 runs in Pakistan's ill-fated World Cup campaign in 2003. He was dropped from the team briefly, but then roared back to form, scoring a magnificent unbeaten 138 and guiding Pakistan to a thrilling one-wicket win against Bangladesh at Multan. He was rewarded with the captaincy of the team, and despite leading them to victory in the Test series in New Zealand, question-marks about his leadership qualities surfaced when Pakistan were beaten in both the Test series and the one-dayers against India. "", ""\nThe selectors persevered with him and this bore results when he took a team thin on bowling resources to India and drew the Test series with a rousing performance in the final Test, Inzamam's 100th. After scoring a magnificent 184, Inzamam led the team astutely on a tense final day and took Pakistan to victory.  Since that day, Inzamam has gone from strength to strength as captain and premier batsman. By scoring a hundred against West Indies in June 2005, he kept up a remarkable record of match-winning centuries, among the best of modern-day batsmen. "", ""\nA magnificent year ended with Inzamam leading his team to triumph over Ashes-winning England; personally the series was arguably his best ever. He never failed to make a fifty, scored twin centuries at Faisalabad for the first time, going past Miandad as Pakistan's leading century-maker and joining him as only the second Pakistani with 8000 Test runs. "", '\nAs captain, he never looked more a leader, uniting a young, inexperienced team and turning them, once again, into a force to matter globally. The turn of the year brought contemplation; he missed the Test victory over India at Karachi with a persistent back injury. The subsequent ODI thrashing also raised concerns about Inzamam as ODI captain, none of which were entirely wiped away during ODI and Test wins in Sri Lanka. ', ""\nPakistan were then beaten comprehensively in the Test series in England though all was forgotten - including Inzamam's own poor form - by events at The Oval. There, Inzamam, astonishingly for a man perceived as so insouciant, became the most controversial figure in cricket for a week, leading his side off the field in protest at charges of ball tampering made by umpires Billy Doctrove and Darrell Hair. "", ""\nThey refused to come out at first, then delayed the start before eventually forfeiting the Test, the first time in the history of the game. In Pakistan, he became a national hero, saviour of a country's pride and honour. He was banned for four ODIs and  returned to lead the side to a series-win over West Indies followed by a disappointing  Test series in South Africa, and then quit the one-day game after Pakistan were eliminated from the World Cup at the first hurdle, an event overshadowed by the death of Bob Woolmer. Even though he expressed his desire to be part of the Test team, Inzamam was not offered a central contract in July and, according to a few, might signal the end of his illustrious international career. "", ""\nHe, however, made that decision himself after signing up for the Indian Cricket League and faced a life-time ban from PCB. He later quit the ICL and made himself available for selection. The second Test against South Africa in Lahore was his farewell game. He fell just two short of Javed Miandad's record for the highest Test aggregate by a Pakistan batsman and 60 short of a career average of 50."", ""\nInzamam's involvement in cricket following his retirement was limited. He took over as Afghanistan's head coach in October 2015. He began his tenure by helping Afghanistan win their first ODI and T20I series against a Full Member. They beat Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe, beat them again in the return series in the UAE, and also in the World T20 in 2016, which helped Afghanistan quality for the Super 10s.

Suave, erudite and monstrously talented, he gave cricket in the subcontinent real sex appeal in the 1970s and 1980s. As such he and TV completed the popularisation of the game in his country which Hanif Mohammad and the radio had begun. Thousands, if not millions, who had never dreamt of bowling fast on heartless baked mud suddenly wanted to emulate Imran and his lithe bounding run, his leap and his reverse-swinging yorker. He also made himself into an allrounder worth a place for his batting alone, and captained Pakistan as well as anyone, rounding off his career with the 1992 World Cup. He played hardly any domestic cricket in Pakistan: instead he just flew in for home series from Worcestershire or Sussex, or rather from the more fashionable London salons. His averages (37 with the bat, 22 with the ball) put him at the top of the quartet of allrounders (Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee and Kapil Dev being the others) who dominated Test cricket in the 1980s. And whereas Botham declined steadily, Imran just got better and better: in his last 10 years of international cricket he played 51 Tests, averaging a sensational 50 with the bat and 19 with the ball. He gave no quarter during some memorable battles with West Indies - Pakistan drew three series with them at a time when everybody else was being bounced out of sight - and he led Pakistan to their first series victory in England in 1987, taking 10 for 77 with an imperious display in the decisive victory at Headingley.

Farhat also evokes Saeed Anwar but only fleetingly; he bludgeons rather  than times his runs. He was rather too cavalier in his early appearances in the Test arena, and was promptly discarded after the tour to New Zealand in 2000-01. However, he tightened his game and achieved much more success in the 2003-04 season. Tempering his impressive array of shots with better defensive technique, Farhat scored a deluge of runs in the home series against South Africa and New Zealand, being involved in a record four successive hundred partnerships with Yasir Hameed in the one-day internationals against New Zealand. He also notched up his first century in both Tests and ODIs during this season, and then went on to score a vital 101 in Pakistan's victory against India in the Lahore Test. But since the India series, he has fallen away. A mediocre series at home to Sri Lanka and away to Australia saw him falter, especially with the emergence of the other left-handed opener, Salman Butt. When Pakistan included only one specialist opener in the squad for the series against England in 2005 - Butt - seemingly it confirmed that Farhat, temporarily, was out of national reckoning. But as an opener in Pakistan, you are never out of national reckoning and sure enough Farhat was back for the final Test against India, where he scored a fifty. That performance saw him on the plane to Sri Lanka and an average series. But with openers becoming as rare as dinosuars in Pakistan, he was retained for the summer tour to England, where he again produced some mixed results. Despite failures in the first two Tests, a broken finger and a spate of dropped catches, he came back to score a cavalier 91 in the final, fateful Oval Test. Runs against West Indies at home were followed by a barren patch in South Africa. A first away hundred followed by a patient half-century in the Napier Test of 2009 has set him up for a long sojourn in the Test side.

Iftikhar, however, is more Aaqib Javed than Wasim Akram or Waqar Younis, and his outswinger is considered by many to be as effective as Aaqib's. He can bowl reverse-swing - a prerequisite for Pakistani bowlers, when the ball gets a bit rougher, with good control over his yorkers. Iftikhar has performed consistently well in the domestic circuit since making his debut three years ago, taking over 200 wickets on the generally lifeless pitches of Pakistan. It was his stellar performances in the current domestic season that brought him to national attention. Iftikhar led his team - the Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited - to victory in the Patron's Trophy final against WAPDA, taking seven wickets in the first innings and ending with ten in the match. Not surprisingly, he was included in Pakistan's one-day squad for the series against India in 2004, before making his debut in the Paktel Cup seven moths later. He has since proved himself adept as a back-up bowler. But continuing injuries to Pakistan's frontline pacers means he remains perenially in the picture and he was rewarded with a Test debut against Sri Lanka in April 2006. Though he was expensive and wicketless, he would have been satisfied with a winning debut.

There was little doubt in the mind of Abdul Hafeez Kardar, Pakistan\'s first Test captain and influential administrator, when he first laid eyes on him as a youngster in the early 70s and famously predicted Miandad ""the find of the decade."" He wasn\'t wrong, as a stupendous debut series against New Zealand in 1976 started to prove. \n', 'Miandad was not of the classical school of batting, though he possessed a beautiful square cut and most shots in and outside the book: he was a fine early reverse-sweeper. But he worked the angles and spaces equally well; he knew above all how to score runs in almost any situation. These qualities presented themselves through his entire career and uniquely, not once did his career average fall below fifty. No Pakistani has scored more Test runs than him and, Inzamam-ul-Haq aside, probably no batsman has won as many matches for Pakistan.   ', 'There was often a touch of genie or genius about his finest innings, like his two hundreds in successive Tests in the West Indies in 1987-88 or the big double hundreds against India and England. Problems on the bouncy pitches of Australia or the swinging ones of England were overcome with time and, if people questioned his record against the West Indies, they never did after that 1987-88 series. ', ""He was versatile as well, as evidenced by a marvellous ODI career. Here his supreme running - it is said that he was one of the early pioneers of aggressive ODI running - shot placement and mental strength produced outstanding results. All qualities came together in a near-miraculous ODI century against India in Sharjah which won the Australasia Cup for Pakistan in 1986. He often saved his best for India, never more so than when he smote Chetan Sharma for a last-ball six to win that final. The match led to years of Pakistani domination over India, particularly in the deserts of Sharjah. In 1992, battling age and back problems, Miandad played a lead role in Pakistan's only World Cup triumph, with six half-centuries."", ""He was also Pakistan's youngest captain and always considered to be the most tactically astute. Imran Khan often acknowledges the role Miandad played as vice-captain with key on-field decisions, though the two were chalk to the other's cheese. But as captain possibly he was too abrasive to get on with all of his players, as at least two player revolts against his leadership suggest. And coinciding with the leadership of Imran, he never captained in as many Tests as he might have done. As with most subcontinent greats, he possibly lingered for longer than might have been advised, finally bowing out in 1996 after, ironically, a loss to India in the World Cup."", ""The problems of captaincy re-emerged when he became Pakistan's coach, where he had his ups and downs. Results were mostly positive but constant bickering from players about his excessively hands-on approach wasn't so good. After three stints in charge, he parted company with the team in 2004 to make way for Bob Woolmer after being blamed for Pakistan's one-day and Test losses to India.\nIn October 2008, Miandad declined an offer to become Pakistan's coach again, but he was soon appointed the PCB's director-general, possibly a role of even greater influence. The move was hailed by many Pakistanis but it didn't last long - Miandad quit the job in January 2009, after differences with the board over the exact scope of his role.\n""]",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1982'],124.0,189,21,8832.0,280*,52.57,,,23,43,,48,93.0,1.0,233.0,218,41,7381.0,119*,41.7,11014,67.01,8,50,,,71.0,2.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,402.0,632,95,28663,311,53.37,,,80,139,,,340.0,3.0,439.0,407,79,13973,152*,42.60,,,13,101,,,144.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,124.0,36,1470,682,17.0,3/74,5/94,40.11,2.78,86.4,0,0,0,233.0,12,436,297,7.0,2/22,2/22,42.42,4.08,62.2,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,402.0,,12688,6507,191,7/39,,34.06,3.07,66.4,,6,0,439.0,,830,613,18,3/20,3/20,34.05,4.43,46.1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Most often, he is used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the 26-year-old from Peshawar has qualities of his own that suggest he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often.  \n', ""A limited batsman but a technically sound keeper, Rizwan made his international debut shortly after the 2015 World Cup when the slot behind the stumps was still up for grabs. He made a bright start against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, averaging nearly 60 with the bat in his first eight innings, but against more challenging opposition, his deficiencies were quickly exposed. A lengthy lean patch followed, and once he lost his place to Sarfaraz for the World T20 in 2016, there was little doubt who Pakistan's No. 1 wicketkeeper was. After the debacle at the World T20, Sarfaraz was appointed captain of the limited-overs sides, and consequently Rizwan's game time diminished further, coming to a complete halt until Sarfaaraz sat out the last five games on the tour to South Africa earlier this year serving a ban.

He doesn't, however, seem to have the shots necessary to make him a valuable asset in T20Is, but with that being Sarfaraz's strongest suit, both as a batsman and captain, it would have been hard to dislodge him in the format at any rate. "", ""Having made his debut over a decade ago on Pakistan's domestic circuit, Rizwan has been an ever-present participant in the Quaid-e-Azam trophy, plying his trade with the hugely successful SNGPL side, helping his side to three titles in the last four years.

He doesn't flight his offbreaks much, but his excellent control over line and length allows the captain to use him at almost any stage of an innings. He is also one of the better fielders in the Pakistan team, especially in the point region."", 'Despite these skills, Hafeez failed to create a regular place for himself in the Pakistan in his first seven years in international cricket, primarily due to his inability to convert his starts into substantial scores. He scored plenty of pretty 30s and 40s, laced with some exquisite cover-drives, but that only helped cement the opinion that Hafeez may forever remain a player whose potential exceeds performance.', ""To a large extent, that changed in 2011, as Hafeez put in consistent displays with both bat and ball in all forms of the game. It actually started in the series against South Africa in November 2010, and then continued through 2011, a year which fetched him two centuries in Tests and three in ODIs, apart from two fifties in Twenty20 internationals. He won an incredible ten Man-of-the-Match awards in international cricket that year, and became only the third cricketer - after Sanath Jayasuriya and Jacques Kallis - to score 1000-plus runs and take 30 or more wickets in ODIs in a calendar year. With Taufeeq Umar, he formed Pakistan's most stable opening combination in Tests, as his aggression at the top of the order became a perfect counterfoil to Taufeeq's defensive approach. "", ""Since then, Hafeez has continued to frustrate and amaze, and the frequency with which he can switch from one mode to the other is a large part of his enigma. By many metrics, he's one of Pakistan's most prolific cricketers, but arguably also one of the more profligate ones in the way he's handled his immense talent. "", ""The elegance of the full face of his bat, particularly when driving through the off side, means any runs he scores are more memorable than they otherwise might be - and there have been plenty of them; he's number 10 on the all time ODI runs list for Pakistan. There was a century against India in Dhaka that preceded a disappointing barren spell, and then a purple patch against Sri Lanka where he smashed three hundreds in four games in 2013. A swashbuckling unbeaten 57 against India in the Champions Trophy final may ultimately be his most famous innings, as it powered Pakistan to a total they wouldn't let India get close to. "", 'It is his usefulness with the ball, though, that has kept him lingering around the Pakistan setup for so long. His consistency gives his side another option, which explains the reluctance to drop him even when his stock skill - batting - is letting him down. He has opened the bowling for Pakistan on several occasions - particularly in T20 cricket - and briefly took on the mantle of lead spinner after Saeed Ajmal was banned for an illegal action. ', 'That curse, however, has plagued Hafeez throughout his career too, and he has found himself suspended for an illegal bowling action no less than three times. Tellingly, it is in those periods that his place in the side has been in the greatest peril, as his technical flaws as a batsman appear destined to go largely unremedied. He was ignored for a recent series in Zimbabwe, but for a player with 50 Tests, 200 ODIs, a shade under 100 T20Is, and countless comebacks, one would have to be particularly brave to be writing his eulogy just yet.

Over 2007 and 2008, he also emerged, still improbably young, as a hot pace prospect. Even before he went to England on an U-19 tour, he had been picked out as a special talent by Akram himself at a pace camp he oversaw in Lahore in May 2007. By 2010, he had become the hottest pace bowling prospect around the world - but within months his career was in ruins following charges of spot-fixing.  \n', 'He began in 2009 with an impressive showing on the domestic circuit, impressing with his whippy pace and swing. He took 55 wickets for National Bank of Pakistan in his debut season, and earned selection to the Pakistan World T20 squad. There he hit the big time, taking over from an out-of-sorts Sohail Tanvir and bowling with pace, accuracy and courage. ', ""He hovered in the high 80mphs, touching even 90 on occasion and was a crucial opening link in Pakistan's title run. He bowled several nerveless final overs and one absolutely crucial opening over, in the final, when he dismissed tournament top-scorer Tillakaratne Dilshan for a five-ball duck, peppering him with quick, short balls. He carried his form over to the ODI version, picking up match-winning figures of 4 for 28 against Sri Lanka in August before turning in consistent spells in the Champions Trophy. "", 'He picked six wickets on Test debut in Sri Lanka. Thereafter, over tours to New Zealand, Australia and England, he matured remarkably, building up his pace and both new-ball and reverse swing. The 2010 tour of England saw the best of him and he became the youngest bowler, at 18, to take 50 Test wickets. But his world crashed around him when he was implicated in a spot-fixing scam in which it was alleged that he had bowled deliberate, pre-planned no-balls in a Test. In February 2011 he was handed a five-year ban following investigations by an ICC tribunal. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to six months in prison at Southwark Crown Court.', ""After his release, Amir frequently expressed his contrition over the incident and co-operated with the ICC in spreading its anti-corruption message. Having been cleared to return to all forms of cricket in September 2015, he made his international comeback the following January, as part of Pakistan's limited-overs squad to New Zealand. On his next international assignment, the 20-over Asia Cup in Dhaka, he made waves once again, rattling India's top order with three wickets in a hostile spell of pace bowling. Amir's reintegration came full circle when he was selected in the Test squad for England later that year, setting up a comeback Test at Lord's, the venue where the spot-fixing scandal had derailed his career six years before."", 'However, it is in Test cricket, the format supposedly perfectly designed for him to express his wizardry, that he has disappointed most profoundly. Magical spells with the new ball have been all too fleeting, and his performances in the three countries where conditions are arguably best suited to him, have been largely indifferent. With the ball, he averaged 42.41 in England in 2016, 28.83 in New Zealand that same year, and 61.60 when Australia whitewashed Pakistan at the turn of the year. The prodigious banana swing from that titillating left-arm angle - and that quite beautiful bowling action - does come, but not nearly as potently or regularly as memory suggests it did in his teenage years. In other words, Amir, in Test cricket, has flattered to deceive. ', ""It depends on what he wants to be remembered for, though, because if he wishes to live for famous moments rather than a stellar career, he's got the biggest one tucked up already. In the Champions Trophy final against India, it was his opening salvo that put the game out of India's reach. Defending 338, he trapped Rohit Sharma in front in the first over, before taking Virat Kohli's outside edge twice in two balls - the first was dropped in the slips. Shikhar Dhawan fell at Amir's hands too, with the fast bowler's figures reading 6-2-16-3, as Pakistan stormed to victory by 180 runs. \n"", '\n']",[],36.0,67,11,751.0,48,13.41,1980,37.92,0,0,91,3,5.0,0.0,50.0,27,9,352.0,73*,19.55,430,81.86,0,2,31,8,6.0,0.0,42.0,11,4,44.0,21*,6.28,58,75.86,0,0,1,2,4.0,0.0,66.0,100,15,1334,66,15.69,3007,44.36,0,2,164,12,15.0,0.0,72.0,35,15,402,73*,20.10,500,80.40,0,2,36,8,11.0,0.0,122.0,45,20,180,21*,7.20,196,91.83,0,0,10,6,11.0,0.0,36.0,67,7619,3627,119.0,6/44,7/64,30.47,2.85,64.0,6,4,0,50.0,50,2473,1971,60.0,4/28,4/28,32.85,4.78,41.2,1,0,0,42.0,42,936,1066,55.0,4/13,4/13,19.38,6.83,17.0,1,0,0,66.0,119,12214,5786,254,7/61,10/72,22.77,2.84,48.0,10,13,2,72.0,72,3650,2805,101,5/36,5/36,27.77,4.61,36.1,1,1,0,122.0,120,2688,3025,147,4/13,4/13,20.57,6.75,18.2,3,0,0,False,False,False,False

It shows in his batting, which reached unprecedented levels of consistency in 2011, and in his captaincy, which helped lift Pakistan from the depths of the spot-fixing saga in England in 2010. Taking over as leader immediately after that episode at the age of 36, Misbah's calm approach was exactly what Pakistan cricket needed after the tumultuous period it had gone through. \n"", ""As a batsman, Misbah can either defend dourly with unflagging patience, or irritate bowlers with his improvisations. It helps that his defensive technique is sound: that solid foundation has helped him bat for long periods in Test cricket. That aspect of his game was in evidence right from his first Test innings in 2001, when he survived over two hours to score 28 in Auckland. He should have played much more international cricket thereafter, but was held back by his inconsistency. For four years between 2003 and 2007, he didn't play a single Test, and only turned up for a handful of ODIs."", ""However, a run-filled domestic season, followed by club cricket in England and Inzamam's retirement from ODIs, prompted the board to award Misbah a central contract in July 2007. A month later, he was surprisingly picked, ahead of Mohammad Yousuf, for the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa. He repaid the selectors' faith by finishing the tournament as Pakistan's best player and nearly taking them to victory in the final. He continued the good run on the tour to India later that year, scoring two hundreds, each of which spanned more than 400 minutes. "", 'However, it was in 2011 that Misbah truly rose above the crowd and established his credentials as a top-class batsman ', "" a leader of men. He was in charge when Pakistan completed one of their greatest Test series wins - a 3-0 sweep over the then No. 1 side, England in early 2012.

He made his international debut in early 2008, in the home ODI series against Zimbabwe, and though he did reasonably well in his early games, he was dropped in 2009 and spent two-and-a-half years away from international cricket. He returned with his appetite suitably whetted, and 2012 was a particularly memorable year for him, as he scored two ODI hundreds against India, and followed up with one more early the next year to firmly establish himself at the top of the order. An aggressive batsman, Jamshed plays strokes all round the wicket, but also backs it up with sound temperament and an ability to convert starts into big scores. \n', ""Jamshed's talent was visible from his junior days, and he made a mark very early in his cricketing career. Following an impressive 74 for National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) on his first-class debut when aged only 15, Nasir Jamshed was selected for the Pakistan Under-19s side to play the visiting Sri Lankans. Scoring a 44 and a 204 on his debut, he helped his side draw that match after Pakistan had conceded a 253-run first-innings lead. Although he failed to replicate those performances for the remainder of the season, he remained part of the NBP squad as well as representing Lahore. Jamshed was also part of the Pakistan U-19 squad that successfully defended its title in 2006, beating India by 38 runs."", ""Jamshed's break, however, came in the 2007-08 season where he scored 800 runs in ten Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches with the help of three centuries and was selected to play for the Patron's XI side that took on the touring Zimbabweans. A 182 off only 240 deliveries was enough for his name to be shortlisted for the 15-probables for the ODI series. He didn't immediately make a huge impact in international cricket, but in 2012 he showed that all the talk about his early promise wasn't misplaced.""]",[],2.0,4,0,51.0,46,12.75,107,47.66,0,0,8,0,1.0,0.0,48.0,48,3,1418.0,112,31.51,1881,75.38,3,8,150,19,13.0,0.0,18.0,18,1,363.0,56,21.35,320,113.43,0,2,34,12,6.0,0.0,98.0,166,9,5831,182,37.14,,,15,28,,,97,0,146.0,145,7,4480,158,32.46,5307,84.41,9,21,,,50.0,0.0,111.0,108,9,2431,104*,24.55,1981,122.71,1,13,273,55,36,0,2.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,48.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,18.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,98.0,,12,8,0,-,-,-,4.00,-,0,0,0,146.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,111.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

His ability to hit the ball while batting lower down the order made him a useful allrounder and he was the third Pakistani to take 100 Test wickets and score 1000 Test runs. He possessed a good action and the ability to seam the bowl with equal effectiveness both ways. On March 15, 1979 at Melbourne, he bowled a memorable\nspell to take nine wickets in an innings. He dismissed seven batsmen while\nconceding one run from 33 balls. He was a highly controversial player due to\nhis idiosyncracies and mood swings and bowled a succession of bouncers at other\nfast bowlers such as Jeff Thompson and Joel Garner. Once, protesting about his\npay, he flew to England during a Test series between the two teams in\nPakistan. He was also involved in the Hildrich affair during the Australian\ntour of 1979.

Instead, he became the first Pakistan captain since the great Imran Khan to win a 50-over world title.  \n"", 'Sarfraz took over the ODI reins in February 2017, providing his side with rare single-minded direction and focus. In June that year, Pakistan went into the Champions Trophy as the lowest-ranked team and lost heavily against India to start off, but then went on a red-hot run to beat South Africa, Sri Lanka and hosts England, and finally India to claim the prize. ', ""A right-hand middle-order batsman, Sarfraz wasn't always the sprightly presence that bossed the Sharjah Test of 2014 - when Pakistan chased 302 in 57.3 overs to level the series. In fact, between 2007 - when he made his debut - and 2014, Sarfraz had played just four Tests, four T20Is and 26 ODIs. He was miles off being a regular in any of Pakistan's sides, and not nearly good enough to warrant a place as a specialist batsman; he hadn't scored an international half-century in all this time. It was an era when the Akmals - no less than three of them - had taken out a lease on the area behind the stumps. "", ""Sarfraz had appeared on Pakistan's radar initially by leading Pakistan's Under-19s to the World Cup title in 2006, scoring half-centuries in his third and fourth match. He broke into domestic cricket, where 523 runs in 10 matches along with 28 dismissals behind the stumps pushed him into the A team's tour of Australia in 2007. Then he was left in the wilderness. "", ""It took seven long years for the spotlight to return to Sarfraz, when he made 74 in Pakistan's total of 359 in the second innings against Sri Lanka in Dubai. The innings was in a losing cause, but it did establish him as the team's first-choice wicketkeeper. He averaged 71.20 over the next 18 months, and during this period also elbowed his way into the ODI side midway through the 2015 World Cup campaign with a run-a-ball 49 against South Africa. "", ""Since then, Sarfraz has been a man for all formats, steady with the gloves, aggressive with the bat and street-smart as a captain across formats. At 30, with the Champions Trophy tucked under his arm, he became arguably Pakistan's most respected cricketer since Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan."", ' ']",[],49.0,86,13,2657.0,112,36.39,3743,70.98,3,18,268,8,146.0,21.0,101.0,76,17,1942.0,105,32.91,2253,86.19,2,9,148,10,98.0,23.0,54.0,38,12,745.0,89*,28.65,579,128.67,0,3,74,14,32.0,10.0,149.0,235,43,7623,213*,39.70,,,10,54,,,471,49,179.0,140,33,3405,105,31.82,,,3,17,,,197.0,45.0,179.0,133,42,2561,89*,28.14,1996,128.30,0,10,245,50,89,42,49.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,101.0,1,12,15,0.0,-,-,32.91,7.50,-,0,0,0,54.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,149.0,1,4,5,0,-,-,-,7.50,-,0,0,0,179.0,1,12,15,0,-,-,-,7.50,-,0,0,0,179.0,1,4,6,0,-,-,-,9.00,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Saqlain Mushtaq was perhaps the first offspinner to master the doosra, a\ndelivery that spins away from the batsman even though it is delivered\nwith an offspinner's action. Saqlain has a fast, short-stepping action with a halting delivery, and has a propensity to bowl no-balls, unusually for a bowler with such a short run. He is criticised for attempting too much variation and he often throws in the doosra the first time a batsman faces. Saqlain's international career got off to a splendid start - he was the fastest bowler to 100 one-day wickets, and his phenomenal control meant that he regularly bowled at the death. But his finest moment arguably came in a Test match, at Chennai in 1998-99, when his ten-for allowed Pakistan to sneak nerve-tingling 12-run win against India. However, his stock has fallen a long way since then, with Shoaib Malik, a better batsman than Saqlain, usurping the spinner's spot in the ODI line-up and Danish Kaneria becoming the frontline Test spinner. Saqlain did get an opportunity to have a go at the Indians again in the 2003-04 series, but unflattering figures of 1 for 204 at Multan meant that he was quickly consigned to the scrap heap. He was unable to force his way back ahead of Danish Kaneria and he was blighted by injury after a prolific time with Surrey. However, his career was given a lifeline in 2007 when he joined Mushtaq Ahmed at Sussex and there was even talk of him qualifying for England. That could remain a distant dream, after signing a contract with the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League.

He didn't mind pulling either and off his toes, he was efficient rather than whippy as Anwar was. Further, like Anwar, Butt's footwork didn't really hold him back. But in attitude and temperament Butt was more Anwar's long-time partner, Aamir Sohail.

His breakthrough period was the winter of 2004, where he first scored an ODI century against India at Eden Gardens and then went further by scoring a fifty and a maiden Test century in Sydney later in the year. For most of 2005, he failed to build on that and despite another ODI century, also against India, doubts about his defensive technique and overt dash crept in, resulting in him dropping in and out of the team. But against England to end the year, he responded to criticism by unveiling a startling restraint and change of tempo, hitting a century and two fifties in the Tests, each innings commendably restrained. Though his consistency isn't up to the mark, he still remains a vital member of the Test team. Following the disastrous tour of Australia in 2009-10, where senior players were slapped with serious punishments by the PCB, Butt came through unharmed and was given the vice- captaincy for the Asia Cup and England tour in 2010."", ""He had made impressive strides at age-level matches before making his Test debut against Bangladesh in 2003-04, playing in the Under-19 World Cup and touring South Africa with Pakistan's Academy team, smashing 233 against the South African Academy side.

But after winning much praise for his leadership on and off the field - and leading Pakistan to Test wins against Australia and England - his career was rocked by charges of involvement in spot-fixing and, in February 2011, he was handed a ten-year ban (with five years suspended) by the ICC.

He announced his retirement in the middle of Pakistan\'s 1994-95 tour of Zimbabwe, following some fishy goings-on in South Africa under Salim Malik\'s captaincy, then returned as ""Mr Clean"" to captain the side after he had given plenty of evidence to Judge Qayyum\'s inquiry. All went well at first in South Africa in 1997-98 until he found, like Rameez Raja and Aamir Sohail, that certain senior players did not want things to change. He made a surprise return to the colours for the 2001 tour of England, and got a second shot at the captaincy when Waqar Younis was sacked after Pakistan\'s miserable performance at the 2003 World Cup. There was more controversy to follow, though. He kept up his crusade to clean up the game, writing an open letter to the ICC, warning of the dangers of ""fancy fixing"". Then, he was suspended for five matches for wrongly claiming a catch during the series against Bangladesh. These incidents led to the souring of relations between him and the Pakistan board, and ultimately resulted in his stepping down from captaincy at the end of that series.  \n', ""Latif's penchant for controversy continued after his retirement too.

In 2011 he was the leading wicket-taker in Tests, with 50 in eight matches. But the best series of his young career came early in 2012, when he destroyed the batting line-up of the best team in the world, England, taking 24 wickets in just three games at 14.70. In the process, he clearly won the battle of offspinners against the highly rated Graeme Swann. ', "" However, Ajmal first made his mark in international cricket in ODIs. He was called up for the 2008 Asia Cup, and soon after he had the Australians completely bewildered in the ODI series in the UAE; he gave away few runs and his doosra was almost unreadable. The ICC called him for his action, though it was cleared soon after. The pressure didn't get to him and immediately after, he played a crucial role in Pakistan's drive to the 2009 World Twenty20 title, regularly bottling up the middle overs with Shahid Afridi.

On a lifeless pitch, he was a master of the percentage game, his caution a useful counterpoint to the risks taken by Sanath Jayasuriya, his opening partner almost throughout his Test career. All his big Test innings - he scored six double-hundreds in his career, a feat bettered only by Don Bradman (12), Wally Hammond and Brian Lara (seven each) - were been slow affairs but the most tortuous episode of his international career was its start: it took him nearly seven years to get established. However, since the 1990s his average climbed upwards. An elegant player to watch, Atapattu's signature shot was his high-elbow cover-drive. \n"", ""For three years he stood as Jayasuriya's understudy before being appointed to lead the one-day side in April 2003. He had been expected to take charge of the Test team as well, but the selection committee appointed Hashan Tillakaratne for that job. Atapattu's career took another bizarre twist later in the year when embroiled in the cash-in-the-bedroom affair in which a match-fixing investigation was initiated after a large sum of cash was discovered in the safe of the hotel room he had occupied during England's tour in 2003. The ICC later cleared Atapattu of any wrongdoing and the likeliest explanation for the mystery remains a crude attempt to blacken his reputation."", ""But by early 2004 the team was drifting downwards under Tillakaratne and the selectors were finally compelled to appoint Atapattu as the Test captain. Within weeks he had halted the team's slide and established himself as a strong leader. On the surface a quiet and reserved character, his captaincy pedigree was not entirely obvious to the outsider, but within the dressing-room he was a straight-talking and positive captain, firm and fair in his dealings with the players and aggressive in his approach to the game. By mid-2004 the fortunes of the team had changed as Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup and whitewashed South Africa. The team fared poorly in the ICC Champions Trophy but perked up against Pakistan in October 2004."", ""But Atapattu's capacity for attracting the unexpected continued when, out of the blue, Ashantha de Mel, the new government-appointed chairman of selectors, launched a scathing attack on the team management on the eve of the Paktel Cup in 2004-05, accusing them of blocking his attempts to blood new players. Atapattu wisely steered clear of a public confrontation, though his relationship with the selectors remained prickly. "", 'His career was put on hold by a back injury early in 2006 which led to Mahela Jayawardene taking on the captaincy. He was slowly reintroduced to the one-day side, but his tussles with the selectors continued. He was a late inclusion on the Australian tour following a ministerial intervention to bring him into the squad, but midway through the series he hit out at the selectors again, calling them ""a set of muppets headed by a joker"". He scored two half-centuries in the series, including 80 in the second innings in Hobart, but announced his retirement from international cricket on the last day of the Test.   ', 'Atapattu then joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League, playing for the Delhi Giants and ICL World XI. A ban on he and four other Sri Lankans was lifted in September 2008, meaning Atapattu was free to play domestic cricket back home.', ""Since retirement from all cricket, Atapattu has forged a reputation as a technically adroit and hard-working batting coach, particularly for his work with the Sri Lanka team. He has been the national side's batting coach since 2011, and was promoted to the position of assistant coach in March 2013. In the wake of Paul Farbrace's sudden departure from the head coach position a year later, Atapattu was appointed the interim head coach for the away tour of England, and the home tour against South Africa, in July."", '\n', ' September 2008\n']",[],90.0,156,15,5502.0,249,39.02,,,16,17,685,4,58.0,0.0,268.0,259,32,8529.0,132*,37.57,12594,67.72,11,59,734,15,70.0,0.0,2.0,1,0,5.0,5,5.00,8,62.5,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,228.0,348,49,14591,253*,48.79,,,47,53,,,149,0,329.0,319,45,10802,132*,39.42,,,18,71,,,91.0,0.0,3.0,1,0,5,5,5.00,8,62.50,0,0,0,0,1,0,90.0,5,48,24,1.0,1/9,1/9,24.0,3.00,48.0,0,0,0,268.0,2,51,41,0.0,-,-,32.91,4.82,-,0,0,0,2.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,228.0,,1302,692,19,3/19,,36.42,3.18,68.5,,0,0,329.0,,81,64,1,1/12,1/12,64.00,4.74,81.0,0,0,0,3.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

When a loss of form and confidence from Jayasuriya gave Arnold another chance at the top of the order in 2002, he scored 62 and 109 in a valiant rearguard at Old Trafford. Failure in the series that followed left him on the sidelines for long periods after the 2003 World Cup but Arnold made his way back into the team for the home series against Australia. Despite making 51 not out in his last ODI against Zimbabwe, Arnold was dropped from the ODI and Test teams in July 2004. The seven-man Ashantha de Mel selection committee wanted to blood new talent and Arnold's future looked bleak for a while. But he worked hard on his game in the nets and started to score heavily in domestic cricket. Finally, with his replacements failing to impress, he won a recall for the New Zealand tour in December 2004.  However, pressure from the young brigade - the likes of Tillakaratne Dilshan - left him fighting for his place.

A Test average of over 50, a triple-hundred, a famous double-hundred against India in India, and a brilliant rearguard partnership to clinch Pakistan's 3-0 Test whitewash over England, leave no doubt about his quality and class. He is also one of the most successful fielders for Pakistan, and can bowl respectable slow-medium. As a captain, Younis has enjoyed success in leading Pakistan to the world Twenty20 title in 2009.\n \nMuch of his persona evokes the idea of the quintessential Pathan warrior - committed, inspired, capable, and bearing the burden of conflict with fortitude and poise. Born in Mardan, a prominent city in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Younis moved at an early age to Karachi, where he caught the eye of Rashid Latif and Saeed Anwar at Malir Gymkhana, one of the city's renowned sports clubs. The relationship with Latif blossomed into a nurturing mentorship, guiding Younis towards entry onto the world stage. After two impressive domestic seasons, he got a Test call-up, and marked it with a century on debut.\n \nStyle and aesthetics are not his strongest points. His technique relies on a good deal of bottom hand, which deprives it of the fluidity and grace that is typical of Asia's best batsmen. Yet when Younis gets going, he produces results in the face of steep odds.\n \nIndeed, the steeper the odds, the more Younis seems to thrive. His match-winning 267 and 84 not out in Bangalore came after a string of low scores prompted a sarcastic comment from the team manager that leaked into the media. His greatest captaincy feat - the world Twenty20 championship in England - was achieved weeks after Pakistan cricket had been devastated by the terror attacks in Lahore. And though his triple-century came at home on a flat track, the innings began under pressure when Younis, eschewing the nightwatchman, stepped out himself in the dying moments of the second day with Pakistan staring at a huge Sri Lankan total. Unsurprisingly for a rearguard specialist, Younis has emerged a master of the fourth innings. Among players with 1000 or more fourth-innings Test runs, his average is among the highest.\n \nAlong with these accomplishments, Younis's career has also seen turmoil. Inability to control infighting within the team and display tact with the PCB led to him losing the captaincy in late 2009, and he effected a moody refusal when circumstances changed and it was offered again. His nature is to be inward-looking and intensely focused, quietly fighting his way through. While this makes for a reclusive personality that shuns the media and runs afoul of officialdom, it has also been the source of Younis's batting strength and his extraordinary resilience as a cricketer."", ' \n']",[],118.0,213,19,10099.0,313,52.05,19375,52.12,34,33,1082,70,139.0,0.0,265.0,255,23,7249.0,144,31.24,9628,75.29,7,48,578,56,135.0,0.0,25.0,23,3,442.0,51,22.10,364,121.42,0,2,31,12,12.0,0.0,229.0,385,42,17116,313,49.90,,,56,64,,,243,0,351.0,331,36,9911,144,33.59,,,12,64,,,196.0,0.0,83.0,78,17,1864,71*,30.55,1589,117.30,0,10,144,37,34,0,118.0,31,804,491,9.0,2/23,4/50,54.55,3.66,89.3,0,0,0,265.0,20,284,288,3.0,1/3,1/3,96.0,6.08,94.6,0,0,0,25.0,1,22,18,3.0,3/18,3/18,6.00,4.9,7.3,0,0,0,229.0,,3620,2120,44,4/52,,48.18,3.51,82.2,,0,0,351.0,,1169,1127,28,3/5,3/5,40.25,5.78,41.7,0,0,0,83.0,7,104,136,6,3/18,3/18,22.66,7.84,17.3,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Frail of build, Yasir's game is built on timing and an easy elegance. A technique more solid than many recent top-order Pakistani batsmen served him well in his career early on. His exploits in the one-day arena were initially as impressive, and he forged a superb combination with Imran Farhat at the top of the order: against New Zealand at home the pair put together a record four consecutive hundred partnerships. The early signs were promising then, but he developed a worrying tendency to waste his starts, making pretty 20s and then throwing it away, often by flailing at wide ones outside off. That saw him lose his place in the team in late 2004. Selectorial inconsistencies didn't help, Hameed being dropped the next match after scoring two fifties in a Test at Syndey. Thereafter opportunities have been limited: a few ODIs here and there (in all of which he has made contributions) and no Tests since June 2005. Persistence at domestic level paid off, however, as he returned to the national squad against the West Indies in November 2006, made a couple of fifties in the ODI series and booked himself a seat to South Africa at the start of 2007. With Mohammad Yousuf missing there, opportunities will be present.

He is technically sound, but, much like Virender Sehwag, he uses the defensive option only as a last resort, after all the attacking alternatives have been explored. He loves to make room and thrash the ball through the off side, but the stroke that bears his signature more than any other is the one he developed for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 - the eponymously named ""Dilscoop"" shot over his head, which confounded bowlers and experts alike. \n', 'In fact, 2009 was a watershed year in his career, and a huge factor was his move up the batting order to open the innings in all three forms of the game. It was a move that proved his making, as he exploited attacking fields and amassed huge scores in all formats: he scored 11 international hundreds in the year, and won the World Twenty20 Player of the Series prize.', ""Dilshan's abundant talent was never in doubt from the moment he made his debut, but he went through several early troughs, most notably when he was dropped from 2001 to 2003. Having burst onto the international scene with an unbeaten 163 against Zimbabwe in his first series in November 1999, Dilshan's career remained largely unfulfilled until he cemented his place as one of the most destructive openers in the modern era. Add his electric fielding, especially at backward point, and his underrated offspin, and Dilshan is a quality package. In 2011 he was named Sri Lanka's captain, after the resignation of Kumar Sangakkara, but his reign lasted less than a year, with Mahela Jayawardene replacing him after Sri Lanka's tour to South Africa in 2011-12. Like his team, Dilshan had had a poor run of form while he was captain, but his batting enjoyed a revival after being relieved of leadership, particularly in ODI cricket, where he was 2012's second-heaviest scorer, with 1119 runs. \n"", ' ']",['ICC Twenty20 International Performance of the Year 2009'],87.0,145,11,5492.0,193,40.98,8379,65.54,16,23,677,24,88.0,0.0,330.0,303,41,10290.0,161*,39.27,11933,86.23,22,47,1111,55,123.0,1.0,80.0,79,12,1889.0,104*,28.19,1567,120.54,1,13,223,33,31.0,2.0,233.0,384,24,13979,200*,38.83,,,38,59,,,356,23,449.0,416,54,14314,188,39.54,,,30,71,,,204.0,8.0,221.0,217,25,5193,104*,27.04,4228,122.82,1,34,633,110,79,3,87.0,76,3385,1711,39.0,4/10,4/10,43.87,3.03,86.7,1,0,0,330.0,204,5880,4778,106.0,4/4,4/4,45.07,4.87,55.4,3,0,0,80.0,25,258,313,9.0,2/4,2/4,34.77,7.27,28.6,0,0,0,233.0,,6501,3255,90,5/49,,36.16,3.00,72.2,,1,0,449.0,,7871,6303,152,4/4,4/4,41.46,4.80,51.7,4,0,0,221.0,116,1564,1892,64,3/16,3/16,29.56,7.25,24.4,0,0,0,False,True,False,True

With his flighted legbreaks and well disguised wrong 'uns, de Silva was a consistent wicket-taker throughout the 70s. In Sri Lanka's inaugural Test he captured 3 for 54 and 0 for 38, his first Test wicket being that of David Gower caught at the wicket by Mahes Goonatilleke. de Silva distinguished himself on the following tour to Pakistan, taking seventeen wickets in three Tests, including the first five-wicket haul by a Sri Lankan when he took 5 for 59 at Faisalabad.

A technically sound batsman with strokes all around the wicket, Chandimal also stands out because of the maturity he shows at the crease and his temperament to build and pace an innings. \n', ""He made his international debut when only 21, and impressed almost immediately, scoring 111 in his second ODI, against India in the 2010 triangular series in Zimbabwe. Four innings later, he made another century, this time against England at Lord's, but his stocks rose significantly in 2012, when he performed superbly in ODIs on successive tours to South Africa and Australia. In conditions he wouldn't have been used to, Chandimal occupied the crucial No.4 slot and revelled in the responsibility, scoring consistently. In 16 ODI innings in those two series, he aggregated 630 runs, including six fifties. He was equally impressive on his Test debut too, scoring fifties in each innings in Durban as Sri Lanka won their first Test in South Africa. "", ""A dip in his limited overs form, especially at home, saw Chandimal dropped from the side during the latter half of 2012, though he remained in the Sri Lanka squad for all three formats. He returned to the Test side at the SCG for the New Year Test, and hit an unbeaten 67, batting alongside the tail. Six weeks later he became Sri Lanka's youngest ever captain, at 23, when he was handed the reins of Sri Lanka's top-ranked Twenty20, and was also named Angelo Mathews' deputy in Tests and ODIs. He celebrated his elevation with back-to-back Test hundreds against Bangladesh at home. "", ""Chandimal's rise to the national team came after consistent performances with bat and gloves at age-level cricket. That included an attacking century against India Under-19s in August 2007 and an unbeaten 112 in the tri-nation series against England U-19s the following year earned him a call-up to the squad for the U-19 World Cup in Malaysia in 2008."", ""Shortly after completing a prolific season for Colombo's Ananda College, Chandimal was invited to join Nondescripts Cricket Club by Kumar Sangakkara. Chandimal was only 19 when scored his maiden first-class century against New Zealand in 2009, representing a Sri Lanka Cricket Development XI in two three-day practice matches against the likes of Chris Martin, Darryl Tuffey, Ian O'Brien, Jacob Oram and Daniel Vettori. He was among the leading run-getters in Sri Lanka's Interprovincial Twenty20 competition, and won a call-up to the national side for the ICC World Twenty20 in 2010. Soon after, the international opportunities followed, and Chandimal has made the most of them."", '\n']",[],53.0,97,7,3768.0,164,41.86,7667,49.14,11,17,401,22,76.0,10.0,146.0,132,21,3599.0,111,32.42,4855,74.12,4,22,245,39,59.0,7.0,54.0,47,4,800.0,58,18.60,766,104.43,0,4,73,16,32.0,5.0,109.0,186,17,7741,244,45.80,13229,58.51,22,36,835,96,163,24,227.0,208,29,6023,119*,33.64,7726,77.95,9,37,436,90,106.0,17.0,120.0,108,14,2687,101*,28.58,2292,117.23,1,16,236,68,68,20,53.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,146.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,54.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,109.0,3,36,18,1,1/13,1/13,18.00,3.00,36.0,0,0,0,227.0,1,6,1,1,1/1,1/1,1.00,1.00,6.0,0,0,0,120.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

His batting gained a new authority and his bowling greater potency, as he topped both the batting and bowling averages in that unofficial Test series. A wonderfully supple fielder, capable of match-turning run-outs and sizzling airbourne catches, he was in and out of both the Test and one-day squads for a number of years before bedding down in the one-day team in mid-2003 after a match-winning innings at Bridgetown. His explosive qualities in the middle order made him an asset in the limited-overs game. But his bowling has also continued to improve, making him a better bet for Tests as well. Murali's withdrawal from the tour to Australia in 2004 put additional responsibility on him, and he responded well. As the year progressed, his legbreaks, traditionally nagging rather than explosive, started to fizz more venomously. More importantly, his line and length tightened up. By the end of the Asia Cup in 2004 he had become an important wicket-taker in the one-day team, but his form fell away and he was dropped late in 2005, making one rather unexpected one-day appearance in July 2007, retiring soon after. Chandana then joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League, playing for the Kolkata Tigers and ICL World XI. A ban on he and four other Sri Lankans was lifted in September 2008, meaning Chandana was free to play domestic cricket back home."", '\n', ' September 2008\n \n']",[],16.0,24,1,616.0,92,26.78,1217,50.61,0,2,77,6,7.0,0.0,147.0,111,17,1627.0,89,17.3,2229,72.99,0,5,108,22,79.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,165.0,228,21,6360,194,30.72,,,8,36,,,137,0,258.0,202,34,3315,108,19.73,,,1,10,,,138.0,0.0,12.0,11,3,157,36,19.62,127,123.62,0,0,12,4,4,0,16.0,29,2685,1535,37.0,6/179,10/210,41.48,3.43,72.5,0,3,1,147.0,136,6142,4818,151.0,5/61,5/61,31.9,4.70,40.6,4,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,165.0,,23115,11704,469,7/60,,24.95,3.03,49.2,,20,1,258.0,,11047+,8058,306,5/22,5/22,26.33,4.31*,37.3*,9,4,0,12.0,11,239,257,16,4/17,4/17,16.06,6.45,14.9,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

Capable of playing lengthy innings when the situation warranted ,Hathurusingha possessed a variety of strokes. A handy medium-pace bowler, capable of genuine movement through the air. Called into the side against New Zealand at Hamilton as a replacement for the injured Mahanama, he responded by making three half-centuries in his first three Tests. Despite some handy contributions in following series, after an arduous time against the pace of South Africans he found himself left out. After a period on the sidelines, during which no other opener could establish a permanent position, he was selected to tour Pakistan and responded with an excellent series. After the emergence of Sanath Jayasuriya on the proceeding tour of Australia, Hathurusingha was again left out. Sri Lanka's failure to develop a competent allrounder saw Hathrurusingha reincarnated as a middle-order batsman and medium-pace bowler during the tour of England and The Asian Test Championship, though this experiment was shortlived. Chosen for the 1999 World Cup, Hathurusinghe was not called upon to play a single match, and the selectors' policy of picking younger players singled the end to his international career. He quit first-class cricket in 2005 to focus on coaching and has since coached UAE and Sri Lanka A.  \n""]","['Player of the Premier Tournament 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04']",26.0,44.0,1.0,1274.0,83,29.62,3573.0,35.65,0.0,8.0,154.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,35.0,33,1,669.0,66,20.9,1318,50.75,0,4,59,0,6.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,207.0,326,28,10861,191,36.44,,,20,61,,,161.0,0.0,96.0,86,7,2203,93,27.88,,,0,16,,,26.0,0.0,5.0,4,1,137,57*,45.66,95,144.21,0,1,11,6,2,0,26.0,32,1962,789,17.0,4/66,5/145,46.41,2.41,115.4,1,0,0,35.0,25,954,709,14.0,4/57,4/57,50.64,4.45,68.1,1,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,207.0,,22359,9381,425,8/29,,22.07,2.51,52.6,,12,2,96.0,,2663,1752,59,4/18,4/18,29.69,3.94,45.1,3,0,0,5.0,3,72,85,3,1/23,1/23,28.33,7.08,24.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

His sheer quality as a batsman was never in doubt even when he just entered the international scene, but for Jayawardene the biggest challenge has been to justify all the early hype. With over 10,000 runs in both Tests and ODIs - and a captaincy stint that included a World Cup final appearance - it can safely be said that he has met that challenge more than adequately. \n', 'Blessed with excellent hand-eye coordination and a fine technique, Jayawardene scores his runs all around the wicket. Among his favourite strokes are the languid cover-drive - often with minimal footwork but precise placement and timing - and the wristy flick off his legs, but there are several others he plays with equal felicity. The most memorable are the cuts and dabs he plays behind the stumps, mostly off spinners, but also against quick bowling, when bat makes contact with ball delightfully late. Apart from his artistry, what stands out about his batting is his hunger for big scores, most apparent in his record 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara, but also in the regularity with which he notches up Test double-hundreds. And his century against Zimbabwe in the World Twenty20 in 2010 was a shining example of traditional methods succeeding in a new format.', 'Jayawardene is easily one of the most elegant batsmen of his generation, but the major drawback in his career is his relative lack of success in overseas conditions. His averages in Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are all less than 35, but at home he averages more than 60.', ""In the second half of his career, Jayawardene grew into an astute captain who read the game well and wasn't afraid to take risks. Under him, Sri Lanka shed their diffident approach, winning Tests in England and New Zealand, and - in what was Jayawardene's greatest achievement as captain - reached the final of the 2007 World Cup. He quit captaincy in February 2009, but agreed to a second stint, taking over from Tillakaratne Dilshan after the tour to South Africa in 2011-12, but resigned again after a year, handing the reins to Angelo Mathews. "", 'His limited overs batting has improved with age, and an increasing stroke repertoire has seen Jayawardene become almost as impressive an innovator at the crease, as he is a technician. An unbeaten 103 from 88 balls in the 2011 World Cup final made plain his limited  overs prowess, and marked him out as a big-match player, having already made a century in the semi-final of the same tournament four years ago. \n']",['ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2013'],149.0,252.0,15.0,11814.0,374,49.84,22959.0,51.45,34.0,50.0,1387.0,61.0,205.0,0.0,448.0,418,39,12650.0,144,33.37,16020,78.96,19,77,1119,76,218.0,0.0,55.0,55,8,1493.0,100,31.76,1121,133.18,1,9,173,33,17.0,0.0,237.0,383,24,17838,374,49.68,,,51,80,,,305.0,0.0,546.0,509,51,15421,163*,33.67,,,21,95,,,265.0,0.0,222.0,214,27,5479,116,29.29,4150,132.02,3,36,634,136,75,0,149.0,22,589,310,6.0,2/32,2/32,51.66,3.15,98.1,0,0,0,448.0,28,593,563,8.0,2/56,2/56,70.37,5.69,74.1,0,0,0,55.0,1,6,8,0.0,-,-,-,8.0,-,0,0,0,237.0,,3001,1629,52,5/72,,31.32,3.25,57.7,,1,0,546.0,,1280,1146,24,3/25,3/25,47.75,5.37,53.3,0,0,0,222.0,5,75,97,3,2/22,2/22,32.33,7.76,25.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Think of him now and you think of forearms straight out of a smithy, shots hammered through point and cover and scythes over the leg side. You recall a man who could score equally briskly in every form of the game, who slashed and burned his way through bowling attacks. As with anyone who relied so much on extraordinary hand-eye coordination, there were troughs and lean times, but just as the obit writers got busy, he would produce another innings of supreme power. The bowling, always canny and relying more on variations in pace than sharp turn, became the supporting act, though 440 international wickets should tell you that he was pretty adept at what he did. \n"", ""Following Mark Greatbatch's success at the 1992 World Cup, most teams were rethinking the way they approached the one-day game and Jayasuriya, who had trawled the lower reaches of the middle order till then, had his first stint as opener during the Hero Cup in India in 1993. It was only during a home series against Pakistan the following year that he established himself in the role and by the time the World Cup rolled around 18 months later, he had already chalked up his first century in whites, a frenetic stroke-filled effort in Adelaide. "", ""The years that followed were both prolific and successful. People remember Aravinda de Silva's magical innings from the semi-final and final of  the 1996 World Cup but it was Jayasuriya's withering assaults that deflated India in Delhi and England in the last eight. Soon after, he began to exact as heavy a toll on Test attacks, scoring at such a pace that Muttiah Muralitharan and friends had ample time to work their way through opposition batsmen."", ""After Arjuna Ranatunga's ouster, there was a four-year stint as captain that ended with a semi-final appearance at the 2003 World Cup, and just as the whispers grew about diminishing returns with the bat, he had one of his most successful years in 2004. There was a retirement announcement  in 2006, but he was back within weeks, and the walk off the Test stage came only 18 months later, after a typically cavalier innings in Kandy."", ""The one-day flame continued to burn bright, and took Sri Lanka to another World Cup final in 2007, and he was instrumental in the Asia Cup win of 2008, a couple of months after it had seemed that the selectors' axe had fallen for the final time. The Indian Premier League gave him a new platform to showcase his big-hitting talent, but failure to replicate the success of the first season in subsequent campaigns was the surest sign that time had finally caught up with a man who was still pounding out one-day hundreds at the age of 39. "", 'His election as a Member of Parliament in April 2010 and his subsequent failure at the World Twenty20 suggested that his international career may be at an end, but he made the longlist for the 30-man squad for the 2011 World Cup, before being recalled to the one-day side for the series in England two weeks shy of his 42nd birthday.']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1997'],110.0,188.0,14.0,6973.0,340,40.07,,,14.0,31.0,910.0,59.0,78.0,0.0,445.0,433,18,13430.0,189,32.36,14725,91.20,28,68,1500,270,123.0,0.0,31.0,30,3,629.0,88,23.29,487,129.15,0,4,76,23,4.0,0.0,265.0,419,33,14819,340,38.39,,,29,70,,,162.0,0.0,557.0,542,25,16128,189,31.19,,,31,82,,,153.0,0.0,111.0,109,7,2317,114*,22.71,1654,140.08,1,12,252,114,21,0,110.0,140,8188,3366,98.0,5/34,9/74,34.34,2.46,83.5,6,2,0,445.0,368,14874,11871,323.0,6/29,6/29,36.75,4.78,46.0,8,4,0,31.0,24,371,456,19.0,3/21,3/21,24.00,7.37,19.5,0,0,0,265.0,,15275,6808,205,5/34,,33.20,2.67,74.5,,2,0,557.0,,18167,14396,413,6/29,6/29,34.85,4.75,43.9,12,5,0,111.0,92,1593,1983,77,4/24,4/24,25.75,7.46,20.6,1,0,0,False,True,False,True

From a bustling run-up and whippy open-chested action, he generates a lively pace, moves the ball off the seam and can reverse-swing the ball. Most importantly though, he can maintain a tight line and length. He started his career as a softball enthusiast before he shifted his focus to cricket, joining Nugegoda Cricket Club and then Galle Cricket Club. He also won the best bowler award in the 2002-03 domestic competition. A maiden test fifty against England at Lord's in 2006 showed his natural batting abilities in the lower order. But his bowling during the same tour lacked penetration and he dropped out of the squad for eight months.

That he is a rare talent has never been in doubt, but in international cricket, that raw ability has not usually translated into runs. Perhaps his fans will argue that he was asked to bat too low in limited-overs cricket to have a major impact on the game. Nevertheless, his returns were modest, and his place in the side became untenable, for a few years at least.  \n', 'Kapugedara has, however, enjoyed something of a renaissance in T20 cricket, after he was picked in the national side again in 2015. He impressed initially during his second coming, but another round of mixed results saw him in and out of the team. Despite having played top-level cricket for over a decade, he is still relatively young, and it is hoped he may yet come good as a consistent player. ', ""Naturally aggressive, and capable of clearing the boundary, Kapugedara had been one of the few genuinely exciting batsmen the selectors unearthed from Sri Lanka's Under-19 set-up. From the age of 11, when he first turned out for Dharmaraja College in Kandy, Kapugedera had hardly wasted an opportunity to push himself up the ladder. He had captained all the junior school sides from the U-13 to the first XI. Following a prolific 2003-04 season, where he scored over 1000 runs, he was picked for the U-19 tour to Pakistan the following year and had excelled with a stunning knock of 131 in a one-dayer against the world champions. "", 'It was an innings he had rated as one of his best although he batted equally well for 70 in his first game for Sri Lanka A against the strong New Zealand A team in 2005. The selectors, desperate to unearth new talent, eventually gambled on an early promotion and fast-tracked him into the national squad after several glowing reports from development coaches.', ""Kapugedera's father, also a former Dharmaraja cricketer, provided early coaching and all the encouragement he needed to develop. David Karunaratne (his first coach) and Sumithra Warnakulasuriya (his U-19 coach) also played important roles in shaping Kapugedera's career. He was first picked in the national squad against India in November but pulled out of the tour with an injury. However, he made his ODI debut, aged just 18, against Australia in Perth in 2006, immediately impressing with his composure. \n"", '\n']",[],8.0,15.0,3.0,418.0,96,34.83,786.0,53.18,0.0,4.0,48.0,7.0,6.0,0.0,102.0,84,7,1624.0,95,21.09,2254,72.04,0,8,117,28,31.0,0.0,43.0,38,7,703.0,50,22.67,591,118.95,0,1,58,25,17.0,0.0,84.0,128,14,3919,158,34.37,6446,60.79,8,23,406,45,75.0,3.0,247.0,210,23,5363,161*,28.67,6482,82.73,5,31,,,95.0,4.0,124.0,111,13,2022,96*,20.63,1562,129.44,0,7,149,87,54,1,8.0,1,12,9,0.0,-,-,35.33,4.50,-,0,0,0,102.0,10,264,225,2.0,1/24,1/24,112.5,5.11,132.0,0,0,0,43.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,84.0,43,884,575,8,1/1,2/20,71.87,3.90,110.5,0,0,0,247.0,,801,683,14,4/41,4/41,48.78,5.11,57.2,1,0,0,124.0,11,124,173,7,3/14,3/14,24.71,8.37,17.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

For the believers, he's among the greatest to ever spin a ball. For the doubters, he's a charlatan undeserving of the game's greatest records, responsible for changes in the laws that they think have legitimised throwing. What was undeniable was his ability to turn the ball sharply on just about any surface, and bowl the sort of marathon spells that would have seen a lesser man retire after five seasons rather than 18. Whether Sri Lanka played at home, on pitches where he was often unplayable, or overseas, Murali was the go-to man for half a dozen captains. He seldom disappointed. \n"", ""Scion of a family with confectionery interests in Kandy, he first came to prominence during a tour game against Australia in 1992-93, when no less a batsman than Allan Border failed to pick him. From the outset, his action was an object of wonder or ridicule, depending on which side of the fence you stood. A deformed elbow was only part of the story. Murali had exceptionally supple wrists and a shoulder that rotated as rapidly as a fast bowler's at the time of delivery. A combination of all these factors combined to enable him to turn the ball far more than most orthodox finger-spinners, but it was only with his mastering the doosra, the one that went the other way or held its line, that he became Shane Warne's rival in the wicket-taking and greatness stakes. "", 'The controversies always kept him company, yet Murali seldom lost his wide-eyed smile, or the ability to run through batting sides. Darrell Hair called him for throwing on Boxing Day in 1995, and Ross Emerson followed suit three years later. In 2004, he was asked to refrain from bowling his doosra, after it was found to exceed the 15-degree tolerance limit that had been agreed on after extensive analysis of his and other actions. While the sceptics continued to denigrate his achievements, Murali even bowled on television in a special cast, going through his entire repertoire to try and convince the doubters.', ""Part of the World Cup-winning side in 1996, he was instrumental in the run to the final 11 years later, and he played his part in some of the country's greatest sporting moments. It was his 16 wickets that helped rout England at The Oval in 1998, back in the days when Sri Lanka were deemed worthy of only one Test. He averaged less than 30 with the ball in every country except India and Australia, and he finished a remarkable Test career with more than 100 wickets against India, England and South Africa. "", 'Backed to the hilt by Arjuna Ranatunga, he blossomed in the late 1990s, and there was a period when the opposition routinely budgeted for 20 Murali wickets or more in a three-Test series. As the years passed, his shyness gave way to a quiet confidence and wry sense of humour, and he won admirers around the world for the energy, time and money that he invested in reconstruction after a tsunami had devastated the Sri Lankan coast in 2004. Often the only Tamil in the side in a time of ethnic conflict, he became as powerful a unifying force as any in the country.

He has risen quickly since earning wide acclaim with an acrobatic save in the 2009 World Twenty20, and in February 2013, became Sri Lanka's youngest ever Test captain at 25, after having been groomed for the post for two years.  \n"", ""In limited overs cricket, Mathews' all-round skills are almost indispensable.

That yorker, a deceptive slower ball, and an excellent bouncer formed the body of Malinga's menace, while the action made his deliveries hard to pick up. All that ability was also set off by street smarts; Malinga was rarely shy to switch up plans, and reshuffle fields. Even when batsmen thought they knew what was about to come, Malinga retained the capacity to surprise. \n"", 'Found in his teens playing soft-ball cricket on the beaches of Rathgama, just north of Galle, Malinga became one of the poster boys for the informal Sri Lankan coaching system and its philosophy of equipping unconventional bowlers, rather than remaking them. Malinga has repeatedly credited Champaka Ramanayake for his success. It was Ramanayake who initially took interest in him, and with whom he developed the yorker that became the foundation of his career. The coach would glue a pair of shoes near the popping crease. Malinga would spend hours bowling at them. ', 'Initially picked for his pace, Malinga toured Australia with the Sri Lanka team in 2004, where he claimed 6 for 90 in a tour match and went on to make his Test debut - he dismissed Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in the same over, in Darwin. During an impressive tour of New Zealand the following year, his low-slung action resulted in the New Zealand batsmen asking the umpire to change the colour of their trousers as the ball was getting lost.', ""But it was in the shorter formats that destiny beckoned Malinga. He became the first - and, so far, only - bowler to claim four wickets in four balls, when he took Sri Lanka to the brink of victory against South Africa, in the 2007 World Cup. He has two more ODI hat-tricks - against Australia and Kenya - and he quickly established himself as Sri Lanka's limited-overs spearhead. Though Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan also played important roles, Malinga was arguably the single-most important player in Sri Lanka's excellent run in global tournaments from 2007-2014."", 'It is felt Malinga never realised his full potential in Tests, though perhaps through no fault of his own. He was only the third player to reach 100 Test wickets for Sri Lanka but a knee injury in 2008 laid him low for two years. He was picked again for Muttiah Muralitharan\'s farewell series, but again found himself injured for a period of some months. In April 2011, at the age of 27, Malinga announced his Test retirement, citing the desire to manage his ""chronic knee injury"" and extend his limited-overs career. It is thought his unique bowling action places a substantial load on the joints in his hips and legs. However, the fact that he announced his retirement while playing for Mumbai Indians in the IPL rankled at home. Through the forthcoming years, Malinga would go on to have a complicated relationship with Sri Lankan fans and media. In that time, he also became one of the IPL\'s iconic figures, representing Mumbai throughout.', ""Malinga's finest moment came during the 2014 World T20, in which he nominally captained the side through the knockouts but, more importantly, delivered a clinical final spell to muzzle the India middle order. Sri Lanka would go on to win that title but, before long, Malinga's career became threatened by fitness issues - both involuntary and self-inflicted. In late 2014, a long-standing ankle complaint deteriorated to the extent that it required surgery. Malinga was a diminished force through the 2015 World Cup and became significantly slower in his later years, in which he also put on weight. "", ""He stepped down as T20 captain ahead of Sri Lanka's 2016 World T20 campaign, again owing to a chronic knee injury, this time in his left leg. He has at times suggested that his career hangs in the balance as a result of these injuries. At others he has said he wishes to play on for another few years.

On the unresponsive wickets in Pakistan he toiled in relative obscurity earning four expensive wickets and batting as low as No. 10. Wickets and runs were difficult to come by at first, but the selectors persevered and against New Zealand at the SSC he had a breakthrough when he took 5 for 42. The back-to-back series against Pakistan enabled Ratnayeke cement his position in the side with impressive displays with the ball and his ever improving batting provided valuable runs in the lower order. At Sialkot he produced a devastating display wrecking the Pakistan innings with figures of 8 for 83, the figures remaining the benchmark for all Sri Lankan bowlers until recent times. Pushed into the opening position on the tour of India in 1985-86, Ratnayeke responded to the added responsibility. In his debut innings combating the new ball he scored a remarkable 93 adding 159 with Siddath Wettimuny, later capturing 4 wickets in a superb allround display. In the second Test, as Sri Lanka capitulated he\nheld firm top scoring with 54, upstaging his more distinguished colleagues. He completed an outstanding series capturing 5 for 85 in the final test at Cuttack.\nThis determination and competitive nature was highlighted in his series against Australia. In 1988 he toiled manfully as Australia crushed the Sri Lankans, capturing 4 for 98 in 40 tidy overs. With the bat he scored 28 and 34 as the rest of the batting yielded. In the next series in Australia, the penultimate in his career, he batted with purpose and resolve scoring two fifties both when Sri Lanka were at their greatest need.\n', ' \n']",[],22.0,38.0,6.0,807.0,93,25.21,,,0.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,78.0,69,14,824.0,50,14.98,1571,52.45,0,1,,,14.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,71.0,103,25,2225,107,28.52,,,1,11,,,18.0,0.0,88.0,75,16,929,51,15.74,,,0,2,,,15.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22.0,31,3833,1972,56.0,8/83,8/108,35.21,3.08,68.4,3,4,0,78.0,76,3573,2866,85.0,4/23,4/23,33.71,4.81,42.0,1,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,71.0,,9394,4891,133,8/83,,36.77,3.12,70.6,,5,0,88.0,,3988,3174,95,4/23,4/23,33.41,4.77,41.9,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He began with a promising 54 on his ODI debut against Australia. His mannerisms while batting - particularly bow-legged stance and the flamboyant cover drives - immediately attracted comparisons with the great Aravinda de Silva. But despite being prodigiously talented, he failed to nail down a regular place during tours to Sharjah (1999), Zimbabwe (1999), Pakistan (2000) and England (2002). After the England tour he dropped out of the selectors' radar and returned to domestic cricket where he captained Panadura Cricket Club. Over the next four years he was a prolific run-scorer, especially after a move to Sebastianites for the 2004-05 season. Eventually he caught the eye of Tom Moody, who could not understand why he was not in the national squad. A quick promotion back into the Sri Lanka A team followed and after a successful tour to India he won a long overdue international recall. Still just 27, he was a surprise selection for the New Zealand tour and was handed his maiden cap in the first Test at Christchurch.

At the time of making his international debut, Senanayake had already taken 297 first-class wickets from 59 matches at a fantastic average of 20.50, and 107 List A wickets at an economy rate of 3.90. In the 2010-11 season, he was the fourth-highest wicket-taker in Tier A of the Premier League tournament, taking 45 wickets in eight matches at 15.17. He has also shown that he can handle the pressure of limited-over matches: in the 2011-12 Premier Limited-Over tournament, Sri Lanka's main one-day competition, he was the highest wicket-taker with 16 in six games at 11.18. \n"", ""Senanayake's first foray into international cricket was short-lived though, and after several mediocre performances, he was released back into the domestic fold, where he continued to excel. He came back into international focus when he was bought for $650,000 by the Kolkata Knight Riders IPL franchise in 2013, largely owing to his reputation of possessing one of the better carrom balls in Sri Lanka. "", 'It turned out to be a good year for him, as he also put in a strong showing in the first-class competition, made a Test debut for Sri Lanka against Pakistan in December, and also had an extended run in the one-day team. He had mixed fortunes in the ODI series against England in June 2014 - remarkable figures of 4 for 13 that skittled England out for 99 were offset by news of his action being reported as suspect. ', ""While the controversy didn't stop him from being at the centre of a tense series win for Sri Lanka - he was also involved in a Mankading incident against Jos Buttler in the decider - he was dealt a big blow when his action was found to be illegal in July.

The left-handers that had preceded him, like Arjuna Ranatunga and Asanka Gurusinha, had been pugnacious battlers but Sangakkara was cut from more graceful cloth, easing into strokes with the elegance often associated withthose that play with the 'other' hand. The cut and the pull came naturally to him and with growing confidence, he became a more assured front-foot player as well. \n"", ""Ranatunga had already exploded the myth of the Sri Lankans being meek men who could be bullied, but Sangakkara has refined the belligerence, combining a suave exterior with cutting asides and sharp sledges from behind the stumps. Initially, his glovework wasn't for the purists, but such was his batting ability that there was no question of displacing him from the XI."", 'As a batsman, he has matured steadily, and the appetite for runs was best illustrated at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo in 2006, when he and Mahela Jayawardene, captain and close friend, added 624 against a South African attack boasting Dale Steyn and Makhaya Ntini. Sangakkara contributed 287 and did his burgeoning reputation no harm a year later when he went to Hobart and scored a dazzling 192 in a close defeat. By then, he already had a half-century in a World Cup final to his name, and long before Jayawardene relinquished the captaincy, it was understood that Sangakkara would be the anointed one.', ""He has been far less relentless in the one-day arena, often throwing his wicket away when well set, but his leadership qualities have made him a sought-after signing in the Indian Premier League. With the captain's burden on his shoulders, he no longer keeps in Test matches, but the smart-alec remarks from behind the stumps are a common feature of every game that Sri Lanka plays in coloured clothes.\n \nAlthough leadership drew the best from him as a batsman, he remains a voracious no. 3 in all forms despite having relinquished the reins in 2011. Sangakkara won the top prize at 2012's ICC awards, in addition to the award for Test Cricketer of the Year and the People's Choice award for the second year running.

In his second avatar he has added more strokes to make his batting more well-rounded, but what Samaraweera does best is wear bowlers down through patient and relentless accumulation. His batting is built around reserves of resilience, determination and sheer toughness, and he had to draw into them all to overcome the trauma of cricket's darkest hours - the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore. \n"", ' \nSamaraweera will forever be remembered for not letting a bullet injury end his international career. He was in his best form, having scored two consecutive double-centuries in Pakistan, when his team bus came under fire in March 2009 and a bullet penetrated 12 inches into his left thigh. He needed surgery and spent three months dealing with the physical and mental wounds of his ordeal. That Samaraweera returned to play his 50th Test in July was a triumph of his strength of character.', '  \nHis return was a second coming after he had begun his career with a hundred on debut against India in 2001. The retirements of Aravinda de Silva and Hashan Tillakaratne gave Samaraweera a run in the middle order but indifferent form in 2006 led to him being dropped. He returned 18 months later, a more aggressive, prolific batsman and yet remained as solid as he was before, reigniting his career with a century against India in July 2008. It was the beginning of a purple patch which continued even after his run-in with gunmen.', ""Despite all the runs Samaraweera scored, question-marks remained due to his relative lack of success outside the subcontinent. Worse was to follow when he went through a wretched run of form against Australia at home, in 2011. He was subsequently dropped for the Tests against Pakistan in UAE, but defeat in that series forced the selectors to recall him for the South Africa tour. Samaraweera responded in style with two centuries when some of his more illustrious team-mates struggled to put bat to ball. Samaraweera's finest hour came when his century in Durban delivered Sri Lanka their first win in South Africa. "", ""Though he had a moderately successful year in 2012, Samaraweera was the most notable batting failure in Sri Lanka's year-end tour of Australia. Despite scoring plenty of runs in the domestic season thereafter, he didn't find a place in Sri Lanka's squad for the home Test series against Bangladesh.

He pursued a number of lines of employment including, briefly, male modelling. But in August 2002 he announced that he was returning, and in his first game back he took 5 for 79 against Pakistan.

But Tasmania released him from his contract early - his spell was dogged by injury - and in February 2005 he returned 'unconditionally' to Zimbabwe.  He was part of the strike against the board later in the year, and spent 2005-06 playing for the Lions in South Africa.

He claimed six wickets in the two Tests but his next experience, against South Africa, was a much sterner challenge and he was viciously dealt with by Graeme Smith, AB de Villers and Jacques Kallis. He was on a hiding to nothing but such was the ferocity of the assault one felt for his state of mind, although to his credit he eventually dismissed all three.\n \nZimbabwe's involvement in Test cricket was suspended soon afterward, and Cremer had to wait four years for another chance in the national side, eventually making his one-day debut against Kenya at Mombasa in January 2009.

A protégé of coach Stephen Mangongo, he won a ZCU scholarship to Churchill High School and represented Zimbabwe in two Under-19 World Cups.   \n"", ""He made a name for himself at this level when he took four wickets in Zimbabwe's unexpected victory over Australia at the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2004.

Chigumbura acquitted himself admirably in the first match at Bangalore, dominating his 67-run partnership with Shaun Pollock with a combative 40.

He tormented the Kenyan bowlers, smashing consecutive scores of 79, 68, 43 and 36 at a strike rate well above a-run-a-ball, and picking up seven wickets for good measure.  He followed that up with a starring allround performance in the first match of the ODI series in Bangladesh, taking three cheap wickets and guiding Zimbabwe home with an unbeaten 60, but could not replicate his form in the remaining games of the series. In March 2010 Chigumbura signed up as Northamptonshire's overseas player for the County Championship and 40-over league."", ""Chigumbura took over as captain of the national side after Prosper Utseya's resignation, having already cut his teeth on the role as Mashonaland Eagles' skipper, but after some initial success - including leading Zimbabwe to the finals of a home tri-series including India and Sri Lanka - Chigumbura's own form fell away alarmingly and in June 2011 he was replaced as captain by Brendan Taylor.

Selected for the 1992 World Cup at only 19, he struggled against world-class bowling, but the experience was invaluable. He soon became a fixture in the national side, and greatly impressed on the 1993-94 Pakistan tour, playing some excellent innings against one of the strongest bowling attacks in the world. His aggressive style has proved effective in one-day internationals, but his wish to dominate the bowling has led to difficulties in building big innings in Test matches. After being stuck on a Test-best of 99 for five years, he finally scored his first century, against India at Nagpur in 2000-01, and followed that up with 103 the following summer against West Indies. Campbell plays a wide range of shots, generating power without apparent effort. He occasionally bowls right-arm offspin, and is a magnificent fielder in any position. On taking over the captaincy in 1996, he led Zimbabwe to some notable successes including their remarkable series victory in Pakistan in 1998-99, and their qualification to the Super Sixes in the 1999 World Cup. However, he stood down from the captaincy in November 1999, citing personal reasons. He abruptly announced his retirement from international cricket under a cloud after he was originally overlooked for the 2003 World Cup, but was later brought back in to replace the injured Mark Vermeulen, and then when the selectors hinted that he wasn't needed for the England tour later that year.  He quit soon after for a time ran Lilfordia Junior School in Harare with his father, Iain, a prominent junior coach who has groomed a number of Zimbabwe's cricketers. Amid the re-vamping of Zimbabwe's domestic structure in 2009-10, which involved the return of a handful of former cricketers to administrative roles, Campbell was appointed chairman of selectors by the ZC board. \n"", ' \n']",[],60.0,109,4,2858.0,103,27.21,6843,41.76,2,18,355,4,60.0,0.0,188.0,184,14,5185.0,131*,30.5,7834,66.18,7,30,,,76.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,129.0,223,25,6701,196,33.84,,,11,38,,,133.0,0.0,248.0,240,26,7098,131*,33.16,,,9,43,,,95.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,60.0,6,66,28,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.54,-,0,0,0,188.0,30,509,434,12.0,2/20,2/20,36.16,5.11,42.4,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,129.0,,1737,1004,22,4/82,,45.63,3.46,78.9,,0,0,248.0,,842,716,24,3/19,3/19,29.83,5.10,35.0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

A tall, strong, athletic figure, Evans was a scratch golfer and a rugby international for Zimbabwe, at fullback. Earmarked as a limited-overs specialist early in his career, he made his international debut at 22 in the solitary one-day game during India's inaugural visit in 1992, but it was not until 1996 that he made himself a regular in the one-day side, and he was part of Zimbabwe's squad for the World Cup that year.  \n"", ""Although he had a quiet World Cup in the midst of an unsuccessful Zimbabwe campaign, an aggressive, unbeaten 96 against Sri Lanka in Colombo during the Singer World Series in August 1996 suggested he had matured enough to be able to blossom as a one-day batsman. Less than five months later, in January 1997, adventurous innings of 40 and 43 set up a tie and a thrilling three-wicket win over India - Zimbabwe's first in ODIs - during the Standard Bank One-Day Series in South Africa."", 'But, after an extended run in the side, his returns with bat and ball began to dip, and Evans fell out of contention before the World Cup in England in 1999. After two unsuccessful Test matches and 49 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe with just one fifty and 19 wickets to his credit, many wrote him off as a talented but undisciplined player who had wasted his ability and it appeared his international career had come to an end. But he continued to play domestic cricket and with age found new perspective and a maturity in his game, working hard and eventually enjoying the fruits of his labour with some remarkable returns.', 'In March 2000 he helped set a new record partnership for any wicket in Zimbabwean cricket history, putting together 330 for the third wicket with Dirk Viljoen on his way to 153 - at the time his highest first-class score - as Mashonaland overcame a first-innings deficit before Evans then chipped in with 4 for 5 to seal a highly improbably 276-run win. He set his sights on a place at the World Cup in 2003, and in 2001-02 - the season before the big tournament - he enjoyed a prolific run with the bat. Evans made four centuries in four matches, culminating in his game-changing 210 against Manicaland that he followed up with 6 for 37 to inspire a 73 run win after Mashonaland had followed on. ', 'Another century at the start of the 2002-03 season finally persuaded the selectors that he deserved another try at international level. At the age of almost 33, he made his return to the one-day side against the touring Pakistan team. In the first one-day international Pakistan ran up 302 for 4 and Zimbabwe were reeling at 32 for 4 when Evans came to the wicket. Beginning cautiously, he dug in and then began to bat more aggressively in partnership with Andy Flower. The pair added 135 together and had given Zimbabwe hope of a remarkable victory when a tragic mix-up led to Evans being run out.', ""With that, the dream began to fade. Three failures followed, and the selectors, ignoring the quality of that innings, dropped him again without giving him a chance to show what he could do against Kenya. He missed the final World Cup cut, and though he was included in Zimbabwe's Test side for their inaugural match in Australia later that year he was axed as the visitors were handed an innings and 175-run thrashing at Perth, so ending his career in international cricket."", '\n', ' August 2010  \n']",[],3.0,6,0,52.0,22,8.66,161,32.29,0,0,8,0,1.0,0.0,53.0,47,5,764.0,96*,18.19,1006,75.94,0,2,65,16,12.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,55.0,93,6,3025,228*,34.77,,,8,12,,,40.0,0.0,104.0,93,12,1655,96*,20.43,,,0,7,,,25.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,2,54,35,0.0,-,-,35.33,3.88,-,0,0,0,53.0,34,964,848,21.0,3/11,3/11,40.38,5.27,45.9,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,55.0,,2626,1228,38,6/37,,32.31,2.80,69.1,,1,0,104.0,,1782,1530,40,4/50,4/50,38.25,5.15,44.5,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He began to show signs that he was maturing into a genuine international player with a half-century in Perth and further fifties against Bangladesh in Harare. But the second Test in Bulawayo, ruined by rain, proved to be his last. His departure epitomised the player drain which undermined Zimbabwean cricket. "", 'Ervine made an immediate impact with Hampshire, under the captaincy of Shane Warne. He scored consistently as they finished runners-up in the Championship and hit centuries in the semi-final and final (against Warwickshire) of the 2005 C&G Cup to lead his new side to glory, although a ruptured cruciate in the last game of the season had a detrimental effect on his bowling from then on. Further trophies came in 2009, 2010 (when he also made 237 not out against Somerset in the County Championship - the highest score by a Hampshire batsman below No. 6) and a one-day double in 2012. He continued to show his ability in 2014, averaging 45.05 in the Championship as Hampshire gained promotion and made sizeable contributions as Hampshire escaped relegation in 2015 and 2016 (the latter assisted by the ECB who sent Durham down in their place). He ranked his best innings as an unbeaten 84 against Durham to win an unlikely run chase at Basingstoke in 2008. ', ""He flirted with a return to Zimbabwe in 2009-10 when he signed for Southern Rocks where his brother Craig was a regular. His maiden first-class double hundred and a match-saving 178-run partnership with his brother in his comeback match rekindled his love for his home country and it appeared he would return for the 2011 World Cup after being named in Zimbabwe's squad. But weeks before the team departed for India Ervine re-thought his decision and pulled out, opting for the safety of a county contract rather the uncertainty that would come with returning to the country of his birth.\n"", '\n']",[],5.0,8,0,261.0,86,32.62,471,55.41,0,3,32,2,7.0,0.0,42.0,34,7,698.0,100,25.85,816,85.53,1,2,62,14,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,229.0,358,43,11390,237*,36.15,,,22,57,,,196.0,0.0,251.0,221,30,5716,167*,29.92,,,7,27,,,77.0,0.0,184.0,167,35,3082,82,23.34,2404,128.20,0,10,260,102,59.0,0.0,5.0,6,570,388,9.0,4/146,4/146,43.11,4.08,63.3,1,0,0,42.0,40,1649,1561,41.0,3/29,3/29,38.07,5.67,40.2,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,229.0,,20452,11901,280,6/82,,42.50,3.49,73.0,,5,0,251.0,,7564,7087,206,5/50,5/50,34.40,5.62,36.7,5,2,0,184.0,93,1404,2074,68,4/12,4/12,30.50,8.86,20.6,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshire's middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion.\n \nBut it is somewhat surprising that Ervine is playing cricket at all, as a freak accident in his early teens - he slipped and fell on a broken glass in his family's living room - required a three-hour reconstructive operation to his right hand. The injury had been so severe that amputation was considered an option in the initial diagnosis. Ervine's recovery from the injury focused his ambitions, and mid-way through his A level studies at Lomagundi College on the outskirts of Chinhoyi he won a place at the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy. Ervine soon found his way into the Midlands, and Zimbabwe Under-19 and A sides before heading to England to expand his horizons and improve his game.\n \nAfter spells with English clubs Bexhill and Lordhood, and a stint with Irish club Lisburn in Belfast, Ervine returned to Zimbabwe and took up a contract with Masvingo-based franchise Southern Rocks. Ervine was their leading run-scorer in the 2009-10 Logan Cup and topped their one-day averages as well. His returns in the domestic Twenty20 competition were more modest, but a call-up to Zimbabwe's squad for the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean followed. \n \nErvine's returns from Zimbabwe's trip to the Caribbean in early 2013 suggested a career heading in the right direction. He averaged 60.50 in the ODIs against West Indies, and was the leading run-scorer across all three formats on the tour. When Zimbabwe returned home, however, Ervine refused a paltry winter contract offer from ZC and instead left the country to play club cricket for Lisburn and Grade Cricket for Morley in Western Australia. It appeared another bright talent had been lost to Zimbabwean cricket, but after an 18-month break Ervine once again made himself available for Zimbabwe ahead of the 2014-15 season. The 2015 World Cup was surely a motivation for his move, and Ervine was included in Zimbabwe's squad for that tournament."", ' \n']",[],15.0,30,2,941.0,160,33.6,1925,48.88,2,3,113,6,15.0,0.0,84.0,81,11,2176.0,130*,31.08,2943,73.93,2,12,186,28,39.0,0.0,16.0,15,0,229.0,42,15.26,287,79.79,0,0,21,2,8.0,0.0,70.0,125,6,4813,215,40.44,,,10,25,,,63.0,0.0,159.0,150,28,4639,168*,38.02,,,8,25,,,67.0,0.0,56.0,50,9,1054,96,25.70,893,118.02,0,6,95,31,26.0,0.0,15.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,84.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,16.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,70.0,,210,143,3,2/44,,47.66,4.08,70.0,0,0,0,159.0,,158,125,1,1/25,1/25,125.00,4.74,158.0,0,0,0,56.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

A handy swing bowler, capable of movement both ways off the pitch, Hondo benefited from a spell at Dennis Lillee's pace-bowling academy in Chennai, and has also played club cricket in England and Australia. He was plucked from a season with Port Adelaide to join the national side in India in March 2002, and immediately took four wickets in the third ODI to win the Man of the Match award; this was followed later that year by two four-wicket hauls in the Champions Trophy, against India and England. In his most recent Test match he took six wickets in an innings against Bangladesh. In the best tailend tradition he rates himself as a batsman - and he has made some big scores in his time - but he is strictly a No. 11 for his club, Universals. Injuries, ranging from intercostal muscles to missing toenails, have hindered his development, but he is credited with a good temperament and is keen to succeed. One of the most laidback of individuals, he hardly fits the traditional image of a pace bowler.

He struggled on his first tour, to West Indies, breaking his left hand in practice at the start of the programme. When he recovered, he struggled with his length and tended to bowl too short, which proved fatal against batsmen as adept with the pull as most West Indians.

Rather fittingly, in what was a highlight of his career, he went on to lead West Indies to their first world title since the 1979 World Cup with a stirring victory over hosts Sri Lanka in the 2012 World Twenty20 final.  \n', ""Sammy is in fact the first international cricketer to emerge from St Lucia, an island rediscovering its cricket culture as the new Beausejour Stadium has captured imaginations. He won a one-day cap in England in 2004 - although there wasn't actually any play in the match, it counted as the toss was made - and was called up late to the Champions Trophy squad in September 2004 after Jermaine Lawson pulled out with a stress-fractured back. In July 2006, he was named as St Lucia's captain for West Indies' first-ever Twenty20 tournament and was recalled for the tour of England in 2007. After missing the first two Tests, Sammy was drafted into the side for his debut at Old Trafford, and celebrated with 7 for 66 in the second innings - a performance that included three wickets in a single over. St Lucian fans had their first opportunity to see Sammy in an ODI in his home country when he played at Gros Islet against Sri Lanka in 2008. "", ""In the next two years, Sammy struggled to hold down a place in the Test side while remaining a fairly permanent fixture in the one-day team. Playing for a weakened team against Bangladesh in 2009, he ended the two-Test series with 12 wickets. Further success with the ball came on Zimbabwe's tour of the Caribbean in 2010, as he became the first West Indian to take five wickets in a Twenty20 international. West Indies went on to lose that game, but Sammy's bowling in the one-day series which followed - he took eight wickets at 12.50 and an economy rate of just 2.85 - was a major factor in the home side's win. He was also one of the bright spots in West Indies' whitewashing by the South Africans later that year, although this time it was his batting that grabbed the attention: he scored his runs at a strike-rate of 145.31, and registered the fastest ever half-century by a West Indian in the second ODI at North Sound, very nearly snatching an unlikely win. "", ""After Chris Gayle did not sign a central contract in 2010, Sammy was named captain of the Test and one-day teams. He did lead West Indies to their first Test win in two years, taking seven wickets against Pakistan in Providence in 2011, but overall the results were disappointing. Though West Indies won six in a row - against New Zealand (at home), Bangladesh and Zimbabwe - they then lost heavily against India and New Zealand (away). With Sammy's performances with bat and ball being less than impressive, he was replaced as Test captain by Denesh Ramdin in May 2014.""]",[],38.0,63,2,1323.0,106,21.68,1949,67.88,1,5,157,34,65.0,0.0,126.0,105,30,1871.0,89,24.94,1870,100.05,0,9,145,84,67.0,0.0,68.0,52,18,587.0,42*,17.26,398,147.48,0,0,45,31,31.0,0.0,96.0,158,9,3549,121,23.81,,,2,22,,,137.0,0.0,191.0,161,37,3092,89,24.93,,,0,14,,,104.0,0.0,294.0,247,73,3717,71*,21.36,2627,141.49,0,6,245,225,115.0,0.0,38.0,65,6215,3007,84.0,7/66,8/98,35.79,2.90,73.9,1,4,0,126.0,119,4956,3851,81.0,4/26,4/26,47.54,4.66,61.1,1,0,0,68.0,59,916,1116,44.0,5/26,5/26,25.36,7.31,20.8,1,1,0,96.0,,13744,6312,217,7/66,,29.08,2.75,63.3,6,10,0,191.0,,7654,5850,154,4/16,4/16,37.98,4.58,49.7,5,0,0,294.0,214,3381,4467,157,5/26,5/26,28.45,7.92,21.5,2,1,0,False,False,True,True

A former soccer player, he entered cricket folklore with an outfield catch at the SCG one day that would have made any goalkeeper proud. After retiring as a player he moved into coaching, taking charge of Sri Lanka in 2003. His appointment came as a surprise, given that he had little coaching experience at higher levels. However, the players warmed to his style, and in 2004 the team arrested a downward slide. His stint lasted nearly two years, before Tom Moody took over. In 2007, Dyson was interested in the India and Bangladesh vacancies, and he eventually edged out his fellow Australian Dav Whatmore for the post of West Indies coach. His tenure, as those before him will attest to, combined sporadic success with humiliating defeat, while the board continued to fight with and against the players' association. A costly and embarrassing Duckworth-Lewis calculation blunder cost his side a match against England in early 2009, and an horrifically weakened team - owing to another player-board dispute - lost a Test and one-day series to Bangladesh.

Buttler has helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, whilst also reigniting his Test career after a surprise recall by new national selector Ed Smith. \n"", 'Softly-spoken and unassuming, with supple hands and a great eye, Buttler kills opposing attacks with kindness, with a graceful flip shot for six over long-on and the occasional resort to a nerveless ramp shot over the wicketkeeper among his most eye-catching shots in an inventive repertoire. Like his captain, Eoin Morgan, his unflustered response to even the most daunting run chase is one of his greatest assets, his steely resolve hidden beneath a benign exterior. Such was his impact for Mumbai Indians in his first appearance in IPL in 2016, capable of mayhem late in the innings, that for a young cricket follower in India with only Twenty20 in their heart, it was possible to imagine that England had rarely, if ever, produced a player of such star quality. ', ""Buttler was in the crowd at Taunton as a young spectator during the 1999 World Cup when India's Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid thrashed what was then the highest partnership in ODI cricket. He was hooked. Somerset gained special permission from the ECB to add him to their Academy at 12, two years early, and he came to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somerset's title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somerset's run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somerset's defeat to Surrey."", ""He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of England's T20 side. A first ODI appearance came against Pakistan in the UAE during the winter, though he had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper. When Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Craig Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India. With Kieswetter still preferred as Somerset's gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future."", ""England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's as he led a failed run chase virtually single-handed. When Matt Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble - what proved to be a career-ending injury - the selectors gambled by throwing Buttler into the Test team. He scored five half-centuries in his first eight Tests, including 85 on debut against India at the Ageas Bowl, but his form faltered and he lost the gloves to Jonny Bairstow on England's tour of the UAE in 2015-16, during a period where his keeping started to make necessary improvements but his batting slip away."", ""There were no such doubts about his place in the white-ball teams. His seniority was recognised when he was named Morgan's vice-captain for the 2015 World Cup and, although that tournament was an unhappy one for England, Buttler was a key member of the side that reached the final of the World T20 a year later. His dynamic batting was emblematic of England's one-day reinvention under Morgan, though he also began to demonstrate increased range to his game - when he led England to an extraordinary one-wicket win over Australia at Old Trafford in 2018, his unbeaten 110 from 122 balls was by far the slowest hundred of his career."", ""Amid increasing demand on the T20 circuit, which included spells in the Bangladesh Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, Buttler's Test star seemed to be waning. He was briefly recalled in India in 2016-17 but then spent more than a year on the fringes, and was even overlooked as Bairstow's back-up during the following winter's Ashes tour. However, his stellar form for Rajashtan Royals in the 2018 IPL - he equalled the league record for consecutive fifties - prompted Smith to pick up the phone. Impressive contributions against Pakistan followed, and then, at long last, a maiden Test hundred, recorded in defeat to India at Trent Bridge.

She reignited the injury out in Australia during the 2013-14 Ashes and seriously considered walking away from cricket altogether, but the ushering in of the professional era in May that year allowed her the time and support to fight her way back to full fitness and recover much of her old pace.', ""The recovery time has always proved worth it. A fully fit Brunt has been one of the most powerful weapons in England's armoury, since 2009 becoming England's leading strike bowler with a pace that - at her quickest - has rivalled the fastest in the women's game. Picked in the 2009 50-over World Cup squad, she took six wickets from five games, and was retained for the World T20 later that year, taking a phenomenal 3 for 6 in the final against New Zealand at Lord's as England triumphed."", ""She has particularly shone against Australia, with her 6 for 69 in the first innings of the 2009 Worcester Test helping ensure that England retained the Ashes. In the new format women's Ashes in 2013 she took nine wickets at an economy of 3.02 across all three formats. The improvement in her batting was also apparent in the 2015 Ashes series, when she top-scored with 39 for England in the first innings of the Canterbury Test. It may well be that she is in future years considered a genuine allrounder; yet whether batting or bowling, the same qualities of passion and aggression always shine through."", '\n', '\n']",['ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2014'],11.0,14,4,156.0,52,15.6,506,30.83,0,1,21,0,3.0,0.0,116.0,64,17,771.0,72*,16.4,985,78.27,0,2,68,8,33.0,0.0,67.0,36,18,302.0,42*,16.77,277,109.02,0,0,22,8,19.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,19,2082,852,39.0,6/69,9/111,21.84,2.45,53.3,1,2,0,116.0,114,5721,3321,144.0,5/18,5/18,23.06,3.48,39.7,2,5,0,67.0,67,1461,1253,66.0,3/6,3/6,18.98,5.14,22.1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,True,True

His new-ball partnership with James Anderson has sustained England's Test attack for years, his own aggression and ability to flog bounce from all but the most benign surface dovetailing nicely with Anderson's technical excellence. And as Anderson continued to set new landmarks, Broad followed ably in his slipstream, emulating his friend when becoming only the second Englishman to take 400 Test wickets. \n"", ""Broad has been blessed with one remarkable career performance. However long he plays, surely nothing will come close to the first session of the Ashes Test of 2015, on his home ground of Trent Bridge, when he took 8 for 15 as Australia were bowled out before lunch, in only 18.3 overs, for 60. This was Australia's ultimate humiliation - a beating as raw and ridiculed as the 5-0 larruping from 18 months earlier that England were on their way avenging. Broad's incredulous hands-to-mouth expression as Ben Stokes plucked a catch at fifth slip became the picture of the summer."", 'Broad has always been a bowler capable of a hot streak. On the occasion of his 100th Test in November 2016, he had taken five wickets in a single spell seven times. On such occasions, he runs in hard and his menace visibly grows. His combative fast bowling and volatile temperament (comparisons have been made with Draco Malfoy, a Harry Potter baddie) has been one of his great strengths as well as periodically bringing criticism about his behaviour, but the respect in which he is held was amplified when England recognised his desire to succeed and ability to think on his feet by appointing him as Twenty20 captain. He led the side on 27 occasions between 2011-15 before England, with an eye to the preservation of a vital player, utilised him increasingly as a Test specialist.', 'Despite being carted for six sixes in an over by Yuvraj Singh at the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007, his stock continued to rise on tour with England in Sri Lanka when his 11 cheap wickets helped them to a 3-2 one-day series victory. He was then called up for the subsequent Test series, making his debut on a slab of Colombo concrete and toiling for 36 sweaty overs. The subsequent tour of New Zealand proved to be his real chance, however. With Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison both lacking form, he was selected for the Wellington Test. The decision taken by his coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan was soon vindicated.  ', 'Broad was already shaping up as the Next Big Thing of English cricket when he pushed his career into overdrive in a sensational spell of bowling in the fifth and decisive Ashes Test at The Oval in 2009. With the series in the balance, Broad claimed figures of 5 for 37 in 12 overs, including 4 for 8 in 21 balls, and after that there was no coming back for Australia.', 'He was struck by injury for the first time in the 2010-11 winter, ruled out of the last three Ashes Tests before breaking down again during the World Cup. However, his significance in England\'s future was confirmed when he was named Twenty20 captain. A slump in form almost cost him his Test place for the visit of India - a period when he was misguidedly imagined in the ""enforcer"" role - but, having survived the cut, he responded with a Man-of-the-Series display, including the first Test match hat-trick to be recorded at Trent Bridge, in a spell of 5 for 5: another trademark burst.', ""Broad's form with the ball was one of the few positives as England suffered a 3-0 whitewash against Pakistan in February 2012 and he began the domestic Test season in splendid form, against West Indies at Lord's, taking 7 for 72 in the first innings, which made him only the eighth player to earn the distinction of being on two honours boards at the home of cricket. His four in the second innings made him the first England bowler to take 10 wickets or more in a match there since Ian Botham in 1978."", 'His subsequent form was less impressive, however. Concerns that he was dropping in pace were alleviated by eight wickets against South Africa at Headingley, but he lost his place on the tour of India, after struggling with a heel injury and failing to take a wicket in either of the first two Tests. But after being fitted with specially designed boots, he showed signs of improvement.', ""That recovery was confirmed against New Zealand at Lord's, as he ripped out 7 for 44 - his best Test figures - and he then almost single-handedly won the Durham Test against Australia with another 11-wicket haul (six in one inspired spell), as England secured their third Ashes series in a row. There was a six-for in the first innings at Brisbane, as England began the return tour in 2013-14 well enough - only to end up being whitewashed for the third time in Ashes history."", 'Broad\'s growing maturity was never more evident. He went to Australia as a marked man, after his butter-wouldn\'t-melt failure to walk at Trent Bridge the previous summer, his nick against Ashton Agar looking all the worse because the ball cannoned off the gloves of wicketkeeper Brad Haddin to first slip. Broad had to withstand a self-righteous debate about ""walking"", a practice which had largely died out for half a century, and he was roundly booed by Australian crowds throughout the winter, but he softened their hostility by good-naturedly soaking up all they threw at him, as well as producing some of England\'s best spells, and emerging as their leading wicket-taker, on a forgettable tour.', ""He was too hostile for India again at Old Trafford in 2014, returned his Ashes eight-for the following year, then treated South Africa to a concerted assault in Johannesburg in 2015-16. Broad's latest five-wicket spell was his first overseas and brought a decisive end to South Africa's proud stint as the world No.1 Test side. When he claimed his 400th Test wicket in Auckland in 2018, he was the youngest man to reach the mark."", ""His batting has flattered to deceive. In 2008, no less a technical purist than Geoffrey Boycott likened his tall elegant batting style to Sir Garfield Sobers, but predictions that he would develop into a fully-fledged allrounder did not come to pass. Nevertheless, he has a remarkable Test hundred against his name, his stand-and-deliver assault on the Pakistan attack at Lord's in 2010, from 102 for 7, bringing him 169 - the highest score by an England No. 9. The Test was later sullied by revelations that Pakistan had bowled deliberate no-balls, bringing lengthy bans for three of their players."", 'In his early cricketing career, Broad played as an opening batsman, following the example of his father, Chris, until he suddenly shot up. Within 18 months he had transformed himself into a beanpole medium-fast bowler, gaining international recognition with the England Under-19 side and establishing himself in the Leicestershire first XI in 2005, beginning a meteoric rise that included an England A debut in only his 11th first-class match in March 2006 and a call-up to the senior one-day side five months later.', ""County cricket figured little for such an England regular but when he played (and often when he wasn't) his commitment was impressive, suggesting a player who had not lost touch with his roots. He moved from Leicestershire to Nottinghamshire, his father's county, in 2008. He bowled with pace and swing to return career-best figures of 8 for 52 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in July 2010, as well as helping them to lift the 2013 YB40 trophy at Lord's - the county's first one-day silverware in 22 years."", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2005, 2006, 2007', ""Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketers of the Year 2006""]",126.0,183,24,3064.0,169,19.27,4710,65.05,1,12,377,37,42.0,0.0,121.0,68,25,529.0,45*,12.3,709,74.61,0,0,35,10,27.0,0.0,56.0,26,10,118.0,18*,7.37,118,100.0,0,0,7,3,21.0,0.0,202.0,280,40,4910,169,20.45,7713,63.65,1,24,,,73.0,0.0,151.0,80,28,620,45*,11.92,817,75.88,0,0,42,10,32.0,0.0,85.0,32,12,152,18*,7.60,149,102.01,0,0,10,3,26.0,0.0,126.0,231,25737,12698,437.0,8/15,11/121,29.05,2.96,58.8,16,16,2,121.0,121,6109,5364,178.0,5/23,5/23,30.13,5.26,34.3,9,1,0,56.0,55,1173,1491,65.0,4/24,4/24,22.93,7.62,18.0,1,0,0,202.0,,38302,19603,710,8/15,,27.60,3.07,53.9,28,27,3,151.0,,7496,6591,216,5/23,5/23,30.51,5.27,34.7,9,1,0,85.0,83,1788,2144,100,4/24,4/24,21.44,7.19,17.8,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

His occasional gracelessness was the flip-side of his impressive determination, and in 1983 he left his home-town club Gloucestershire for Nottinghamshire, whingeing that their unambitiousness had held him back. England rewarded this theoretically  frowned-on move by picking him at once. This paid off spectacularly  against the weak Australian team of 1986-87 when Broad equalled Jack  Hobbs and Wally Hammond by scoring centuries in three successive  Tests of an Ashes series.  He scored a further 139 in the dreary Sydney bicentenary Test a year  later but smashed the stumps down after being bowled. And when he  was seen mouthing off after being given lbw at Lord's, he was dropped -  ostensibly for loss of form, but the England management was getting  increasingly tough-minded after the free-for-all of the Ian Botham era,  and petulance was out of fashion: Broad only ever played two more  Tests. Later, he became more serene but less effective, returning in peace to Gloucestershire and then joining the BBC TV commentary team before it was disbanded.

Strong-willed, independent and with an understated sense of humour, he perfectly captured the stereotype of the self-made Yorkshire sportsman. ""A doer more than a thinker"" he once said about himself, but he was sharp-witted on and off the field, had an impressive hold on reality and a healthy suspicion of fads and fancies \n', ""A powerfully built allrounder, Bresnan had been tipped for higher honours since he became the youngest player in 20 years to represent Yorkshire when he debuted in 2001. It was nearly a decade later that he really announced his arrival in the big-time, however, with a phenomenal performance in the fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne in December 2010. Called into the side as a replacement for Steven Finn, and with a remit to keep the runs down, he starred with a performance of skill, pace and unrelenting accuracy. First, he played a key role in bowling Australia out for 98 in the first innings, then he sealed England's successful defence of the Ashes with 4 for 50 in the second innings."", ""Such was his understated value to the side that England won the first 13 Tests he played in - a record bettered only by Adam Glichrist. At that point, having taken eight wickets against West Indies at Trent Bridge, Bresnan averaged 40 with the bat and 25 with the ball but the lingering effects of an elbow injury that required surgery in late 2011 were about to take their toll. He claimed only five wickets in his next five Tests - and two in four against South Africa and India - before undergoing another operation at the start of 2013. He returned to the ODI team for their run to the Champions Trophy final and then picked up four wickets in England's crushing Ashes win at Lord's but his utility had been diminished and he became a victim of England's subsequent Ashes whitewash in Australia, his career limited after that to limited-overs formats."", ""Bresnan began his international career in the England Under-19 set-up and was part of the team in 2002 and 2003 - playing in two World Cups - the same years that he won the NBC Denis Compton Award for most promising Yorkshire player. All the potential took a few years to develop, but 2005 was an important year for him as he was given more responsibility in a transitional Yorkshire team. He was surprisingly overlooked for the England Academy, but started 2006 with a string of impressive performances with bat and ball, leading to a call-up to England's new-look one-day squad to face Sri Lanka. However, he fell victim to the flashing blades of Jayasuriya and co., then suffered injury in the second half of the season as he lost his place for the series against Pakistan."", ""A better all-round summer in 2008 helped him catch the selectors' eyes again, however, and he was called up late in the season for the one-day squad. But after a winter without any honours it appeared he would have to bide his time again before he was surprisingly named in the Test squad to face West Indies. He duly played in both matches, but such was England's dominance it wasn't until the final day of the series that he finally made his mark. He claimed his maiden Test wicket in the second innings and eventual figures of 3 for 45, as West Indies slumped to an innings defeat."", ""While he hovered around the fringes of the Test side thereafter injuries during England's tour to Bangladesh in 2010 opened the door and he impressed, showing good discipline and stamina in trying conditions. He then played an important role in delivering England the 2010 World Twenty20, showing skill and an unfailing ability to hit his straps early to give England control with the new ball, before returning at the end of the innings with steely death-bowling. "", ""Injuries than began to hamper him. A second operation on a troublesome right elbow caused him to miss the 2013 tour to New Zealand. He returned to England's colours adamant that his pace, which he admitted had been reduced because of the injury, had been restored, but it was hard to accept the claim as he struggled like many of his colleagues during England's 5-0 whitewash in Australia in 2013/14. He did not represent England in Tests the following summer. His zip had gone, however, later evidenced by a third elbow operation after the 2016 season. But he committed himself instead to back-to-back Yorkshire Championship wins were his down-to-earth approach, on and off the field, remained highly prized. "", ""An unbeaten hundred against Somerset was his first since 2007 and an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 366 with Jonny Bairstow against Durham at Chester-le-Street - both batsmen making career-best scores - emphasised Yorkshire's might. It was a record stand against Durham, the third-highest seventh-wicket stand in the history of first-class cricket and it is the fifth-highest for Yorkshire, the other four all being opening partnerships. But it was his redoubtable efforts in 2016 that won Yorkshire hearts as much as ever before: Yorkshire conceded the chance of a hat-trick of Championship titles on the final evening of the season, at Lord's, against the side that took their crown, Middlesex, but Bresnan's defiant, unbeaten 142 ensured they did not concede it without a fight in an innings that would enter Yorkshire folklore. "", 'His career-best figures in any format came on an extraordinary, wet night at Headingley when he returned 6 for 19 before a sold-out Roses T20 crowd. Four wickets came in his last over, three to Bresnan plus a run-out that he made off his own bowling, enough to tempt him into a knee slide across the outfield in the pouring rain.

Its spearheads, Bob Willis and Ian Botham, took respectively 112 wickets (at 24) and 150 wickets (at 19) under Brearley\'s leadership, and missed only five Tests between them. Brearley unusually combined a scholarly mind (a first in Classics and a 2:1 in Moral Sciences at Cambridge) and a total lack of intellectual snobbery, enabling him to make easy friendships at every social level. He first took charge in 1977, when Tony Greig\'s undercover work for World Series Cricket came to light. But it was his final series, in 1981, that made certain of his lasting fame. Taking over from Botham, who lost his own confidence and the selectors\' after an Australian win at Trent Bridge and a pair at Lord\'s, Brearley so completely and rapidly restored it that Botham, with bat then ball then bat, propelled England to three successive victories, the first from a seemingly impossible position at Headingley. Brearley pulled the strings, however.

The features of his forward stroke were the distance he thrust forward behind a big left pad, how low his head was as he searched for signs of movement from the ball, and its balance and compactness. Add a sharp-edged thigh-pad protecting the top of his leg and there wasn't a chink of daylight to be seen. If he hadn't made himself unavailable for 30 Tests in his prime - because, it was thought he felt that he, rather than Mike Denness, should have succeeded Ray Illingworth as captain - he would surely have become the first Englishman to make 10,000 Test runs. He returned triumphantly in 1977, scoring a century in his comeback Test and another - his 100th in first-class cricket - in front of his adoring home crowd at Headingley. As opener he saw his first task as scoring heavily enough to protect his teams against defeat, and in Test cricket and the County Championship - the matches that counted in the first-class averages - he was as sparing with the attacking strokes as, in retirement, he is strident in his opinions on the game. How valuable he was to England is shown by the fact that only 20 of his 108 Tests ended in defeat, mainly when he failed. His most productive strokes, off the back foot through the covers (his speciality) and the on-drive, were majestic in their power and placement. But he was not the man to press home an advantage. A loner, and an insatiable net-player, he was short of friends inside the game; indeed there were many who heartily disliked him because of his self-centredness. But he had charm, and responded warmly to those who offered friendship. After his retirement he became a trenchant commentator.

With him, England were a side to reckon with; without him they were abysmal  ","[""\nDominant and domineering, Ian Botham was not merely the top English cricketer of the 1980s but the leading sports personality. In an era of discreet footballers - before Paul Gascoigne and David Beckham - he commanded endless newspaper headlines as his career surged improbable heights and bottomless depths. Within a year of being elevated from Somerset to his England debut in 1977, he was undisputed as the country's leading allrounder; within three years he was captain; within four, he had resigned (a minute before being sacked), his form shot to pieces. \n"", ""Then began the most famous few weeks in English cricket history when Botham (under Mike Brearley's captaincy) led England to an astonishing Ashes victory with three performances - two with bat, one with ball - of mystical brilliance. Every  one led to victory and among them they caused a boom in support for English cricket that reverberated through the decade. By the end of it, sober judges were wondering if Botham had done more harm than good by making all England believe, as he did, that cricket matches are won by  inspiration not preparation."", 'Though he remained an international cricketer until 1992, the great days became fewer.

He could still hit a cricket ball with enormous power, but never once did he pass the ultimate exam of his era: scoring a Test century  against the West Indians. Still, he could be mystical. Banned by insistent newspaper demand in 1986 for taking cannabis, he was recalled at The Oval against New Zealand, and with his first and 12th balls took the two wickets he needed to equal and pass Dennis Lillee\'s then-world record of 355 Test wickets.

Admirers of his laid-back approach to life,  and there are many, forever lived in hope that his England career would finish in a blaze of glory, but England's inglorious World Cup campaign in 2015 - and his 120th ODI cap against Afghanistan in Sydney - was where his international story ended. \n"", 'Bopara believers from that point had to take their satisfaction in county cricket and, at Essex, he scored consistently enough across all formats to be in the top ten of run-scorers worldwide over the previous decade: a statistical challenge, along with his 100-plus appearances in all competitions, to those who regarded his career as unfulfilled.', ""In 2002, aged 17, Bopara earned a professional contract with Essex and immediately established himself as a name for the future. He made his first-team debut the same year, playing three Championship matches before being picked for the Under-19 World Cup in 2003. Three years later, his county form was rewarded with a place in England's preliminary squad for the 2006 Champions Trophy and the Academy squad to be based in Perth during the winter's Ashes series."", 'After impressing the selectors, he made his ODI debut against Australia at Sydney, and claimed the wicket of Mike Hussey to help England kick-start their trophy-winning campaign with a 92-run win. A fortnight later at the World Cup in the Caribbean, he showed impressive resolve and class in his maiden one-day fifty against Sri Lanka, albeit in a losing cause. He was one of only a handful of England players to emerge from that tournament with their reputation enhanced, but injury prevented him from building on his success at the inaugural World Twenty20.', 'Three consecutive hundreds against West Indies in early 2009 rebalanced his ledger, only for a difficult Ashes experience to again cost him his place, and he remained on the fringes of the Test side. His form in limited-overs cricket, where his medium-pace bowling is also a useful option, has been more consistent, with some of his most mature displays coming under the ODI captaincy of his Essex team-mate Alastair Cook.', ""Another encouraging display for England in their one-day series against Sri Lanka in October 2007 led to his call-up to the Test squad and he was picked to make his debut in the opening match at Kandy ahead of Owais Shah. It was, on reflection, a tour too soon for Bopara, who scratched 42 runs in three Tests, including three ducks in a row, and was axed the following January. But 14 months later, after flitting around the fringes of the ODI team, he seized his opportunity when Andrew Flintoff flew home from the Caribbean with a hip injury. Picked at No. 6 for the Barbados Test, he responded with a classy 104. Though omitted from the subsequent Test in Trinidad, to accommodate an extra bowler, he was recalled at No. 3 in the return series in England two months later and responded with hundreds in each of his next two innings, at Lord's and Chester-le-Street, to emulate the achievement of his mentor, Graham Gooch, in 1990."", ""A decent showing in the subsequent World Twenty20 confirmed Bopara's place for the Ashes series that got underway in July, but not everyone was impressed with his attitude. After mustering 105 runs in seven innings, he was dropped for the series decider at The Oval, where Jonathan Trott exceeded that tally in a single knock. Two years in the Test wilderness followed, as Eoin Morgan moved ahead of him in the selectors' thoughts, before a return as cover for the injured Trott in the third and fourth Tests against India. Bopara looked on from the sidelines in the UAE as England's batting failed disastrously against Pakistan in 2012 but first a side injury, in Sri Lanka, and then a thigh muscle tear ahead of West Indies' visit, barred him from another crack at Test cricket."", ""When it came, in the South Africa series after some impressive ODI innings against Australia, he quickly withdrew from the squad for personal reasons. He returned for World Twenty20 but still did not seem mentally attuned, as England meekly surrendered the title they won in 2010. His contribution in the 2013 Champions Trophy was more noteworthy, though he couldn't see England home in the final against India. Later that summer, he made his maiden ODI hundred in Dublin, but an Ashes trip to Australia (where he did not play a Test as England were whitewashed) suggested a player whose time might have gone. England's disastrous World Cup showing in 2015 "", 'Essex promised to bring him sustenance as those England opportunities faded.

He owed that to an innate sense of timing: Blackwell whacked 28 off Matthew Hoggard in front of Duncan Fletcher in the County Championship earlier that season - though he didn't know Fletcher was at the ground - and smeared a matchwinning 86 off 53 balls in the televised C&G Trophy semi-final the same year.  \n"", 'He began his career with Derbyshire, before moving to Somerset in 2000, an appropriate move for a man who professed to base his batting style on Ian Botham. He established a reputation as a retriever of lost causes with bat and ball. Despite a run of scores that left his face even redder than usual in the 2002-03 VB Series in Australia - he finished with 0, 0, 0 and 1 - he claimed a place in the 2003 World Cup squad. ', ""An unwillingness to adhere to England's strict fitness regime meant that he spent much of the following two years in the wilderness, but his appointment as Somerset captain heralded a new responsible outlook, and a recall to the England one-day squad for the tour of Pakistan. His Test debut came in India, but he looked out of his depth with both bat and ball, and the experiment lasted one match. Sadly, his progress stalled when he missed almost all of the 2006 season after surgery on his shoulder. After overcoming his injury problems he slowly restored his form and remained a consistent allrounder. Under Justin Langer's tough regime at Taunton he tried to change his lifestyle, with mixed results, but surprisingly lost his one-day place in 2008. "", ""At the end of the season, after nine years at Somerset, he made a significant move to Durham. He enjoyed a productive 2009 as Durham defended their Championship title, scoring 801 runs at 40.05 and taking 43 wickets at 23.53. He held on to hopes of an England recall ahead of the 2011 World Cup, but Michael Yardy's resurgence ruled that out. "", ""Despite an impressive first-class record - he scored over 11,000 first-class runs at a fraction under 40 and claimed 398 first-class wickets at 35.91 apiece - he fell out of favour at Durham during 2012 and did not feature in their Championship side after May.  His season ended on a high note, nonetheless.  Loaned out to Warwickshire for the final few weeks of the  season, he was part of the side that clinched the County Championship title and his last game was the CB40 final at Lord's.

He never quite achieved the greatness that some predicted for him as a teenager, but he was a very fine player at international level and English cricket lost a little grace when he played his last Test against Pakistan in Sharjah in November 2015. \n', 'Even after his international days were over, Bell retained that boyish image at the crease for Warwickshire that in the most physically-demanding periods often made him appear a slight and slightly vulnerable figure, but one unfurled cover drive later and his game could flow like few others. ', 'Once described by Dayle Hadlee as the best 16-year-old he had ever seen, Bell had been earmarked for greatness long before he was drafted onto the England tour of New Zealand in 2001-02, as cover for the injured Mark Butcher. He was immediately burdened with similar expectations when he made his England debut. His most fluent early efforts tended to come about when the pressure was off, a trait that belied an average above 40 and a record of a century every five or so Tests.', ""However, on the tour of South Africa in 2009-10, Bell set about changing those perceptions. A perfectly paced century while batting at No. 6 in Durban set England up for an innings victory that ranked, at the time, among their finest overseas performances for a generation, but he surpassed that effort in the very next Test in Cape Town, with a backs-to-the-wall 78 that saved the match and ensured a share of the series. On the subsequent tour of Australia, he continued to save his best for when the chips were down, particularly during England's first-innings struggles at Brisbane and Perth. He finished the tour on a high with his maiden Ashes hundred at Sydney, and a reputation transformed."", 'When in form, Bell was always been adept at leaving the ball outside off stump, and he received glowing reviews from coaches at every stage of his development, not least from Rod Marsh at the England Academy, a man not given to hyperbole. A former England U19 captain, Bell had played just 13 first-class games when called into the England squad, though in 2001 he scored 836 runs for Warwickshire at an average of over 64, including three centuries.', ""He didn't immediately translate that success and talent into runs at the international stage - he was found out by Australia's champions, McGrath and Warne, and mustered just 171 runs in ten innings - but he gradually found his feet and his form at the top level. In 2010 and 2011, he averaged more than 65 in five successive series, including the 2010-11 Ashes. But obviously that run wasn't going to last forever: he was brought back to earth by Pakistan's offspinner Saaed Ajmal in the three-Test series in 2012, managing only 51 runs in six innings."", ""The year was a largely forgettable one in Tests, for Bell and England, though pride was salvaged in India. A first series win in the country since 1984-85 was sealed in Nagpur, where Bell's second-innings hundred made certain of the requisite draw. A reminder of Bell's class came in 50-over cricket, where he made an immaculate transition to opener. That continued into 2013, with his third ODI hundred in lofty Dharamsala, although England were eventually thwarted in their attempts to win global silverware in the Champions Trophy final. He was a casualty of England's grim World Cup campaign in 2015, however, when he seemed unable to translate his talent into the bold stroke-play required and, having been dropped after the tournament, announced his retirement from the format later in the year."", ""His reputation for producing when England needed him in Test cricket, meanwhile, had been all but banished by a series-defining performance in the Ashes of 2013. Bell scored centuries in each of England's three victories, becoming the first man to reach triple figures in three successive Ashes Tests since Chris Broad in 1986 in the process. He was rewarded with the player of the series award and a place on the shortlist for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year."", 'He struggled to maintain his form in the return Ashes series in 2013-14 - he averaged just 26.11 compared to 62.44 in England - and then endured a run where he passed 1 only three times in 10 Test innings and averaged 26.87 in the 2015 Ashes.

As an offspinner, he gives the ball less flight than he used to, but still possesses a deceptive arm ball. With the bat, he collects most of his runs with front-foot drives, but his back-foot play has improved since the Aussies roughed him up in 1997. Croft has fallen in and out with the selectors, and when he was dropped in 2000, he huffily declared he'd had enough anyway. He was a fixture in England's one-day side from the end of 1996 until the World Cup in 1999, and bowled with real guile during the Tests in New Zealand in 1996-97. But his confidence took a battering in 1997, and his career waned: the flight and turn virtually vanished, and his best moment came as a batsman, when he held South Africa at bay for more than three hours to save the Old Trafford Test in 1998.  \n"", ""Croft tried to reinvent himself in 2000, but his new variations proved to be no more than gimmicks. He did nonetheless play a part in England's success in Sri Lanka, replacing Ian Salisbury and forming an effective partnership with Ashley Giles. But his career was effectively ended when he pulled out of England's tour to India in November 2001 because of concerns over safety. Although he was picked to tour Sri Lanka in 2003-04, he sat out all three Tests and, shortly after returning home, he announced his retirement from international cricket, to enable him to concentrate full-time on the captaincy of his beloved Glamorgan. "", 'In that job, he excelled: under his leadership, Glamorgan won the one-day league in 2004 and in the same year they returned to Division One of the Championship.

In an assured Test debut in 1968, she struck a confident 113 against Australia which set the tone for her Test success. As one of England's best allrounders, her left-arm spin captured 50 wickets at an average of 16.13 in only 12 Tests. She scored a total of 1,078 runs, including four centuries and seven 50s in her Test career which spanned 11 years. Bakewell scored a fifty in both innings four times, a century and 50 in the same Test twice and is one of only two players to have scored back-to-back Test centuries - Jan Brittin is the other. And the records just keep coming. She twice amassed more than 300 runs in a three-Test series, hitting 412 in five innings against New Zealand in 1968 and 309 in six innings against the West Indies in 1979. She scored a ton and took five wickets in three Tests, a feat achieved by only two other players. And, in 1979 against the West Indies she became the first English player, male or female, to score a ton and take 10 wickets in the same Test, which was also her last appearance.

The journey was far from easy for Bairstow, especially with Jos Buttler in contention for the gloves, but prolific run-making for Yorkshire eventually made a case that England's selectors could not ignore. Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed. \n"", ""Bairstow's wicketkeeping has rarely met with universal approval and, much to his chagrin, the debate as occasional chances have been spurned about whether he might be better playing as a specialist batsman has never been silenced. But from the moment that he delivered an emotional maiden Test century in Cape Town, where his father has strong off-season links, and the aggressive batting that Yorkshire prized so highly has become a regular feature of the England scene, with only regular appearances in T20 eluding him."", ""He has had to fight against a tendency to play across the line and, to that end, he stands tall, bat held aloft, adding to his pugnacious image. Driven and independently minded, he is very much his own man. Intensive work with Bruce French, England's wicketkeeping coach, has also made his keeping more secure."", ""He was a talented all-round sportsman at an early age, even having trials with Leeds United as a right back. But it was cricket which soon dominated. An early starter with Yorkshire's Under-15s, he was named Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year in 2007, having already played for Yorkshire's Second XI and their Academy side and represented England Under-17. In October 2008, he followed in his father's footsteps by signing a full-time contract with Yorkshire.  He was eight-years-old when his father took his own life. Merely to play the game, and for the same county was courageous enough."", ""He made an impressive first-class debut against Somerset in June 2009, cracking 82 in his second innings and soon secured his place in the first XI and further honours followed when he was picked up by England's Performance Programme and included in the England Lions successful tour of the Caribbean in January 2011."", ""By now Yorkshire's first-choice keeper, he registered his maiden first-class hundred against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May of that year. Having previously passed fifty 17 times in 34 first-class matches without reaching three figures, just to emphasise his breakthrough, he made it a double. During his brilliant attacking innings, he was joined by England's recently retired opening bowler Ryan Sidebottom, in a record ninth wicket partnership for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire (which had stood since 1899) of 151. Bairstow and Sidebottom were sons of two of Yorkshire's best-loved former players, David Bairstow and Arnie Sidebottom. The passing of talent between the generations could not have been more satisfactorily captured."", 'Many suspected that, long term, Bairstow would become a specialist batsman and his debut innings in one-day internationals backed up that theory as he hit an unbeaten 41 off 21 balls against India at Cardiff before a tough tour of India showed the realities of international cricket. However, further development followed with a match-winning T20 innings against Pakistan in the UAE and after a strong start to the 2012 season he was handed a call-up to the Test squad to face West Indies.', ""It was not a happy series for Bairstow, whose problems against some hostile short bowling from Kemar Roach gained much media attention, and after a modest return of 38 runs at 12.66 he was left out of the opening Test of the South Africa series as England went with Ravi Bopara. Confirmation that he had slipped back in the selectors' thinking came when Bopara withdrew from the second Test for personal reasons and James Taylor was preferred."", ""But after Kevin Pietersen was dropped in extraordinary circumstances for the third Test at Lord's, another opportunity arose for Bairstow to which he responded magnificently. Confidence bolstered by a century for England Lions against Australia A, he led an England fightback from 54 for 4 in their first innings on day two with a brilliant 95, emerging from a peppering with short deliveries to play some fluent attacking shots in an innings former England captain Michael Vaughan said would have been the finest maiden Test century he had witnessed had his fellow Yorkshireman not been bowled by Morne Morkel."", 'His increasing international involvement restricted his appearances for Yorkshire, although he did find time to hit 182 - his second biggest first-class score - to set up a crushing win over Leicestershire at Scarborough in the Championship and a match-winning 68 not out against Sussex in the semi-finals of the FLt20.', ""Bairstow retained his place for England's winter schedule, beginning with the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. He was unable to make a significant contribution and his participation in the India Test series was also limited before he was granted leave to return home because of a family illness, missing the subsequent ODI series."", ""Thereafter his bit-part status congealed - he lost his spot in the T20 team following the New Zealand tour and, after returning to the Test team during the Ashes as England dropped Nick Compton and moved Joe Root up the order, he was abruptly left out at The Oval. He spent much of the summer running 12th man errands at a crucial stage in his development. A squad member for the return tour of Australia, he played in the last two Tests, replacing the out-of-form Matt Prior, but did not unearth the performances to promote his worth as Prior's long-term successor and had to buckle down to the county circuit the following summer."", ""That 2015 season promised to be the making of him as he struck 1108 first-class runs at 92.33, allowed by Yorkshire to play as he saw fit. Nothing was more emphatic than his 366-run alliance with Tim Bresnan at Chester-le-Street, both players making carer-bests, Yorkshire's fifth highest stand of all time. England were receptive. A combative 83 not out at Chester-le-Street after a late summons settled a weather-hit ODI against New Zealand in England's favour and the faltering form of Buttler brought a Test recall against Australia."", ""It was Cape Town, though, where Bairstow really broke through, as the summer of 2016 testified. Bairstow's second Test ton was reserved for his home crowd against Sri Lanka: 140, batting at No. 7, out of 298. On a challenging surface, he played with a certainty not given to others. England's top order was repeatedly found wanting in Test cricket, but the belligerence of Bairstow and co down the order constantly dug them out of a hole, and another hundred at Lord's followed."", 'His desire was relentless and his growing impact in ODIs was enough for him to replace the out-of-form Jason Roy at the top of the order in the Champions Trophy semi-final - a defeat against Pakistan in Cardiff.

He was 46. Reports said he had been suffering from depression: his wife was ill, he had financial troubles, he faced a drink-driving charge and was in pain from his own injuries. The news stunned cricket, especially as Bairstow had always seemed the most indomitable and least introspective of men, and led to much comment on the problems faced by retired sportsmen. \n', 'David ""Bluey"" Bairstow was not merely the Yorkshire wicketkeeper but almost the embodiment of the country\'s cricket throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He arrived in county cricket amid a blaze of publicity when he was drafted from grammar school in Bradford into the Yorkshire side as an 18-year-old on the day he sat an English Literature A-level. He was allowed to sit the exam at 7am, then went out and caught five Gloucestershire batsmen over the next three days. From then on, he was a regular, and while Yorkshire\'s affairs swirled turbulently around him, Bairstow was always there: loud, combative, combustile. ""He wasn\'t a great wicketkeeper and he wasn\'t a great batsman,"" said his team-mate Phil Carrick, ""but he was a great cricketer.""', 'His fighting qualities overrode any technical deficiencies, and he did equal a world record by taking 11 catches against Derbyshire at Scarborough in 1981. But he was at his best when batting in one-day games when victory was improbable but just short of impossible: in the Benson and Hedges Cup at Derby in 1981, he was joined by Mark Johnson, the No. 11 and a debutant, with Yorkshire 80 short of victory. Bairstow hit nine sixes in an innings that left everyone on the ground aghast; Yorkshire won with Bairstow on 103, and Johnson 4. He was picked for the Oval Test against India in 1979, made a brisk 59 in the second innings, and went to Australia for the post-Packer tour that winter. Though Bob Taylor played in the Tests, Bairstow was a regular in the one-day games, and played a succession of small but vital innings. Most famously, Graham Stevenson walked out to join him at the SCG with 35 wanted from six overs. ""Evening, lad,"" said Bairstow. ""We can piss this."" Which they duly did.', 'He played two more Tests the following summer, and one on the 1980-81 tour of the West Indies, but he could not force his way into the team again. In 1984, he became captain of Yorkshire, after Geoff Boycott\'s supporters had seized control of the club. With the rest of Yorkshire torn asunder, depending on whether they worshipped Boycott or loathed him, Bairstow seemed the last man to believe he was still leading a normal cricket team. His three years of captaincy were, in Derek Hodgson\'s words, ""a series of uphill cavalry charges"". The attack was appallingly weak - his main tactic was to shout ""C\'mon Arn"" at his weary spearhead Sidebottom - but Bairstow\'s sheer willpower saved Yorkshire from utter collapse; indeed, having been bottom of the Championship the year before he took over, they improved slightly in each of his seasons in charge.', ""He was perhaps the only unequivocally popular man in Yorkshire. Bairstow believed he could intimidate the bowling simply by announcing that he was going to whack the ball back over the bowler's head, and often enough he kept his promise. His wicketkeeping, never beautiful but usually efficient, seemed to deteriorate at the same time, possibly because his insecurity kept him playing through injuries that should have been rested. When he was appointed, the committee had wanted him to play only as a batsman. But he refused, causing Steve Rhodes to move to Worcestershire."", 'Both the captaincy and, in 1990, his place in the Yorkshire team had to be prised from him, but Bairstow had a last hurrah in the Caribbean in March 1990 when he was on a pre-season tour with Yorkshire, and an injury-hit England team stretched the Laws by calling him in to keep wicket as a substitute against Barbados. His 961 career catches have been bettered by only six wicketkeepers in history, though he had only 138 stumpings, putting him 14th in the list of all-time dismissals. His son Andrew played briefly for Derbyshire. His thoughts never seemed private, and he was a firm believer that there was no dispute that could not be settled by a shouting-match over a pint or six. Even after he died, people wrote of David Bairstow\'s ""unquenchable spirit"". But in the end, the stress of life outside cricket meant his spirit was quenched, and crushed. \n']",[],4.0,7,1,125.0,59,20.83,269,46.46,0,1,17,0,12.0,1.0,21.0,20,6,206.0,23*,14.71,390,52.82,0,0,12,1,17.0,4.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,459.0,647,119,13961,145,26.44,,,10,73,,,961.0,138.0,429.0,341,78,5439,103*,20.68,,,1,19,,,411.0,36.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,21.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,459.0,,582,308,9,3/25,,34.22,3.17,64.6,,0,0,429.0,,18,17,0,-,-,-,5.66,-,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He responded with 6 for 77 in the second innings of England's thrilling, three-run victory at Melbourne, but he never reached those heights again, and his Test career was, perhaps surprisingly, over before he turned 25.

The bigger the stage, the better he has performed - provided the stage is in England, for he has had little success abroad except in South Africa in 1995-96. Since then he has lost the sting in his outswinger and become a seam-and-swing bowler for English conditions, bowling wicket to wicket, and launching into well-choreographed appeals for LBW. On the biggest stage in England, at Lord's, Cork took his best Test bowling figures of 7 for 43 in 1995, and played his most famous innings, in 2000, on both occasions against West Indies. His strength was his ability to move the ball late, although he suffered when he tried to bowl too fast, while his batting always promised more than it delivered.  \n"", 'The great promise he showed in those two series against West Indies was undermined by injury and off-the-field personal problems which prevented him ever becoming a fixture in the side. There were also accusations that he didn\'t always try as hard as he might - Geoff Boycott described him as a ""show pony"" during the 1996-97 tour of New Zealand. He was handed the captaincy of Derbyshire in 1999, and while he initially responded to a far from easy task with enthusiasm, reports of disharmony began to emerge and Cork appeared increasingly at odds with the management  It culminated in Cork buying his way out of his contract at the end of the 2003 season, and he subsequently joined Lancashire. ', ""Although he tried hard, he failed to really hit the heights expected of him during his first season at his new county, but played a vital role in Lancashire's promotion back to division one in 2005 with 43 wickets and 540 runs. He was never far away from the action during Lancashire's push for trophies and was involved in two near misses. The first came against Sussex in the 2006 C&G final and he was last-man out as Lancashire nearly pulled off an extraordinary run chase at the end of the 2007 Championship campaign. Despite being a regular in the four-day team he was released before the end of the season and found a new home at Hampshire."", ""It was another action-packed era of Cork's career during which he was elevated to captain and led Hampshire to a dramatic Twenty20 title in 2010 when they beat Somerset by losing few wickets on their home ground. The following summer the team reached Finals Day again and Cork was at the centre of more drama as he conceded just three from his final over against Somerset to secure a Super Over. Ultimately, Somerset prevailed and it proved a final hurrah for Cork who was released shortly before the season ended.

He wasn't especially eloquent, either. And his career encompassed its fair share of downs as well as ups. There were moments - such as in the latter stages of his time captaining England's ODI side or during the interminable fall-out of the Kevin Pietersen saga - when it seemed his love affair with his side's supporters could sour. "", 'In the end, though, his determination, his longevity, his decency and, yes, his sheer number of runs, shone through. And as The Oval crowd stood to give him ovation after ovation - the one that greeted his second-innings century lasted several minutes and held up play - the respect and popularity for him was abundantly clear. A knighthood - the first for an England cricketer since Sir Ian Botham in 2007 - followed a few months later. He continued to represent Essex.', ""In truth, Cook had been in decline as a batsman for some time. While still young - he was 33 when he played his final Test - there were many miles on the clock. He had already become his nation's highest run-scorer and century maker in Test cricket, he had also taken the most catches (as a non-keeper) and set a world record for the most Test caps in succession: an eye-watering 159."", 'Perhaps more pertinently, he appeared to never fully recover his spark after the Pietersen affair and the disappointment of losing the ODI captaincy on the eve of the 2015 World Cup. He had, he admitted, lost a ""bit of edge"" in the months before his retirement. While the occasional vast score - he made a double-century in his penultimate Ashes Test at Melbourne in 2017-18 - partially masked the decline, he reached 50 only twice in the 15 Tests before that Oval farewell. ', ""His career had, by then, encompassed some outrageous highs. The Ashes of 2010-11, for example, saw him amass 766 runs in seven innings to anchor England's first series win in Australia for 24 years. In so doing, he went past 5,000 Test runs, having turned 26 on Christmas Day - the second youngest batsman to reach the landmark after Sachin Tendulkar - and won the ICC's Test batsman of the year. Two years later and further records had been broken as he became England's leading Test century-maker - hitting No. 23 against India in Kolkata, his third in three matches - and the youngest player to pass 7,000 runs."", ""His finest captaincy moment may well have come near the start of his reign. The series victory in India in 2012-13 - England's first for 28 years - was testament not just to his outstanding batting, but also his willingness, at that point, to reintegrate Pietersen to the team despite considerable opposition. Two modest Australian teams were defeated in favourable English conditions in 2013 and 2015 - victory did not always silence grumbles about England's safety-first, regimented approach - and, in his final year in the job, South Africa fell too."", 'But there were significant disappointments, too. He led the side that was whitewashed in the 2013-14 Ashes and which subsequently descended into a power struggle over Pietersen. The coach, Andy Flower, resigned, Pietersen was banished, but Cook (who had been party to the decision over Pietersen) stayed on, only to be beaten by Sri Lanka in England the following summer when he almost resigned, such was the ferocity of the criticism on social media. Heartfelt applause at the Ageas Bowl for his painstaking 95 against India to end a desperately lean run was something he treasured.', ""His stubbornness was sometimes to his detriment. The apparently unquenchable self-belief, that helped turn a relatively limited player into England's record Test run-scorer, also convinced him that he was the man to revive England's ODI fortunes. As a result he lingered too long as captain of an outmoded side and was stung by the consequent criticism. While he led the team within an ace of that elusive global ODI title (the Champions Trophy of 2013), he was omitted from the 2015 World Cup squad, ending his limited-overs career around his 30th birthday. The change came too late to spare England a humiliating failure, but their improvement in the format thereafter was telling."", 'Cook\'s leadership was, in many ways, like his batting: unyielding, determined and deliberate, but lacking the spark of tactical genius. But his rock-like commitment to the cause, and high personal standards, were cause for considerable respect and gratitude. When he resigned as Test captain in the aftermath of a 4-0 trouncing by India in 2016, he was still only 32. His team, Pietersen apart, gave him great loyalty. Andrew Strauss, his predecessor as England captain and by then England\'s managing director, generously said he ""deserves to be looked upon as one of England\'s great captains.""', 'Twelve of his hundreds came as England captain (10 after he had won the job on a permanent basis), although he made only five in his last 48 Tests in charge, more symptomatic perhaps of the burdens he had to withstand rather than worsening technical deficiencies. His 24 Test wins in 59 Tests made him the joint second-most successful captain for England in terms of Test wins, behind Michael Vaughan, who had 26. His 22 defeats were also a record.', 'Those in the know were saying that the young Cook was destined for great things from early on. Cook was thrown in at the deep end by Essex the year after he left Bedford School with a fistful of batting records. He captained England in the Under-19 World Cup early in 2004, scored his maiden first-class hundred later that year, and added a double-century for Essex against the Australian tourists in 2005.', 'The following spring he was called up by the full England side when injuries struck in India. He had been in the Caribbean with the A team when the SOS came but, unfazed, stroked 60 and a magnificent century to complete a memorable debut in Nagpur. His ability to play long, attritional innings without showing signs of fatigue - it became a cliché that he did not sweat - was evident from the outset.', ""Bowlers began to exploit that penchant for hanging on the front foot, but Cook still made his share of runs. By the time of his 25th birthday on Christmas Day 2009 he had scored far more runs (3,536 to David Gower's 2,548) and centuries (nine to Ian Botham's six) than any other Englishman of a comparable age. He hit three more Test hundreds in 2009 - but none of them were in the Ashes series, in which 95 at Lord's was his only score above 32 as the Aussies probed that front-pad problem."", ""The Pakistan attack of 2010 caused ever more problems and probably took him as close to being dropped as at any time. But a century at The Oval, a gritty, gutsy innings, ensured he would open in the Ashes series in which he proved so decisive. It's probably a fair microcosm of his career: he never claimed to be the most talented, but somehow he found a way. And in taking on the fast bowlers and the new ball for a decade and more, without shrinking or shirking, he earned the respect in which he came to be held."", '\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006', 'Young Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in June 2011', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2012', 'Knighted in 2018']",161.0,291,16,12472.0,294,45.35,26562,46.95,33,57,1442,11,175.0,0.0,92.0,92,4,3204.0,137,36.4,4154,77.13,5,19,363,10,36.0,0.0,4.0,4,0,61.0,26,15.25,54,112.96,0,0,10,0,1.0,0.0,289.0,513,36,22604,294,47.38,44429,50.87,63,107,,,306.0,0.0,160.0,158,11,5851,137,39.80,7332,79.80,12,34,,,66.0,0.0,32.0,30,2,892,100*,31.85,699,127.61,1,5,95,15,13.0,0.0,161.0,2,18,7,1.0,1/6,1/6,7.0,2.33,18.0,0,0,0,92.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,4.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,289.0,,282,211,7,3/13,,30.14,4.48,40.2,0,0,0,160.0,,18,10,0,-,-,-,3.33,-,0,0,0,32.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

That he was a cricketer of substance was undeniable. As his county career came to an end in 2018, at the age of 42, he symbolised how much could be achieved by pluck, good sense and a deal of athleticism.  \n', 'A natural athlete with a happy-go-lucky temperament, Collingwood became the first England captain to ever deliver a global tournament when England beat Australia to win the 2010 World Twenty20. It was reward for nine years of uncomplaining professionalism, in which time he fought his way through a melee of seemingly more talented opponents to make himself indispensable in all forms of the game.', ""It took a long time to prise out Collingwood from the middle. More than seven years after the end of his England career, he retired with quite a record: he represented Durham in 23 of their 26 years in professional cricket and amassed 304 first-class appearances, 16,844 runs and 164 wickets.\nIn common with Marcus Trescothick at Somerset, he grew into one of the grand old stagers of the county circuit, communicating that England's professional circuit remained a place where international stars who had known the best could still find satisfaction. A phlegmatic, hard-working, get-the-job-done cricketer, he squeezed value from himself to the very last drop.\nHe called time on his England Test career at the end of the 2010-11 Ashes series, finishing on a high by becoming a three-times Ashes winner, and by the time he ended his ODI career two months later, he was England's leading ODI run scorer and most capped player. But his contribution was far from spent: he went on to lead Durham to the Championship in 2013 and his growing reputation as one of England's old sages was amplified when he accepted a part-time coaching role with Scotland and guided them to the World Cup finals. An opportunity working as England's fielding coach under Ashley Giles began his gradual shift in the later stages of his career from player to coach."", ""Collingwood's greatest asset was his ability to contribute to the team in several aspects. As a batsman, he stands still at the crease, plays the ball straight and has a tantalising range of strokes up his sleeve. His bowling verged towards the dibbly-dobbly, but given the right conditions he could be irresistible, as he proved with a matchwinning display of swing bowling in the third one-day game against New Zealand in 2001-02. As a fielder, he was one of the finest in the world, capable of breathtaking moments in the covers and backward point. The final tick in his column was his determination, which made him go to Melbourne in the winter of 2000-01 to play grade cricket when he realised he was treading water."", ""For the first few years in his international career he seemed destined to be a fill-in player. But at Lahore in the winter of 2005, he stuck 96 and 80 before hitting a brilliant maiden century at Nagpur with England in the middle of an injury crisis. He kicked on to become the rock of England's batting on the subsequent Ashes tour. His brilliant double-century at Adelaide ought to have been the defining moment of his career. Instead it was the preamble to one of the most devastating defeats in English Test history. But after an understandable period of introspection, Collingwood bounced back with consecutive one-day centuries to secure the CB Series. It was England's first overseas one-day trophy for nine years, and his subsequent appointment to the captaincy in June 2007 was met with unanimous approval. He cemented the role with memorable victories over India at home and Sri Lanka away."", ""A slump in form in 2008 led to his omission from the Test team and his resignation as ODI captain, but he took back the reins for the World Twenty20 in 2009, a decision that didn't look too prudent when England were embarrassed by the Netherlands in the opening match of the tournament. But less than a year later England had developed into a ruthless power-packed Twenty20 side. Led by Collingwood, their blend of fearless hitting with dynamite fielding and thoughtful bowling brushed aside all challenges as England won the tournament. They got there in style - beating Australia in the final - with Collingwood finishing the job with the winning runs."", ""A difficult summer followed, where Collingwood struggled to come to terms with the seam and swing of Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif. His batting form failed to improve during England's historic Ashes success the winter after but his fielding remained exemplary - setting the benchmark for England's high standards. In the final Ashes Test in Sydney he dismissed Michael Hussey in the first innings, sparking wild celebrations. And with England on the verge of a 3-1 triumph, he chose to retire from Test cricket, calling time on a successful Test career which many thought would never happen. He had hoped to keep playing limited-overs cricket for England but a poor World Cup followed the Ashes and he was subsequently dropped from both England's teams and replaced as Twenty20 captain by Stuart Broad."", 'After considering retirement from all cricket, he decided to continue with Durham and succeeded Phil Mustard as captain in 2012, winning an impressive seven of his first 10 matches at the helm as steering Durham from bottom of the table to safety. A Championship title duly followed in 2013 as he reinvigorated Durham in a manner few seriously expected. When some bad investments made life harder in 2014 he still led Durham to the Royal London One-Day Cup and picked up the Player of the Year award for good measure. He had become a wonderful ambassador for county cricket, but Durham were stricken by financial problems and when the ECB was forced to bail them out, as a last resort, at the end of 2016 they did so with stringent penalties - relegation from Division One of the Championship included - intended to give a warning message to others. Collingwood termed it ""a kick in the nuts"", but Durham could also learn from his ability to squeeze maximum benefit from the toughest situations.', ""That relegation brought a rush of departures, but while Collingwood was still standing there was still hope.

He was unfortunate that he followed two outstanding keepers - Alan Knott and Bob Taylor - and was, unfairly, viewed as an establishment figure. But behind the stumps he was a calming influence in a Middlesex side packed with big names, a side with whom he played the majority of his career. On retiring in 1991 he forged a successful career in the City and was appointed managing director of England cricket in October 2013. \n', ""He began his career at Kent, winning his cap in 1979, but the return of Alan Knott persuaded him to move to Middlesex, who themselves had been struggling to fill the void left by the retirement of John Murray in 1975. Indeed, it was Murray, in his role as an England selector, who was instrumental in getting Donwton picked to tour Pakistan and New Zealand as Bob Taylor's understudy in 1977-78.  "", ""He made an immediate impact with Middlesex, helping them to a Championship/Gillette double in 1980, and winning selection for that winter's Caribbean tour. He made his debut in Trinidad, ending the series with a match-saving 26 in Jamaica.  But at Trent Bridge in the first Test of 1981 he dropped a straightforward chance, England lost to Australia, and he was replaced by Taylor for the next Test. The selection see-saw continued in 1984 when Downton was recalled following Taylor's retirement, and he was England's first choice until 1986,  largely as a result of his much-improved batting,  especially against quick bowling.  "", ""But his wicketkeeping, although generally sound, was blighted by the occasional high-profile howler and those cost him dear. He was in the England side which reached the 1987 World Cup final, and played in the first three Tests against West Indies in 1988 before being dropped as the selectors' desperation to stem the run of defeats increased. In 1990 he suffered a freak accident when a bail struck him in the eye during a Sunday League match, and what at first seemed a minor incident forced him to retire midway through the 1991 season.\n""]",[],30.0,48.0,8.0,785.0,74,19.62,2676.0,29.33,0.0,4.0,67.0,0.0,70.0,5.0,28.0,20,5,242.0,44*,16.13,358,67.59,0,0,13,0,26.0,3.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,314.0,405,76,8270,126*,25.13,,,6,45,,,690.0,89.0,297.0,212,64,3349,80*,22.62,,,0,9,,,281,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,28.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,314.0,,55,9,1,1/4,,9.00,0.98,55.0,,0,0,297.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

His bowling is a merry-go-round of variations with slower-balls, quicker slower-balls, yorkers and bouncers as well as, crucially, an ability to touch 90mph. His variety, alongside a deep well of confidence that helps him hold his nerve, often at the most demanding times, made him a regular part of England's limited-overs teams for three years, although his penchant for over-exuberant celebrations - he has been known to run the length of the ground after getting wickets in dead first-class matches - have been widely mocked.  \n"", ""That mocking was a cross he had to bear - an extravagant appearance meant he did not blend into the background easily - but when his England career stalled - he was last seen at World Twenty20 in Chittagong in 2014 when he ran into AB de Villiers, a man on a mission - he contributed to Surrey's re-emergence as one of England's strongest counties with great passion and was a ready source of encouragement and advice for the next generation. He has been a more thoughtful cricketer than many have imagined."", ""His accent reflected a journeyed background. Born in South Africa but a graduate of the Surrey Academy, Dernbach became Surrey's youngest debutant for 30 years when - at the age of 17 - he played against India A in 2003. In 2005 he was thrust into the spotlight when selected to play against Lancashire in the semi-final of the Twenty20 Cup, although with figures of 0 for 52, he was clearly under-prepared. His first-team chances were limited thereafter, although he showed some potential in the 2nd XI."", ""A spell in Australia, playing grade cricket in Sydney for Randwick/Petersham, helped to improve his all-round game and his first hint of international recognition came in 2009 when he was called up to the ECB Fast Bowling Programme in Florida and Chennai. He was part of the Performance squad during the Ashes winter in 2010-11, and was playing in the Caribbean for England Lions when he heard of his call-up to the World Cup squad, as a replacement for Ajmal Shahzad. Though he didn't play in England's disappointing campaign he made his T20 and ODI debuts the following summer and established himself as an important part of the side."", 'However, even after than 50 international appearances, he was still fighting for full acceptance. Impressive performances have been grossly outweighed, in terms of publicity, by his mishaps. He had the ignominy of possessing some of the worst economy rates of all time in ODIs and T20 internationals and a desperate showing at the World T20 looked to have halted his England career in its tracks. By the end of 2014, he was not even an automatic selection for Surrey in Championship cricket, and was embarrassed to concede 56 in four overs of the T20 Blast semi-final. He reportedly considered leaving Surrey after his initial contractual demands were rejected, but ultimately opted to remain at the club. ', ""He not only stayed, he gained deepening respect. In 2015, he became only the third man to take a hat-trick in a Lord's final, although his 6 for 35 against Gloucestershire came in defeat, and had to endure three successive defeats in all as Surrey became perennial bridesmaids in the Lord's showcase final.

His batting while captain veered from one extreme to another, from the heights of England's tour to South Africa to a worse run than even Brearley knew."", ""Yet so widespread was the recognition of Hussain's merit as captain that his place was never questioned, unlike Brearley's. Nor were there many calls for his head despite consecutive Ashes drubbings in 2001 and 2002-03."", 'However, after a disappointing performance by England in the 2003 World Cup, Hussain relinquished the one-day international captaincy, and he resigned the Test captaincy during the series against South Afrcia later in the summer explaining that he had ""grown tired"" of the role.', ""He played on in the team in that series, and toured Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the West Indies that winter, playing a big part in helping England to their first win in the Caribbean for 36 years. However, the calls for his resignation increased, and he finally resigned from all forms of cricket in May 2004, three days after an unbeaten hundred against New Zealand at Lord's. He immediately joined Sky Sports' commentary team, and quickly became one of its more incisive members."", ""A firebrand in his youth, renowned for looking after number one in run-out situations, Hussain tempered his fire into a fierce commitment to England's cause - when his brittle fingers weren't broken, that is.

No matter that his action wouldn't win any beauty contests: at his peak, around 1991, he was one of England's most consistent seamers, combining away movement, inswing and legcutters. He would later add offbreaks to his repertoire. His early promise earned him a Test debut in Australia at the age of 20, but his lack of firepower on overseas pitches meant he rarely extended his run of appearances beyond an English summer, and when Dominic Cork arrived on the scene in 1995, DeFreitas's Test career was over. As a batsman he took an age to mature - failing to score a Test fifty until his 23rd appearance - but he can be destructive and turned games at The Oval in 1994 and Adelaide the following winter with some fluent hitting over the top. A tendency to self-destruct, however, meant he never became the post-Botham allrounder England craved. In the field, his strong arm makes him a natural cover sweeper.

He made an impression during his time at Oxford, becoming only the fourth batsman to score a double hundred in the Varsity match when he hammered an unbeaten 236 in 2003 - he took five first-innings wickets for good measure -  and he followed up with a hundred in the subsequent one-day fixture between the two sides a week later. His Middlesex opportunities were limited, but in 2004 he was available full-time, and in May he cracked a career-best 244 against Surrey at The Oval.  Eight days later he made a match-winning hundred in the C&G Trophy against Glamorgan at Lord's. In June 2006, as England turned an eye to the future in the absence of several established stars, he was called up to the one-day squad for the NatWest Series against Sri Lanka, and made his debut in a warm-up against Ireland at Stormont. He soon became a rare glimmer of promise in a struggling side, and made himself an automatic pick for the one-day squad, and a near-miss for a Test debut at Sydney in January 2007. After helping to secure the CB Series in Australia with, among other things, the catch of his career at backward point, he was a shoo-in for England's World Cup squad in the West Indies but only played three games, disappointing in each of them. He turned down a new contract with Middlesex in late 2007, joining Glamorgan on a three-year deal. He was appointed as Glamorgan's captain for the 2009 season, but after two seasons became a high-profile casualty of a tumultous shake-up at the county. Stripped of the captaincy - with the position going to South African Alviro Petersen - Dalrymple promptly left and returned to Middlesex ahead of the 2011 season.

He was a natural leader, encouraged his Surrey side to get up the opposition's noses, and relished a scrap. His batting was more artisan than artiste but he was strong square of the wicket and possessed a tasty cover-drive. As a seamer he was more effective in the one-day game, where his hard-to-pick knuckle ball fooled batsmen into playing too early. He shone with the bat in the one-day games against the 1997 Australians - even breaking into the Test team - and later that year inherited the captaincy of England's one-day side from Mike Atherton, who continued to lead in the Tests. It was an unprecedented but initially successful move as Hollioake's inexperienced squad lifted the Akai Singer Champions Trophy in Sharjah. But defeats in West Indies and at home to South Africa cost Hollioake his job. His England career appeared to be over when he was dropped after the disastrous 1999 World Cup, but was back in the selectors' thoughts ahead of the 2003 tournament. By then, however, he had suffered the heartbreak of seeing his talented younger brother, Ben, die in a car accident. Adam returned from an enforced break a more mature character and, sometimes batting like a man possessed, lifted Surrey to a poignant third Championship title in four years. At the end of the 2003 season, he embarked on a sponsored walk, cycle and sail from Scotland to Morocco to raise money for the Ben Hollioake Memorial Fund, and announced his intention to retire at the end of 2004.  He came back for one match, in 2005, when he took a hat-trick in a fundraiser, and then in 2007 made an unexpected - and largely unsuccessful - return to Twenty20 cricket, playing for Essex.

Hoggard was one of the leading lights among Yorkshire's bright\nyoung things, but it was under the astute tutelage of Duncan Fletcher and Nasser Hussain that he grew the senior bowler of the England quartet that swept all before them in an unbeaten year 2004. His apprenticeship was long and at times tortuous. With just two Tests under his belt, Hoggard was chosen to lead the attack on an arduous tour of India in 2001-02, where he charged in obediently and accurately, and capped his winter with figures of 7 for 63 against New Zealand at Christchurch. By the end of the following summer he had been voted the bowler of the season by readers of Wisden Cricket Monthly, but he endured a horrific winter Down Under, where his arcing inswing was meat and drink to Australia's legion of left-handers - in particular, Matthew Hayden.  \n"", ""To his credit, Hoggard retreated to the ECB Academy in Adelaide, and returned with a snappier run-up to play his part in England's fifth-Test win at Sydney. By his own admission, he took a while to learn his role in the side, and his flashier colleagues consistently stole his limelight. But his moments when they came were worth waiting for - a brilliant hat-trick at Barbados in April 2004, and then a phenomenal 12-wicket haul at Johannesburg the following winter, where he single-handedly bowled England into a series-clinching 2-1 lead. And the following summer, he shrugged off a quiet start to the summer to contribute nine wickets at Trent Bridge and The Oval, as England sealed their first Ashes victory for 18 years.

He carried a huge workload and was ruled out of the final Test with a side strain, bringing an end to 40 consecutive appearances. A rusty display against New Zealand led to his axing after the first Test in Hamilton and though he earned a recall to the squad for the first Test of the 2008 season, he was subsequently overlooked on home soil at Headingley when the uncapped Darren Pattinson played as a replacement for Ryan Sidebottom.', ' July 2008']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1998', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2006']",67.0,92.0,27.0,473.0,38,7.27,2090.0,22.63,0.0,0.0,42.0,0.0,24.0,0.0,26.0,6,2,17.0,7,4.25,30,56.66,0,0,0,0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,239.0,305,94,1908,89*,9.04,,,0,4,,,63.0,0.0,150.0,49,25,144,23,6.00,,,0,0,,,18,0,57.0,11,5,59,18,9.83,41,143.90,0,0,6,3,8.0,0.0,67.0,122,13909,7564,248.0,7/61,12/205,30.5,3.26,56.0,13,7,1,26.0,26,1306,1152,32.0,5/49,5/49,36.0,5.29,40.8,0,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,239.0,,42349,21739,786,7/49,,27.65,3.07,53.8,,26,1,150.0,,6932,5273,205,5/28,5/28,25.72,4.56,33.8,2,4,0,57.0,56,1127,1553,51,3/19,3/19,30.45,8.26,22.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

With 57 first-class hundreds under his belt he arrived on the international scene in 1991 as England's Great White Hope, was dropped four tortuous Tests later, and was in and out for the next decade, until dropped for good at the end of England's triumphant tour to Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2000-01. All the while he remained a colossus at county level, where he continued to churn out the centuries for Worcestershire in his sleep. John Bracewell called Hick a flat-track bully, and though that may be harsh, he has rarely dominated the best attacks and can be psyched out, as Merv Hughes will testify. He was a gentle giant who murdered medium pace and occasionally savaged the spinners. From his breakthrough century in India in 1992-93 to England's tour of South Africa three years later, Hick averaged in excess of 45, and was beginning to look the part at Test level. But England's new chairman of selectors, Ray Illingworth, was less convinced. Hick was also an under-used offbreak bowler and a second-slip fielder of flawed brilliance. Many would have quietly retired once their international career ended, but Hick's appetite for runs remained undiminished and he scored heavily at county level, chipping away at the records as he went. After a - by his standards - poor 2005 and an uncertain start to 2006, in June some started preparing his cricketing obituary. He bounced back with a hundred, went on to score 1000 runs in an English summer for the 19th time, and signed a new contract with Worcestershire to underline that there was still life in the old dog. In 2008, Hick became the most prolific run-scorer in all cricket, with more than 64,000 runs to his name, and his tally of 136 first-class hundreds places him eighth on the all-time list.

The controversial conclusion of his career, as one of the first and firmest disciples of Kerry Packer, have tended to obscure his all-round accomplishments: in the mid-1970s, there was no more complete cricketer, and he bequeathed to his successor as England's captain, Mike Brearley, a thoroughly professional and close-knit side. \n"", ""Born in Queenstown, South Africa, son of a harsh and demanding Scottish father, he trialled for Sussex in 1965 as a teenager and prospered, then set himself the goal of representing England \xad following the route already described, in different circumstances, by the Cape Coloured Basil D'Oliveira.

Greig became not just a signatory but a secret recruiting agent for the entrepreneur's inchoate professional cricket circuit.  When the enterprise was made public, his stocks plummeted: he lost not just England's captaincy, but what would have been a record-breaking benefit.

Emburey was the only cricketer to  go on both (1981-82 and 1989-90) England rebel tours to South Africa,  and was instantly forgiven both times, which says much about attitudes  at Lord's but something about the general esteem for his qualities. \n"", ""At the end of his playing career he left Middlesex and was player-coach and then coach at Northants from 1996 to 1998 before being sacked with a year of his contract to run.

But he hits the crease with a hefty thud of the front foot, bowls miserly wicket-to-wicket wobblers, and sometimes finds late movement away from the right-hander. And a well hidden heavy ball can extract unexpected bounce. His batting is an ingenuous mixture of square nudges, legside thumps and pragmatic cover-drives, but it was effective enough to have made him England's allrounder in one-day games from 1997 until he was dumped (probably too early) in 2001. His Test career was less fulfilled, playing just eight matches, but it memorably included the 1997 Edgbaston Test against Australia. Like his father Alan, who also played for Kent, his fielding is surprisingly agile. In fact as Canterbury clans go the Ealhams are second only to the Cowdreys in the popularity stakes.

In Tests he averaged 31 with bat, and 32 with ball. For all the talk of fearsome fast bowling, only three five-fors featured among his 226 wickets. His one-day figures were good without being outstanding, and his Lancashire ones nothing special. But what the stats don't show is his presence, and the uplifting effect that Flintoff at his finest had on his team-mates, and crowds. The game treasures few things more than an all-action allrounder. Flintoff became one of English cricket's iconic figures and his presence helped to gain the game popularity as the new century developed."", ' \n', '""Freddie"" was selected for England in 1998 as much on promise as performance, and underperformed at first, not helped by problems with weight and attitude. He was always a big man - 6ft 4ins and anywhere from 15-17 stone, depending on the recent calorie count - and the strain of juggernauting in and bowling at 90mph was inevitably a strain: his knees and ankles took multiple poundings from pitches and surgeons\' scalpels.', ""He was always a correct, powerful batsman, sometimes hesitant against quality spin. His bowling was always wholehearted and occasionally magnificent, when he was probing away outside off with a hint of reverse swing at high pace. But it wasn't until the New Zealand tour early in 2002 that Flintoff finally scored a Test century or took more than four wickets in a match. He looked established at last - but then another injury kept him out of the 2002-03 Ashes, although he was fit enough for the World Cup that followed in South Africa, where he was the most economical bowler on view."", ""That kicked off Flintoff's golden period - three home seasons when he was at his princely peak. First there was 2003, when a six off Makhaya Ntini was still rising as it thudded into the Bedser Stand at The Oval. In 2004 he finally slipped the handbrake and bowled at his fastest - and also smacked a rollicking Test-best 167 against West Indies at Edgbaston, when one of his seven sixes was memorably dropped by his father in the stands. And then there was the crowning glory of 2005, when he bestrode the Ashes series and was undoubtedly the leading cricketer in the world, a fact acknowledged by Wisden. The photograph of him consoling Brett Lee after England narrowly beat Australia at Edgbaston became the photograph to capture one of the great Test series."", 'After that, his body started rebelling. To make matters worse he was subsequently horribly miscast as captain in Australia in 2006-07, sometimes looking forlorn as his team sunk to a 5-0 whitewash. Worse came when an embarrassing tumble from a pedalo in the Caribbean after a late-night drinking session, which was plastered all over the newspapers, was the lowest point of in an abortive World Cup challenge', ""He coaxed one last big effort out of those creaking joints in 2009, demolishing the Aussies at Lord's before, uncharacteristically grazing in the outfield rather than catching tracer bullets in the slips, he virtually ensured the return of the urn with the pinpoint run-out of Ricky Ponting at The Oval. And that, sadly, was just about that: the Oval Test was Flintoff's last serious outing on the cricket field. Bullish statements about a comeback to limited-overs cricket were a regular feature of the next 12 months before finally, in September 2010, came the doleful but increasingly inevitable announcement that the body couldn't take it.

West Indies were blown away for 47, and Harmison's figures of 7 for 12 were the best in Tests at Sabina Park. It was a stunning riposte from a man who, only months earlier, had flown home injured from England's tour of Bangladesh with whispers about his diffidence chasing him all the way. But as much as Jamaica 2004 set the benchmark, Brisbane 2006 proved a low point as his opening delivery of the Ashes series went straight to Andrew Flintoff at second slip and his desire was once again questioned. \n"", 'Harmison, who was born in Ashington - the Northumberland village where the footballing Charlton brothers first saw the light of day - was barely 20 when he went with England A to South Africa in 1998-99, but after that he was held back by a series of niggling injuries - including somehow dislocating his shoulder when he caught his hand in his trouser pocket while bowling - and a tendency to fall homesick when confined to barracks on overseas tours. He eventually broke into the Test team in mid-2002, after an injury to another tearaway, Simon Jones, but for a long time he was no better than promising, with a tendency to mix magical spells with moments when the radar would go badly awry. But, in the Caribbean, the spiritual home of the fast bowler, he seemed to have finally come of age.', ""This was born out in the 2004 Test series against West Indies and New Zealand, where he plundered wickets aplenty as England completed a 7-0 clean sweep. But in South Africa the following winter, the doubts crept back in and after ending a miserable Test series with a niggling calf strain, he admitted to the press that he had been hoping to fail his fitness test in order to be allowed home early. Against Bangladesh the following summer, he took a cathartic five-wicket haul in front of his home crowd in Durham, before tearing into Australia's top-order with five wickets on the first morning of the Ashes series at Lord's. He couldn't secure victory on that occasion, but popped up with the most vital strike of his life one Test later, to seal a thrilling two-run win at Edgbaston and set England on their way to an historic Ashes triumph. "", ""Persistent shin problems hampered his form for the rest of the year, but against Pakistan at Old Trafford in July 2006, he was back to his rampant best, taking 11 wickets in a thumping innings win. That didn't last as his one-day nightmares continued at the Champions Trophy and he entered the first Test at Brisbane woefully short of match fitness. The result was that wide which, as much as his striking of Justin Langer at Lord's in 2005, set the tone for the series. Harmison was anonymous for the first two Tests before finally showing some form in the final three matches - but by then it was too late. After the Perth defeat handed the Ashes back to Australia, Harmison announced his retirement from ODIs, a decision he'd made after the Champions Trophy. It continued to leave more questions than answers. A reputation, and a career, hung in the balance and although he began 2007 in fine style for Durham, his winter nightmares continued to hamper him in the opening Tests against West Indies. A back injury ended his summer prematurely and, in October, was asked by the England management to prove his fitness and form by playing in South African domestic cricket. He came through the subsequent tour of Sri Lanka with credit, despite missing the first Test with back problems, but he was dropped one Test later in New Zealand, after an abject display in a humiliating England defeat at Hamilton."", 'After being sent back to Durham, he found fiery form for his county and earned a recall for the fourth Test against South Africa. Following a successful return to international colours at The Oval, he was subsequently persuaded by new captain Kevin Pietersen to come out of one-day retirement to face South Africa, and he even went to Antigua to take part in the Stanford Super Series. But before the winter was out the doubts about his commitment had resurfaced once again. He played a peripheral role as England reclaimed the Ashes in the summer of 2009 - returning only for the final two Tests - and when he subsequently lost his ECB central contract and ditched for the tour of South Africa, most observers assumed that this time, it really was the end.', ""Harmison continued to perform for Durham, albeit inconsistently, and he was rewarded for his contribution to the county's success when he was awarded a benefit in 2013, recognition of his role in two County Championship titles, in 2008 and 2009, when he was leading wicket-taker on both occasions. \n""]","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1998', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005']",63.0,86,23,743.0,49*,11.79,1299,57.19,0,0,97,10,7.0,0.0,58.0,25,14,91.0,18*,8.27,141,64.53,0,0,3,0,10.0,0.0,2.0,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,86.9,-,-,-,-,1.0,0.0,211.0,270,77,1888,49*,9.78,,,0,0,,,31,0,143.0,67,34,267,25*,8.09,,,0,0,,,23,0,28.0,6,1,11,6,2.20,13,84.61,0,0,2,0,3,0,63.0,115,13375,7192,226.0,7/12,11/76,31.82,3.22,59.1,11,8,1,58.0,57,2899,2481,76.0,5/33,5/33,32.64,5.13,38.1,2,1,0,2.0,2,39,42,1.0,1/13,1/13,42.00,6.46,39.0,0,0,0,211.0,,39374,20805,744,7/12,,27.96,3.17,52.9,,27,1,143.0,,6838,5658,184,5/33,5/33,30.75,4.96,37.1,6,1,0,28.0,25,505,668,29,5/41,5/41,23.03,7.93,17.4,2,1,0,False,False,False,False

Pinging the ball down from the clouds he has the heady blend of pace and trampolining bounce to rattle the best players.  At his best, his potential looks immense, but he is a gentle character given to periods of technical self-doubt and his career has often been fraught with uncertainty. \n"", 'Finn\'s career went into reverse in 2013/14. Issues with his delivery stride - a habit of kneeing the stumps led to a Law change making it a no-ball - and control meant he has been in and out of the side. Endless tinkering with his action then left him visibly bereft of confidence. He was the only member of England\'s vanquished Ashes Test squad not to play in the 5-0 whitewash and cut a forlorn figure on the practice grounds as his action was stripped right back to basics. It all led to him being sent home from England\'s tour of Australia after being deemed ""not selectable"" - an honest and sympathetic assessment - by his one-day coach Ashley Giles.', ""What followed was a long period of rehabilitation and many long hours in winter nets at Finchley CC. In 2014, his 48 first-class wickets showed progress, even if his pace and consistency were inconsistent, but the input of a host of coaches slowly brought dividends and led to his return in England's victorious Ashes series after a two-year absence in which he had been limited only to limited-overs appearances for his country. The unveiling of a new outswinger and the particular joy of a six-wicket haul at Edgbaston gave him the confidence to pronounce that the past was behind him."", ""Finn made his county debut for Middlesex as a 16-year-old in 2005, the youngest to do so since Fred Titmus in 1949, and was earmarked as an England prospect from his early days, representing England at all age-group levels from Under-16s upwards. He enjoyed a solid 2009 season for Middlesex, taking 53 wickets at 30.64 in the Championship, and then did well for England Lions in the UAE. With Stuart Broad, Graham Onions and Ryan Sidebottom all picking up injuries early on England's tour to Bangladesh, Finn was parachuted in as cover. Barely 24 hours after arriving in the country he was playing in the warm-up game against Bangladesh A and impressed on his Test debut three days later, displaying good pace and bounce on a docile Chittagong surface."", ""With the England management desperately searching for a consistent replacement for Steve Harmison, Finn marked his home debut, also against Bangladesh, in style. In the familiar surroundings of Lord's, he carried a rusty England attack with 4 for 100 in the first innings and went one better in the second, taking 5 for 87 to finish with nine in the game and the man-of-the-match medal in just his third Test."", ""He kept his place against Pakistan and despite doubts as to whether he was ready for the challenge of a tour of Australia, Finn fronted up impressively in his early outings. He claimed a career-best 6 for 125 to help turn the tide in the first Test at the Gabba, before stepping into the breach left by an injury to Stuart Broad to help seal victory in the second Test at Adelaide. Though he faded at Perth and was omitted from the last two matches, he'd done enough to confirm his promise."", 'A single Test appearance in 2011 followed, during which he became the youngest Englishman to 50 wickets, but Tim Bresnan and Chris Tremlett moved ahead of him in third-seamer pecking order. An impressive tour of India pushed him firmly into one-day contention, however, and he was a virtual ever-present in limited-overs cricket in 2012, as England briefly topped the ODI rankings but failed in their World Twenty20 defence.', ""Finn won a Test recall against South Africa but a habit of hitting the stumps in his delivery stride became costly when Graeme Smith drew attention to it at Headingley. The umpires decided to call dead ball and Finn was denied Smith's wicket. A few months later, 'Finn's Law' was created, making any wicket taken after a bowler had knocked over the stumps a no ball. "", ""Injury curtailed Finn's involvement in the historic Test series win in India but he was back in the XI in New Zealand, beginning his longest run in the side since his debut. A shortened run-up was experimented with before being abandoned but his rhythm had been affected and, having played just once in England's Champions Trophy campaign, he was dropped after the first Test of the 2013 Ashes. After his tumultuous winter in 2013/14, he rebuilt his confidence with the aid of Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson and was rewarded with an ODI recall against India in August 2014. For all the problems, further success in the 2015 Ashes series left England still convinced that Finn was a bowler of rare potential."", ""A stress fracture of the foot ruled him out of a series against Pakistan in the UAE but his recovery on a Lions tour of the Emirates was swift and he was called into England's South Africa squad ahead of the first Test."", ""If the collapse of his action in Australia in 2013/14 was a low point, he was successful enough to proclaim in England's 2015 Ashes victory that his problems were behind him, encouraged by a Test-best 6 for 79 at Edgbaston. He acquitted himself ably enough, too during England's series win in South Africa, only for his career to take another twist when he lost his limited-overs place just as he returned to Test cricket."", 'Another Australia tour beckoned. Finn, who had been out of the Test side for a year,did not make the original party, but he was called up in place of Ben Stokes after Stokes became embroiled in a police investigation after a fracas outside a Bristol night club. Four years after his horrendous Ashes experience, Finn had a chance to make amends only to be rulked out of the tour with a torn left knee cartilage.\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2009', 'ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2010', ""Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketers of the Year 2010""]",36.0,47,22,279.0,56,11.16,901,30.96,0,1,36,0,8.0,0.0,69.0,30,13,136.0,35,8.0,223,60.98,0,0,11,3,15.0,0.0,21.0,3,3,14.0,8*,-,19,73.68,0,0,1,0,6.0,0.0,149.0,182,59,1111,56,9.03,2913,38.13,0,1,150,5,47,0,142.0,57,23,368,42*,10.82,569,64.67,0,0,33,8,31,0,88.0,17,12,55,8*,11.00,65,84.61,0,0,5,0,21,0,36.0,66,6412,3800,125.0,6/79,9/187,30.4,3.55,51.2,6,5,0,69.0,67,3550,2996,102.0,5/33,5/33,29.37,5.06,34.8,4,2,0,21.0,21,480,583,27.0,3/16,3/16,21.59,7.28,17.7,0,0,0,149.0,,26646,15381,531,9/37,,28.96,3.46,50.1,29,13,1,142.0,138,6737,5762,200,5/33,5/33,28.81,5.13,33.6,7,3,0,88.0,86,1826,2323,104,4/24,4/24,22.33,7.63,17.5,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

6 ft 4 in ",,,Right-hand bat,Slow left-arm orthodox,,,,"['\nThe Ashley Giles story is an endearing tale of one man\'s triumph over the doubters. With a high-trotting approach to the crease climaxing in an energetic flurry of limbs, Giles did not have the most fluent spin-bowling action - possibly because he began life as a fast bowler - and was once derided as a ""wheely-bin"", much to his own annoyance. But he was accurate, found some turn and even more bounce, and he established himself as a dependable spinner for England in five seasons at the turn of the century. \n', ""Giles was forced into retirement by injury in 2007 but quickly became a coach, first at Warwickshire and then with the England limited-overs sides. He missed out on becoming England's full-time coach in 2014 and came back to county cricket with Lancashire."", ""Throughout his playing career, Giles had to justify his selection at almost every moment of uncertainty, and in early 2004 he came close to retirement after a modest tour of the Caribbean. Instead, he returned a matchwinning nine-wicket haul at Lord's later that summer, and imbued with new confidence, he continued to chip in with vital performances - with ball and increasingly, with bat - culminating in his career-best 59 at The Oval, an innings which helped seal England's first Ashes victory for 18 years."", ""Until his late flowering, Giles's most memorable moments had all come on his three tours of the subcontinent. The rip-snorting delivery that pitched outside leg and fizzed past Inzamam-ul-Haq's dangling bat on to the stumps at Karachi was the best piece of bowling by an England spinner since Phil Tufnell teased the Aussies at The Oval in 1997, and paved the way for a famous victory. It was on that tour of Pakistan in 2000-01 that Giles became England's No. 1 slow bowler. "", ""The following winter, and nursing a persistent Achilles injury, he hobbled back and forth from the middle to the physio's ice bucket, while returning Test-best figures of 5 for 67 at Ahmedabad. And, two years later, after remodelling his action and enduring a dismal tour to Bangladesh, he burst back to form in Sri Lanka, with 18 wickets in the series and a magnificent match-saving stand in the first Test at Galle. "", ""It was just the latest of many impressive batting performances from a man who had worked hard at his game to become a pivotal player in England's lower order, and against New Zealand at Trent Bridge in 2004 his stand with Graham Thorpe was instrumental in England's triumph. One month later at Lord's, he produced a wickedly ripping delivery to bowl Brian Lara - his 100th wicket in Tests, weeks after being virtually written off by the press. In the field he had a strong arm and was agile for a man of his size, but a persistent hip injury ruled him out of England contention throughout 2006. "", ""Though his skills as a utility player continued to appeal to his coach, Duncan Fletcher, the strides made by his replacement, Monty Panesar, put a return to the fold in jeopardy. Giles kept Panesar out of the team for the first two Tests of the 2006-07 Ashes, but with such a lack of cricket the folly of the selection was soon exposed. He took just two wickets before Panesar returned at Perth with a five-wicket haul. Giles' tour was brought to a premature end when he flew home to be with his ill wife. "", ""Any chance of a return to England colours vanished when a recurrence of his hip problem forced him to announce his retirement towards the end of the 2007 season but within weeks he had been appointed as Warwickshire's director of cricket. Following a shakeup with the England selection panel, he was named a part-time selector alongside James Whitaker, as David Graveney's 11-year reign as chief selector came to an end and, most significantly, in late 2012 was named England's limited-overs coach as Andy Flower's workload was lightened. He led England on a modest World T20 campaign in Bangladesh in 2014 and then missed out the full-time role to Peter Moores."", 'After a brief period out of the game, he was reappointed as director of cricket by Warwickshire at the end of the 2016 season. The club was subsequently relegated in 2017, though the emergence of some young player and some improved form in T20 cricket - Birmingham reached the final of the domestic competition - provided some hope of better times to come.']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1996,1997', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005']",54.0,81,13,1421.0,59,20.89,3064,46.37,0,4,175,5,33.0,0.0,62.0,35,13,385.0,41,17.5,551,69.87,0,0,24,4,22.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,178.0,249,46,5346,128*,26.33,,,3,22,,,80,0,224.0,141,41,2089,107,20.89,,,1,5,,,73,0,2.0,1,1,0,0*,-,1,0.00,0,0,0,0,0,0,54.0,88,12180,5806,143.0,5/57,9/122,40.6,2.86,85.1,11,5,0,62.0,57,2856,2069,55.0,5/57,5/57,37.61,4.34,51.9,0,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,178.0,,37304,15958,539,8/90,,29.60,2.56,69.2,,26,3,224.0,,9729,6961,272,5/21,5/21,25.59,4.29,35.7,5,3,0,2.0,2,42,34,2,2/21,2/21,17.00,4.85,21.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Squat and  tubby, he never looked a sportsmen from a distance, though at close quarters his oak-tree forearms gave a clue. He was a natural, a point recognised by the selectors when they sent him on tour as a 20-year-old, in 1977-78. But it would take seven more years, and 54 Test innings, before he made a hundred.

Gatting's bristling had got the better of him. It took six months for Gatting to be sacked, and then it was ostensibly (and ludicrously) because of an alleged sexual encounter with a barmaid. The selectors wanted him back in 1989 but their choice was  vetoed; Gatting, in pique and sadness, took a rebel team to South Africa instead and the captaincy never came back to him.

If English cricket was still not debating the enforced removal of Kevin Pietersen from international cricket, it was arguing over the conservative approach towards one-day batting at the top of the order. Hales, a tall batsman with a destructive range of offside drives and cuts, was one of a brazen new breed of England batsmen who changed the conversation into something much more positive. \n', 'It took 32 international Twenty20 appearances - strikingly good figures, too, with an average of 38 and a strike rate approaching 140 - before Hales finally won ODI recognition from England selectors who mistrusted his technique against the short ball and his ability to build an innings. ', ""There followed a comparable wait before England considered a further transition - from ODI batsman to Test opener. His 24 ODIs had brought modest success - his average in the mid-20s - but a timely maiden ODI hundred against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi helped to propel him into England's Test squad for their 2015/16 tour of South Africa as he became the eighth opener to try to fill the gap left by Andrew Strauss' Test retirement more than three years earlier. England had exhibited a wish to play a more expansive game at Test level and that worked in his favour."", ""Eleven Tests from the Boxing Day meeting with South Africa in Durban in 2015 until The Oval brought down the curtain on the 2016 English summer against Pakistan represented a decent run in which to establish himself, but he did not take easily to the tempo and technique at Test level. In three successive Tests against Sri Lanka - at Headingley, Chester-le-Street and Lord's - he passed 80 without securing the maiden Test century he craved and which might have been a harbinger for better things. When he chose, along with his limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan, not to tour Bangladesh for safety reasons (the tour passed off uneventfully amid high security) he also found himself omitted from the subsequent India tour because of his doubts about his capacity against spin bowling. "", ""In one-day cricket, though, his prowess was evident. When he lashed 171 during the third ODI against Pakistan on his home soil at Trent Bridge in 2016, he broke the England record previously held by Robin Smith for 23 years. Hales' innings also helped England achieve the highest ever team ODI score in the same game - 444-3, bettering the previous record of 443 by Sri Lanka back in 2006."", 'Off the field, he was present with Ben Stokes when Stokes was charged of affray (for which he was found not guilty) outside a Bristol night club in September 2017; Hales was not charged.', 'Early in February 2018, Hales committed himself solely to limited-overs cricket by signing a white-ball only contract with Nottinghamshire and playing IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad. He had averaged 27.28 in his 11 Tests, and prospects of further opportunities were minimal, although he did signal his intention to reconsider his future after the 2019 World Cup. His ODI form remained occasionally devastating and he struck 147 during that rarest of things - a whitewash in a one-day series against Australia', 'At 6 foot 5, Hales has always hit with a stately intent. His England T20 debut came in 2011, to which he responded after a debut duck against India by scoring an unbeaten 62 off 48 balls as England beat West Indies at the Oval. In his first Twenty20 international of 2012, against West Indies again, he failed by one run to become the first batsman to score a century for England in the short format on his home ground of Trent Bridge, in June. He promised much in a largely ill-starred England campaign in the 2012 World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, although his innings tended to run out of steam. That first hundred by an England batsman finally came in the 2013 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh when he made an unbeaten 116 from 64 balls against Sri Lanka in Chittagong, striking a six over midwicket to secure a last-over victory. ', 'His reputation in T20 cricket grew and he earned a late deal with Melbourne Renegades for two matches of the 2012/13 Big Bash. His debut brought a brutal 89 in just 52 balls at the SCG.', 'In four-day cricket he initially progressed well, earning his county cap after scoring 184 against Somerset at Trent Bridge on his way to topping 1,000 first-class runs in the season for the first time, despite missing almost seven weeks of the campaign with a broken jaw. He added 857 first-class runs in 2012, including two centuries in August.', 'But there followed a disastrous 2013 Championship season in which Hales virtually lost interest and averaged 13.94, being advised by England as a result that he was in danger of becoming a two-dimensional Twenty20 specialist. He decided to work harder on his four-day cricket - although only after he was overlooked in the IPL 2014 draft. English players were often passed over, with their availability so uncertain, but this omission was more curious than many: his reputation had not spread outside England. No matter, he settled into Championship cricket with 954 runs at 50, perhaps his finest Championship season.', ""He had been part of England's ODI squad to the West Indies but missed out on a debut through injury. Finally, three one-day hundreds in as many weeks for Nottinghamshire, including a 96-ball 141 against Middlesex, added to the clamour for his selection.

He cut a similar figure to Alec Stewart with his no-nonsense positivity, even if he did not quite possess the same fastidious attention towards his appearance. \n', ""Prior's reputation reached its peak after England's tour of New Zealand in 2013. He saved the final Test in Auckland, and the series, with a defiant, out-of-character century - batting for four-and-a-half hours for an unbeaten 110, an innings which epitomised England's spirit. He won England's Player of the Year award and his ability to rouse the mood with Churchillian speeches led him to be named as vice captain for the Ashes tour to Australia in 2013-14. But back-to-back Ashes tours treated him unkindly, bringing a marked slump in his form and his keeping standards and he made only one fifty in eight Tests; even that, a counterattacking affair in Perth with the game lost, had an air of desperation. He was dropped for Jonny Bairstow for the final two Tests in Australia and, although he still possessed a Test average above 40, began the 2014 county season with Sussex with his Test spot seriously in question."", ""He was patched up for the first four Tests of the summer - two against Sri Lanka and two against India - but his long-standing Achilles problems severely hampered his wicketkeeping and a subsequent operation revealed such damage that it was amazing he had even taken the field. The last thing he needed was for his commitment to the cause to be demeaned so savagely at the end of the season in Kevin Pietersen's autobiography. He admitted that he was not entirely sure his first-class career could be salvaged and, with an eye to the future, committed his energies to forming a cycling team. With hindsight, it proved a shrewd move and he announced his injury-induced retirement in June 2015."", ""Prior moved to England from South Africa and represented England at all ages, up to and including Under-19s, making his Sussex debut in 2001 as a 19-year-old. He was selected to tour Zimbabwe as part of England's one-day squad in November 2004 and played in just one match, striking 35. He made England's winter squads for Pakistan and India in 2005-06, but played mostly as a batsman in the ODIs and failed to make any real impact. He missed out on the Champions Trophy in October 2006 but was named in the Academy squad to be stationed in Perth during the 2006-07 Ashes series. "", ""Geraint Jones and Chris Read flunked their chances during England's shambolic Ashes campaign, which meant Prior was ready to step into the Test side and launch Peter Moores' period at the helm. He began in thrilling fashion, becoming the first England wicketkeeper to score a century on debut with an unbeaten 126 at Lord's, followed by 75 at Headingley, and England's wicketkeeper problem looked settled. But no sooner was the position sorted than things started going awry. He struggled against India and was a key protagonist in the jellybean fiasco that goaded Zaheer Khan to bowl out England at Trent Bridge before a grim tour to Sri Lanka exposed deep flaws in his keeping. Some misplaced levels of sledging also did not endear him to everybody and he was dropped for England's tour of New Zealand in 2008, with his old Sussex rival, Tim Ambrose - now at Warwickshire - taking the gloves. "", ""But Prior's extra batting class could not be ignored for long, and he returned to the side before the year was out, with his keeping vastly improved during his spell on the outside. He was one of the unsung heroes of England's Ashes triumph in 2009, providing momentum-shifting cameos at No. 6 in the order, and pulling off a series of impressive catches and stumpings. He bettered that effort on the subsequent tour of Australia in 2010-11, claiming 23 catches in the series including an Ashes-record-equalling six in the first innings at Melbourne, and concluded the series with his first hundred against Australia, at Sydney. He made 271 runs at 67.75 during England's 4-0 home triumph against India the following summer as both he and England, who went to No. 1 in the Test rankings, reached a career high.  Fielders standing around point were likely to be under assault if a bowler gave him any width outside off stump.

Having made an immediate impression at Sussex, Jordan was picked for England in late 2013 and seemed at home at international level during a run in the limited-overs sides over the winter, leading to his elevation to five-day cricket with a Test debut against Sri Lanka at Lord's at the start of England's 2014 summer.  \n"", 'Four cheap wickets to round up India for 94 in an innings win at The Oval brought a contented finish to an inconsistent summer where he showed glimpses of great potential, an attacking bowling style backed up by some belligerent bursts with the bat down the order and slick fielding. That display, plus an excellent all-round performance on his home ground in Bridgetown against West Indies in a Twenty20 international and his five-wicket demolition of Sri Lanka in an ODI at Old Trafford were other highlights. Yet at times things went awry as his method seemed to desert him, such as in a malfunctioning ODI spell against India in Cardiff.

He went back to Barbados, with the question looming of who he might play for internationally, and excelled again. ', 'A move to Sussex in 2013 saw his true potential come to the fore.

He charged into the wicket, took off at the crease like a less athletic Imran Khan, and, when he resisted the temptation to pitch short, got the ball to swing away from the right-hander. He was a combative batsman in the Dominic Cork mould - but with more shots, particularly off the back foot. Irani muscled his way into the Test team in 1996 against India, and, after helping save the Lord's Test, was dispassionately axed. He went on tour in 1996-97 but had to wait until 1999 for his next - and most recent - Test cap. But at county level Irani is a huge presence, and after an immense start to the 2002 season, he earned a recall to the England one-day side. He struggled in Australia the following winter - one local scribe wondered if he was a Barmy Army member who had got on the wrong bus - but still won a\nplace in the squad for the 2003 World Cup. He played two matches during the tournament and subsequently lost his place. Things then got worse when a long-term knee problem came to a head and, despite trips to a knee specialist in Germany, he was forced to give up bowling during the 2003 domestic season and concentrate on his batting. After Graham Gooch stepped down as the club's head coach prior to the start of the 2005 season, Irani assumed these responsibilities in addition to his role as county captain and flourished in both roles. In 2006 he averaged 59 in the Championship and began 2007 with a career-best 218.

Rather than slipping out of the game, he rediscovered his pace and ambition in one of English cricket's story-book recoveries. England, pummelled by the Australian Mitchell Johnson, and eager to find an out-and-out quick bowler of their own, liked what they saw during a Lions recall, and he played the four Tests of the 2014 summer as a shock trooper - two each against Sri Lanka and India - before succumbing to injury.  \n"", ""Plunkett's return was not entirely untroubled; at times his control deserted him and his around-the-wicket approach did not always drum up the anticipated menace. But he stayed true to the exhortations of Yorkshire's coach, Jason Gillespie, to keep it simple and just bowl fast and he took 18 wickets in four Tests, with his match figures of nine for 176 against Sri Lanka on his adopted home ground of Headingley the highlight, a feat overshadowed by Sri Lanka's last-over win. Sternly bearded, with an upright style and strikingly gym-honed upper body, he regularly exceeded speeds of 90mph, but England seemed to conclude that subtlety and control was missing and thereafter chose to utilise him exclusively in white-ball cricket."", ""Plunkett's initial selection for England's tour of Pakistan and India in 2005-06 represented the culmination of a two-year rise to prominence.  A bustling fast-medium seamer blessed with an ability to bowl an occasional unplayable ball and a powerful striker down the order, he briefly promised to have a lengthy international career only for issues with his control - and, in his final season at Durham in 2012, a loss of confidence in his action - to lower his sights."", 'Having made his first-class debut for Durham in 2003, Plunkett took on immediate responsibilities in the absence of Steve Harmison and the injured Mark Davies, and in 2005 took 50 wickets in a season for the first time. He made his Test debut in a thumping England defeat against Pakistan in Lahore, following the withdrawal of Simon Jones with an ankle injury, and announced himself as a capable allrounder with a composed half-century in only his second ODI against the same opposition. ', ""He was selected for England's Ashes campaign in Australia in 2006-7 and for seven gruelling weeks he was the forgotten man of a dismal Test tour. But as England, against all predictions, regrouped to win the one-day series, he seized his opportunity to impress with 12 wickets in the one-day series, including 3 for 43 in the decisive second final against Australia. It was a performance that secured his World Cup passage, though he only played three games and lacked the incisiveness he had shown in Australia."", ""A lack of England engagements freed Plunkett up for his Durham duties, and in 2007 he played a role in their first domestic trophy triumph, in their sixteenth year of first-class status, taking three wickets as Durham won the rain-interrupted Friends Provident final by 125 runs at Lord's. A regular in England Lions squads, Plunkett spent a winter as the Dolphins' overseas player in South Africa in 2007-08 and shared in Durham's Championship success the following summer. Durham retained the title in 2009 and Plunkett was at the forefront of their success with 49 wickets in the season, including match figures of 9 for 149 in the innings win over Nottinghamshire that sealed the title."", ""Plunkett looked set for a second crack at international cricket when he was named in England's squad for their Test series against South Africa in 2009-10, but he was overtaken by the likes of Graham Onions, his Durham team mate, Stuart Broad and Ajmal Shahzad in the fast-bowling ranks and has had to be content with sporadic appearances since. "", 'Subsequently, a combination of injuries and problems with his action saw Plunkett slip down the pecking order at Durham and after two lean seasons, amounting to three Championship appearances, he was told he could look for a new county. Yorkshire took the opportunity to offer him a three-year contract, enabling him to team up again with his former Durham coach, Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket at Headingley, who like Gillespie proved a positive influence. He immediately showed signs of a resurgence, taking 36 wickets in 12 Championship matches. Yorkshire capped him.

6 ft 4 in ",,Top-order batsman,Right-hand bat,Right-arm offbreak,,,,"[""\nFew cricketers have divided opinion like Kevin Pietersen. When he was unceremoniously dumped from England's set up early in 2014, with lawyers at the ready on all sides, he was presented by those in authority as an egotistical individualist whose reluctance to respect those in charge forever undermined attempts to build a strong team ethic. Whatever view you held, Pietersen deserved to be recognised as one of the most captivating cricketers to pull on an England shirt. His flamboyant strokeplay was at the heart of many of England's finest performances for a decade. A brazen belief in his own ability, moments of outrageous unorthodoxy and, at times, a surprising vulnerability on and off the field have all combined to give him great box-office appeal.  \n"", ""His 8,181 Test runs at 47.28 in 104 Tests had few rivals in England's history and his record in limited-overs cricket was also outstanding. In 2013, he became the highest England run-scorer in all international forms of the game combined. But Pietersen's ability to command attention on the field has been matched only by his ability to divide opinion off it. After more than nine years and many controversies, Pietersen's England career was at an end, a fact he wrestled with interminably: accepting it one day, holding out hope of a miraculous return the next. He had no choice but to commit himself to the life of a T20 specialist."", 'For many England cricket fans, no name sparks more excitement. But his celebrity status, individualistic streak and outspoken ways often grated with the England cricket authorities who prefer their star names to be more malleable and conservative. The English media, which has at times been vitriolic - not to say personal - about his rebellious streak has generally recognised that he has few peers.', 'An attempt to introduce him into the inner sanctum, by appointing him England captain in August 2008, lasted only five months as his relationship with the coach, Peter Moores, was uncomfortable from the outset. Their differences simmered throughout a troubled tour of India and when the rift became public Pietersen was forced to resign early in the New Year with a disenchanted Moores sacked on the same day. ', ""Another dispute arose in May 2012 when Pietersen, agitating for the freedom to play for longer in the Indian Premier League - where his popularity was unquestioned - briefly announced his retirement from all forms of limited-overs international cricket. Pietersen's frustration had a disruptive effect on England's summer Test series against South Africa. The ECB regarded the matter as an unacceptable display of player power. He was dropped for the final Test at The Oval and omitted from World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, England predictable struggling in his absence."", ""Pietersen was born in Pietermaritzburg to an Afrikaner father, Jannie, and an English mother, Penny, and abandoned South Africa cricket as a teenager in protest against the racial quota system which he felt was unfairly restricting his opportunities at KwaZulu Natal. He joined Nottinghamshire in 2000, attracted by the chance to work with Clive Rice, the county's coach and a former South Africa allrounder, but left at the end of the 2003 season after Nottinghamshire were relegated, unhappy with the standard of the Trent Bridge pitches and expressed his feelings strongly enough for the captain, Jason Gallian, to fling his kit out of the dressing room window. He signed for Hampshire, where he remained until 2010, at which point he decamped to Surrey to be close to his Chelsea home, but by then his county appearances had long become sporadic."", 'His England career began in a low-key one-day series in Zimbabwe in 2004 when Andrew Flintoff was ""rested"" after expressing moral misgivings about the political regime of Robert Mugabe. Pietersen averaged 104 in England\'s 4-0 victory. A subsequent tour of South Africa was more daunting, but he produced three audacious centuries in the series, his unbeaten 100 in 69 balls becoming England\'s quickest ODI hundred. He went on to reach 1000 one-day runs in just 21 innings - equalling Viv Richards\' record. ', ""Test cricket beckoned with the 2005 Ashes the following summer: Pietersen's selection ahead of Graham Thorpe representing the toughest selectorial decision of early summer. He sealed the return of the urn after 17 years with a stroke-filled 158 at The Oval on the final day of the series. England needed to avoid defeat to regain the Ashes and Pietersen was dropped three times on the way to 60, but tension gave way to scenes of jubilation as his adrenalin-charged climax included seven sixes, breaking Ian Botham's record for England in an Ashes Test. He was named man of the match, finished an uneven series as top scorer, with 473 runs at 52.55 and, like the rest of the side, was awarded an MBE amid an atmosphere of national jubilation. He was also named as one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year."", ""The subsequent years were a whirl of exciting innings, occasional rash dismissals and celebrity engagements. Sri Lanka's visit to England in 2006 was a high point. He matched his highest Test score of 158 in the first Test and in the following Test at Edgbaston, to general incredulity he unveiled the Switch Hit as he reversed his stance to slog-sweep Muttiah Muralitharan for six. There was no more appropriate way for a player of Pietersen's razzamatazz to become the first batsman since Graham Gooch in 1990 to score a century in three successive Test innings in England. The MCC ruled in 2008 that the shot was legal. He was up for the challenge, too, in Australia in 2006-7, averaging more than 50, and in the World Cup which followed, but England were a ramshackle lot as Flintoff, the captain, and coach Duncan Fletcher rarely had a meeting of minds. "", ""Soon it was time for his ill-fated tilt at the England captaincy. His tenure officially began when Michael Vaughan, the Test captain, retired and Paul Collingwood stood down as ODI captain at the same time. Pietersen started with a century and victory against South Africa at The Oval but that was perhaps as close as he ever got to acceptance from the establishment. England's ODI series against India ended prematurely because of terrorist attacks on Mumbai, but England returned to fulfil the Test tour amid unprecedented security as Pietersen expressed the need not to be cowed by terrorism. But behind the scenes Pietersen's relationship was deteriorating with Moores, a coach with no international experience and an unrelenting work ethic. Pietersen recommended, rather too publicly, that Moores be removed and got his way, only to be summarily sacked as well. His relationship with the ECB never entirely recovered. Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower, who took over as captain and coach, had much healing to undertake."", ""Alongside brushes with management - a feature in all the teams he has played for - injuries have interrupted him at key moments. His 2009 Ashes campaign was cut short by leg trouble that needed surgery and he left the 2011 World Cup with a hernia. His form became mercurial rather than reliable and he seemed to develop a curious fallibility against a succession of left-arm spinners, some more renowned than others. But he ended a 20-month wait for an international century by making a career-best 227 as England won the Ashes in Australia for the first time in 24 years, then scored 533 runs at 106.60 in England's 4-0 home whitewashing of India that secured them the No.1 ranking in Tests. His reputation as one of England's greats could no longer be denied."", ""He was also the Man of the Tournament in England's World Twenty20 win in 2010 but his one-day batting tailed off, with no centuries over a three-year period between 2009 and 2011. He scored two in successive innings against Pakistan in 2012 - including his highest ODI score of 130 - and, briefly, it appeared they would be his last innings in coloured kit for England when he announced his retirement from limited-overs internationals, briefly seduced by the attractions of IPL. "", 'England\'s Test against South Africa at Headingley in 2012 captured his career in microcosm. His power struggle with the ECB had left him moody and unpredictable before the Test, but when the match began he struck a quite brilliant 149 and, in the process, became the fastest man in terms of time, to reach 7,000 Test runs. That was quickly followed by more off-field drama, as reports of derogatory text messages about his captain, Strauss, to South Africa players, filled the media. Pietersen was dropped for the next Test at Lord\'s and, even though he did an about turn and reconfirmed his desire to play for England in all formats, forgiveness did not come quickly enough for him to play in World Twenty20. When he was officially invited back into the ranks, in Colombo, he had to sit next to the ECB chairman, Giles Clarke, as details of his ""reintegration process"" were sternly issued.  His response was to bat as well as ever. His 186 in Mumbai was a jewel in England\'s crown as they won a Test series in India for the first time in 28 years.', 'The detente was short-lived, however, as cracks reappeared on England\'s disastrous 2013-14 tour of Australia where, despite being the leading run-scorer - a modest achievement in the circumstances - rumours surfaced of a further deterioration in his relationship with Flower. Although Flower himself resigned, the ECB decided to cut its losses a few days later and summarily brought down the curtain on Pietersen\'s England career as well, citing a need to rebuilt ""team ethic and philosophy"". An autobiography published later that year was arguably the most outspoken in cricket history as he launched an emotional attack on those he felt had wronged him. It was a desperately sad end.\n', '\n']","['ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2005', 'ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2006']",104.0,181,8,8181.0,227,47.28,13255,61.72,23,35,985,81,62.0,0.0,136.0,125,16,4440.0,130,40.73,5128,86.58,9,25,427,77,40.0,0.0,37.0,36,5,1176.0,79,37.93,831,141.51,0,7,119,32,14.0,0.0,217.0,358,26,16522,355*,49.76,,,50,71,,,152,0,253.0,233,34,8112,147,40.76,,,15,46,,,85,0,200.0,193,25,5695,115*,33.89,4160,136.89,3,35,495,220,66,0,104.0,58,1311,886,10.0,3/52,4/78,88.6,4.05,131.1,0,0,0,136.0,23,400,370,7.0,2/22,2/22,52.85,5.55,57.1,0,0,0,37.0,3,30,53,1.0,1/27,1/27,53.00,10.6,30.0,0,0,0,217.0,,6443,3760,73,4/31,,51.50,3.50,88.2,,0,0,253.0,,2390,2122,41,3/14,3/14,51.75,5.32,58.2,0,0,0,200.0,30,396,534,17,3/33,3/33,31.41,8.09,23.2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He had several opportunities to make his mark for England, especially in limited-overs cricket, without ever quite holding down a regular place. Six Tests without much of an impact and 36 ODIs with an average of 32, and excellent strike rate of 95, but only one half-century, told of a player whose consistency had not been adorned by big, eye-catching contributions.  \n', 'Patel has been involved in a permanent attempt to persuade England that his fitness levels are acceptable but he has never entirely managed it, not helped by the fact that the left-arm slows that made him an especially tempting option in Asia turned out to lack the guile to trouble the best players. ', ""His early career was full of promise. He represented England at Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 levels, and was awarded the Test Match Special Young Cricketer of the Year award in 2000 for his impressive performances in the Under-15 World Cup. He made his debut for Nottinghamshire 2nd XI at the age of just 14, in late 1999 but it wasn't until 2006 that he finally began to show signs of realising his potential, scoring 156 not out against Middlesex, an innings in which he went from 100 to 150 in just 17 balls."", ""Some of his most eye-catching performances came in Twenty20, including a unique double-wicket maiden against Derbyshire in 2006, but it was in 50-over cricket that he first attracted the interest of England's selectors, who picked him in his first international squad for the 2008 Champions Trophy. "", 'Patel impressed during his breakthrough season in 2008 where he played 11 ODIs in 2008, particularly during a haul of 5 for 41 to beat South Africa at The Oval. But instead of kicking on to greater things, his career stagnated, amid repeated failures to respond to the cajoling of the England management, and get into the gym to sort out his waistline. The county circuit did not lack for stories about accidents on treadmills or his penchant for chocolate bars', 'England\'s frustration was at its height ahead of the 2011 World Cup in the subcontinent. England desperately wanted to be able to include him for the slow, low wickets of India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and named him in their 30-man provisional squad, with the expectation that he would respond accordingly. ""All we were saying was \'get into reasonable shape\'. It didn\'t have to be perfect,"" said England\'s coach, Andy Flower.', 'That public rollicking appeared, finally, to have made the penny drop. Patel worked hard enough at his fitness before the 2011 season to have reached the basic targets laid out by England and he was rewarded with a recall to the limited-overs set-up after a strong start to the summer with Nottinghamshire, his first involvement for two-and-a-half years.', ""His work paid off as he passed 1,000 runs in a season for the first time and took 33 wickets for Nottinghamshire. He was one of few players to come out of England's ill-fated one-day tour of India in credit with 160 runs 40.00."", ""Patel was an England regular in limited-overs cricket when he earned a first Test call up for England's tour of Sri Lanka in March 2012.  Despite a modest domestic season in which he passed 50 only three times in first-class matches and had a top score of only 69, he was also selected for England's 2012-13 tour of India, where he made his first century in a senior England side in a warm-up match against India A and was selected for the first three Tests without ever making an impact. He then failed to win selection for World Twenty20 in Bangladesh shortly after predicting that, at 29, he was approaching his peak and had ambitions to play 200 times for England. Instead, he feared that total might end on 60.."", 'His slow left-arm was never more valuable for Notts than when a spell of 3 for 21 from seven overs helped Nottinghamshire beat Glamorgan by 87 runs in the 2013 YB40 final at Lord\'s to win their first limited-overs trophy for more than 20 years. But England\'s declining interest - even with his director of cricket Mick Newell now ensconced as a selector - began to weigh on him. With his Test ambitions high at the start of 2014, he averaged 52, only to average 23 after he failed be selected. Newell himself called that ""no coincidence"".', ""That run shortage continued in 2015, only for him to win a surprise call-up as England's third spinner for a Test series against Pakistan in the UAE, his chance coming when Zafar Ansari was injured in the field hours after being selected. Patel got his chance in the final Test, a victory for Pakistan which sealed the series, leaving the media - and the ECB - to agonise over discouraging conditions for English spinners in county cricket."", 'Never mind: in the county game, his best was yet to come. Patel was at the forefront of Nottinghamshire\'s excellent season in 2017 in which they regained their First Division place in the Championship at the first attempt and won both limited-overs trophies. His unbeaten 122 against Essex at Chelmsford as Notts pulled off a record 50-over chase in the semi-final was not just a fine innings but wonderful theatre. He took the man-of-the-match award in the T20 final at Edgbaston for his 64 off 42 balls against Birmingham Bears, completing his second run-out of Finals Day for added theatre. He then bemoaned - as was his habit - that England\'s selectors had not been in touch. Patel won both the PCA\'s Most Valuable Player award and the Players\' Player award - the first recognition for a Notts player since Richard Hadlee 30 years earlier.

Graeme Swann made his England debut as a raw 20-year-old in 2000, in a nondescript one-day international in Bloemfontein, but it was a brief foray into the top level. Eight years later, having learnt his trade on the county scene with Northamptonshire and then Nottinghamshire, his Test debut came against India, at Chennai, and from that point he never looked back, becoming one of England's greatest spinners. \n"", ""In 60 Tests, he took 255 wickets at a touch under 30 runs apiece in a little more than five years, prolific wicket-taking exceeding anyone else in Test cricket in that period, with James  Anderson (232), Stuart Broad (207) and Dale Steyn (205) behind him. He retired as England's sixth highest wicket-taker, the leading offspinner and second among all England slow bowlers only to Derek Underwood, who took 297 wickets. He was wonderfully adaptable: attuned when necessary to a defensive role to allow the quicks in England's four-strong attack time to rest, and also blessed with the ability to dip and turn the ball markedly. He was also one of England's great character cricketers, refreshingly individualistic on and off the field, bringing fun wherever he played. He was a fine slip fielder, too, although the hours spent in the field, and the training grind necessary to achieve peak physical fitness, did not always some naturally to him."", ""As the new millennium dawned, there was a fear that traditional offspinners were becoming defunct at the highest level. Swann was one of a special band who challenged the notion. He did not have a doosra, but he had cunning, flight and turn. He was also helped by a striking number of left-handed batsmen at the highest levels and a growing use of technology which made it more likely that umpires would uphold lbw appeals. Of his 255 wickets, 70 were lbw, compared to Laker's 32 from 193; 121 of his victims were left-handers whereas Laker only returned 32. When he retired, he felt irreplaceable."", ""His debut at Chennai was marked by two wickets in his first over - the knack of striking in his first over would be a skill that stayed with him - and within a few months he had usurped Monty Panesar as England's premier spinner, a position he would not relinquish. Swann loved a wise-crack (his 2010-11 Ashes video diary became an internet hit) - a trait that did not endear him to all early in his career - but it would be unfair merely to brand him as a dressing-room joker. He was the ultimate competitor on the field, often bordering on feisty, and a master of his craft. His record showed the value of developing at domestic level and the fact he was pulled out of the international game as a youngster, almost as quickly as he was handed his chance, with the severe England coach at the time, Duncan Fletcher, not alone in regarding him as somewhat immature, perhaps saved him from being overwhelmed before he was ready."", ""After biding his time on the domestic circuit, he soon became a matchwinner at Test level and a key part of both the one-day side and Twenty20 sides. After a successful tour of West Indies (albeit in a losing cause) he played a key role in the 2009 Ashes victories at Lord's and The Oval. Further incisive spells followed over the years to come: South Africa in Durban, Bangladesh in Chittagong, Pakistan at Edgbaston and Lord's, Australia in Adelaide, Sri Lanka in Cardiff, India at The Oval, Sri Lanka in Colombo."", ""During the 2012 home season, Swann's career hit a blip. The snap and spark in his bowling disappeared for a time as he was superbly played by Hashim Amla. For only the second time in his Test career he was dropped: the Test at Headingley became infamous for a text-message furore which engulfed Kevin Pietersen. However, the following winter Swann was back to being a central figure, helping England to an historic series win in India, his alliance with Monty Panesar as they claimed 19 of the 20 wickets to fall representing one of the greatest spin-bowling double acts in England's Test history. "", ' dubbed them ""the dust devils"".', ""A recurrence of a long-standing elbow problem, which he has been forced to manage throughout his career, meant he required surgery in early 2013 and England were forced to contemplate life without Swann. He was back for that summer's Ashes, and took 26 wickets without ever being at his best, but he would not last the return series in Australia. The third Test in Perth proved to be his last. The last ball bowled he bowled in Test cricket flew deep into the Prindiville Stand at wide long-on; his final over went for 22, all to the whirring blade of Shane Watson. Seven wickets at 80 in the series, as he failed to get enough revolutions on the ball to remain a threat, represented an unhappy end."", 'With the Ashes lost after three Tests, Swann announced his retirement four days before the Boxing Day Test.  A tour which had started with such promise for England was by then in disarray: Jonathan Trott, the long-serving No 3, had already departed with a stress-related illness.

With his black patka, wide eyes and eager (if a touch hapless) fielding, he rapidly became a fan favourite.  \n', 'After years of limited and negative England spinners, Panesar was a revelation. His languid action deeply excited England supporters and even on the occasions when sharp turn was not forthcoming that was belied by an effervescence apparent in his cherubic and unconfined celebrations at the fall of each and every wicket. Like a lamb let loose from the paddock, he cut a joyful figure. ', 'For a time, he was considered the saviour of English spin bowling, but that position was usurped by the emergence of his old Northants colleague Graeme Swann, who had greater command of spin and dip on flat surfaces and who also had a shrewdness about him which Panesar occasionally seemed to lack. They combined in spectacular fashion, however, in Mumbai in November 2012, dubbed the ""dust devils"" as they returned joint figures of 19 for 323, in one of the greatest England spin double acts in history, only the fourth occasion that England spinners had combined to take 19 wickets or more wickets in a Test and the first time for 54 years.', ""When Swann retired midway through England's Ashes debacle in 2013-14, debilitated by elbow trouble, Panesar should have been ready to step in. But his career was by then in question. He left Sussex under a cloud in 2013 after urinating from on high upon a nightclub bouncer in the early hours of the morning, and his behaviour on long tours had its eccentric moments. He joined Essex, with his many fans hoping that it would revive a faltering career, but despite respectable returns in his first full season at Chelmsford the rise of Moeen Ali looked to have consigned his England days to the past."", ""A Luton lad by birth he progressed through Northamptonshire's youth teams and was picked for England Under-19s in 2000. He marked his first-class debut a year later against Leicestershire with a match haul of 8 for 131. Opportunities thereafter were limited but a fine 2005 season kick-started his career. He took 46 Championship wickets at 21.54, and spent part of the winter at the Darren Lehmann Academy in Adelaide. That was enough for Panesar to be picked for England's 2006 tour of India in February. He made his Test debut at Nagpur picking up his boyhood hero, Sachin Tendulkar, as his first Test wicket and Rahul Dravid as his third."", ""The following summer, against Pakistan, Panesar attracted national headlines, even beyond the game, by spinning England to a series win. At Old Trafford he made the most of a helpful surface with eight wickets then, at Headingley, he was England's best bowler on a run-filled strip. The loop, guile and changes of pace outfoxed Pakistan's top-order, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf and Younis Khan."", ""In a matter of months he had elevated himself to the position of England's senior spinner, pushing aside Ashley Giles. Yet Duncan Fletcher - ever the loyalist, rarely the risk-taker - preferred a rusty Giles for the first two Tests of the 2006-07 Ashes. England were thrashed in both but Monty got a chance in the third at Perth, becoming the first English spinner to take five at the WACA (and eight in the match). As England crashed to a humiliating 5-0 defeat, Panesar was one of the precious few to return home with their reputation intact."", ""He started the 2007 summer with 23 wickets in four Tests against West Indies, which brought a career-high No. 6 ranking, but things began to go awry thereafter. He struggled in the following home series against India, and away in Sri Lanka, where he lost his confidence and misunderstood mutterings began about his lack of variety. Though he fared well in New Zealand a tough 2008 summer, where Graeme Smith swept him to distraction in South Africa's series-clinching win in Edgbaston, blunted his cheerful persona. "", ""He was comprehensively outperformed by a resurgent Swann during his return to India in December 2008, and again in the Caribbean, where he lost his position as England's No. 1 spinner. The bowling lacked spark but more significantly, so did the man. Lost in a confusion of 'expert' opinion around him, he lost faith in his method. That trend continued in the first Test of the 2009 Ashes at Cardiff, where he and Swann both underperformed with the ball, claiming one wicket between them. However, by batting through to the close in a remarkable tenth-wicket stand with James Anderson, Panesar reaffirmed his cult status. That was as good as the summer got for him though as his bowling form slumped and he lost his central contract. "", ""By the end of 2009 the future of Panesar's international career looked doubtful but he took control by leaving his life-long county Northamptonshire and moving to Sussex. Trusted to set his fields and take a senior role in the dressing room he rediscovered his vim. A strong 2010 season saw a return to the England squad for the Ashes win. On the 2012 winter tour to UAE he finally got his chance for England again, picking up 14 wickets at 22 from his two Tests against Pakistan, but opportunities continued to be sporadic."", 'There followed a disturbing deterioration in both his professional and personal life. He was released by Sussex late in the 2013 season after urinating on high on a Brighton nightclub bouncer after he had been asked to leave. After a loan spell at Northants, it was Essex who gambled on him, but his form remained unconvincing and there were reports of unpredictable and difficult behaviour as he was left out of the side for long periods. By the time Essex also let him go, in September 2015, he had taken 67 wickets in 24 first-class games (all in Division Two) at 28.62 and  was back with his long-time mentor, Neil Burns, following a holistic approach to his career which emphasised personal and mental welfare alongside cricketing skills. It brought him a couple of matches for Northants in 2016 but no sign of regular cricket.\n', '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2001'],50.0,68,23,220.0,26,4.88,749,29.37,0,0,23,1,10.0,0.0,26.0,8,3,26.0,13,5.2,91,28.57,0,0,2,0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1.0,1,1.00,2,50.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,219.0,270,87,1536,46*,8.39,4315,35.59,0,0,,,44,0,85.0,29,13,141,17*,8.81,251,56.17,0,0,,,15,0,33.0,7,2,7,3*,1.40,15,46.66,0,0,0,0,3,0,50.0,85,12475,5797,167.0,6/37,11/210,34.71,2.78,74.7,4,12,2,26.0,26,1308,980,24.0,3/25,3/25,40.83,4.49,54.5,0,0,0,1.0,1,24,40,2.0,2/40,2/40,20.00,10.0,12.0,0,0,0,219.0,,48193,22135,709,7/60,,31.22,2.75,67.9,26,39,6,85.0,,3725,2892,83,5/20,5/20,34.84,4.65,44.8,0,1,0,33.0,32,648,816,27,3/14,3/14,30.22,7.55,24.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

5 ft 11 in ",,Opening batsman,Left-hand bat,Left-arm medium,,,,"[""\nUpstanding, self-effacing and privately educated, Andrew Strauss was the archetypical England captain, and one of their most successful ones. His understated authority underpinned England's rise to the top of the world rankings - for the first time in 31 years, according to back-dated calculations - in a journey that included a home Ashes win in 2009, an even sweeter victory in Australia for the first time since 1986-87, and a 4-0 whitewash to usurp No. 1-ranked India in 2011. \n"", 'A compact left-handed opener, Strauss was severe on the cut shot, efficient off his pads and workmanlike everywhere else. Though most comfortable with pace on the ball, Strauss made two centuries against an Australian attack that included Shane Warne in 2005 and tenacious back-to-back hundreds against India in Chennai in 2008. ', ""His early county cricket with Middlesex did not exactly suggest a star in the making, but a century in 2003 against Lancashire, with Andrew Flintoff haring in, set the selectors sniffing - and also made Strauss believe he had what it took. After a few one-day caps that winter, Strauss was called up for the first Test against New Zealand in 2004 after Michael Vaughan twisted his knee in the Lord's nets. Strauss responded with a confident century, and was on his way to another in the second innings when Nasser Hussain ran him out 17 short. But Hussain had seen enough: with Vaughan set to return, he announced his immediate retirement and Strauss's England career was set.  \t"", 'Strauss flirted with England captaincy in 2006 - dubbing himself ""the stand-in for the stand-in"" in the absence of the injured Vaughan and Flintoff -  and led England to victory at home against Pakistan. Universally admired by his team-mates, it now seems bizarre that a natural leader would ever be overlooked for the captaincy but that\'s exactly what happened for Ashes the following winter.  Flintoff was chosen instead as England flunked to 5-0 loss. It was the first disappointment in Strauss\'s Test career and instigated a slump in form that saw him go 15 matches without a Test hundred. With his England spot looking desperately insecure he produced a eight-hour 177, his highest Test score, to seal a series win in Napier and salvage his career. ', ""His form flooded back and when Kevin Pietersen - Vaughan's successor as captain - and coach Peter Moores fell out spectacularly, England turned to the steadiest pair of hands. He forged a partnership with new team director Andy Flower in 2009 and the 'Andocracy' has since reached almost hallowed status. "", 'During the early part of his England career hundreds came apace - with 10 in his first 30 games - but captaincy, as it so often does, dented his form. Despite centuries in the 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes, Strauss struggled elsewhere and when England lost four consecutive Tests in the 2011-12 winter, murmurings began about his future. But Strauss stayed true to himself - affable, calm and respectful - and began the 2012 season with two hundreds against West Indies to put him within touching distance of the most by an England batsman. However, soon after that, Strauss had a terrible both on and off the field against South Africa - England lost the series 2-0 and with it the number one ranking, Strauss scored 107 runs in six innings, and the Pietersen controversy went from bad to worse. A week after the end of that Test series, Strauss announced his retirement from all international cricket, having played 100 Tests, and having led England to victory in 24 out of 50 Tests in charge.']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005', 'Awarded the OBE in June 2011']",100.0,178,6,7037.0,177,40.91,14385,48.91,21,27,867,10,121.0,0.0,127.0,126,8,4205.0,158,35.63,5195,80.94,6,27,454,25,57.0,0.0,4.0,4,0,73.0,33,18.25,64,114.06,0,0,9,0,1.0,0.0,241.0,424,25,17046,241*,42.72,,,46,74,,,228,0,254.0,247,14,7631,163,32.75,,,10,49,,,90,0,28.0,28,0,519,60,18.53,442,117.42,0,2,73,3,12,0,100.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,1,6,3,0.0,-,-,32.91,3.00,-,0,0,0,4.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,241.0,,132,142,3,1/16,,47.33,6.45,44.0,,0,0,254.0,,6,3,0,-,-,-,3.00,-,0,0,0,28.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

And it's true that Ben Stokes' combative nature, allied to his powerful frame and outrageous talent, lifted a somewhat diffident England side to another level. Capable of turning games with his batting, his bowling and in the field - through his character as much as his deeds - Stokes soon attracted comparisons with Ian Botham. Expectations were huge. \n"", 'It is his misfortune therefore that he may be most remembered for two episodes he would rather forget. The first came in the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup final in Kolkata. Asked to defend 19 in the last over against West Indies, his attempted yorkers missed the mark by inches resulting in Carlos Brathwaite heaving him for four successive sixes into a sweltering night sky.', ""The second, and altogether more serious, incident occurred in September 2017. Celebrating an ODI victory in Bristol, Stokes became embroiled in a fight outside a club in the early hours of the morning that resulted in his arrest. A trial at Bristol Crown Court subsequently saw him cleared of the charge of affray but by then the reputational damage had been done. He had already missed the 2017-18 Ashes tour - a toothless England were beaten 4-0 with Stokes not considered for selection - and been stripped of the team's vice-captaincy. "", 'He could console himself with the knowledge that he had the time and the ability to ensure he was remembered for more positive reasons. Within months of his comeback, Stokes had played a key role in England\'s 3-0 Test win in Sri Lanka, their first whitewash series victory in Asia. Trevor Bayliss praised Stokes\' attitude as ""exemplary"", saying he had ""learned his lesson"". ', 'Stokes, from the moment he made his Durham debut, felt very much a product of the northeast of England. He was actually born in Christchurch, New Zealand and came from a rich sporting pedigree with his father, Ged, playing international Rugby League for that country.', 'His prodigious talent was clear from an early age. A true allrounder, Stokes debuted for Durham at 17 and dismissed Mark Ramprakash with his third legal delivery in senior cricket. He enjoyed a productive time at the 2009 Under-19 World Cup, scoring a century against India, before registering a maiden fifty on his first-class debut for Durham. But it was in 2011 that he really began to blossom. In April he took 6 for 68 and scored a brilliant hundred that included five sixes in an over, and a month later registered his maiden limited-overs ton. A broken finger hindered his bowling, but he played for England Lions and made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin, going on to play four times against India, albeit with limited impact.', ""A first brush with the management was to follow, after being called up to the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia in early 2013. Stokes ended up being sent home with three matches remaining, along with Kent's Matt Coles, after two breaches of discipline. It was a watershed moment, and he was rapidly rehabilitated back at Durham, playing a key role in their Championship-winning season and being recalled to England's limited-overs teams. He took a maiden ODI five-for and won selection for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, a return to Australia that would command attention for the right reasons."", ""Stokes' performances were a rare bright spot on a disastrous trip. When the agony was all over, only Stokes returned to England as a star on the rise. Brought into the XI at Adelaide, after Jonathan Trott's untimely departure, his pugnacious nature came to the fore during a maiden Test hundred in Perth, a doughty response out of keeping with England's general demeanour throughout the tour."", 'But with fire came combustibility. Stokes missed the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh after reacting to a dismissal in Barbados by punching a dressing room locker and sustaining a broken wrist. During a difficult year, he was dropped from the Test team after making three ducks in a row against India, and then lost his one-day place on the tour of Sri Lanka - ultimately missing out on selection for the 2015 World Cup.', ""Stokes, like England after a dismal tournament, needed rejuvenating. It began with the Lord's Test against New Zealand, when Stokes scored 92 and 101 after being promoted to bat at No. 6. A successful Ashes followed and he was also a central figure in the new-look ODI side that began to put the World Cup behind them under the guidance of Bayliss and Paul Farbrace. A few months later he produced a barnstorming 258 from 198 balls against South Africa in Cape Town - the fastest England double-hundred in history and the second fastest of all time - during a stand of 399 with Jonny Bairstow."", ""Following his Kolkata nightmare, he nevertheless grew in stature within the side and was promoted to the vice-captaincy (at least until the Bristol episode). He scored his maiden ODI hundred in Dhaka in late 2016 and added four more across international formats the following year, while also taking Test-best figures of 6 for 22 against West Indies at Lord's, becoming a key cog for England despite a chequered injury record."", 'An IPL millionaire twice over - he was bought for £1.7m by Rising Pune Supergiant in 2017, winning tournament MVP, and then picked up for £1.4m the following season by Rajasthan Royals - Stokes was one of the most talked-about players in the world. But there was a sense the best was yet to come. Going into 2019, a year containing an Ashes series and a World Cup, he looked to be a player at the peak of his powers who had finally understood the level of sacrifice and discipline required to coax the best out of his undoubted talent.

For Roy, a Surrey opener of dashing disposition, such a change of emphasis was ideal. His maiden ODI ton had come before the World Cup, against Pakistan in Dubai, but it was in 2016 under the leadership of Eoin Morgan, adamant that England must play free-spirited cricket, that Roy found his voice, making two ODI hundreds against Sri Lanka in England, the second of them - a career-best 162, the second highest ODI score made at the time by an England batsman - coming in front of his adoring home crowd at The Oval. \n"", ""There was even better to come. In banishing the blues of an Ashes Test thrashing in 2017-18, Roy surpassed Alex Hales' record one-day score for England of 171 with 180 in Melbourne as Australia recognised an England one-day side performing with a freedom of expression that surpassed anything they could muster in response. This was far removed from the batsman who had endured such a dud season in Australia's Big Bash competition."", ""Born in South Africa, Roy came to the UK aged 10 and soon started to move through the system. He was a hugely successful schoolboy cricketer for Whitgift, and made his Surrey debut as a 17-year-old in 2008 during the Twenty20 Cup and his fielding talents were noticed by England, who used him as a sub later that summer against South Africa. It wasn't until 2010 that he broke into the first team again. He promptly thumped 101 off 57 balls against Kent at Beckenham, Surrey's first T20 hundred. Later in the summer he struck an unbeaten 76 from 65 balls against Leicestershire on Championship debut. England's selectors gave him a place on the Performance Programme tour to India before the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka in early 2012."", ""Roy's obvious ability in the shorter formats led to him twice winning T20 contracts in the Bangladesh Premier League but he struggled to build on a quietly impressive role in Surrey's 2011 promotion campaign, when he made his maiden first-class hundred. In 2013, he made two YB40 centuries - doubling his List A tally - but struggled badly in Championship cricket, scoring just 49 runs in seven innings."", ""It was in 2014 that Roy made the leap from a prodigiously talented but erratic young cricketer to a consistent match-winner. The transformation was particularly evident in the NatWest T20 Blast, where he struck 677 runs at 48.35 apiece - the highest tally in the competition. England's T20 competition had undeniably produced an exciting batsman of international quality. Roy's uncomplicated clean-striking became as much a feature of Friday nights at The Oval as the beer-snakes and streakers. With his breathtaking power down the ground and penchant for switch-hitting - not to mention the fact he was born in South Africa - he was frequently compared to Kevin Pietersen, not least by Pietersen himself. His brilliance did not achieve the same levels in the following two summers - how could it? - but a destructive hundred against Somerset in 2015, and against Kent the following year, was a reminder of his unfettered talent."", 'After working hard on pacing his innings in four-day cricket, Roy also blossomed in Championship cricket in 2014, hitting 1078 runs, the highest at the club, at an average of 50-plus without reigning in his destructiveness: his strike rate was still 84. He also averaged 47.65 in the Championship in a promotion year in 2015, his strike rate even higher.  ', ""By the summer's end, he was rewarded with a T20 international debut against India and in 2015 he became a fixture in England's limited-overs formats, building on a couple of promising 60s against Australia with a maiden ODI ton against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, an innings that was rarely fluent - and that was entirely overshadowed by Jos Buttler's dash to his own hundred in record time - but one that provided proof of a growing survival mentality."", 'Kevin Pietersen, a former Surrey team-mate as well as also sharing a South African birthplace, called for Roy to bat at No 6 for England in Tests the following summer, saying it would make England fans ""so happy"". Although Pietersen seemed oblivious to it, Roy\'s international form had faltered. He had failed to pass 20 in nine ODI innings and was eventually dropped from England\'s Champions Trophy side, but his form rebounded with 84 and 96 in late-September ODIs against West Indies.  ', 'Those crowd-pleasing innings came along less often than England would have hoped, keeping his average not far above 30, but when they came they were spectacular, communicating the devil-may-care approach of an exciting England side that found itself top of the ODI rankings a year or so before contesting the World Cup on home soil. As well as the Melbourne 180 (which also included a record-breaking 221 stand for the third wicket with Joe Root), there were further hundreds against Australia in Cardiff and Chester-le-Street, often accompanied by the plaintiff - and ignored - cry from Pietersen that his imagined protégé should win a chance at Test level.', '\n']",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,73.0,71,2,2661.0,180,38.56,2522,105.51,7,12,314,45,29.0,0.0,32.0,32,0,743.0,78,23.21,512,145.11,0,4,75,35,5.0,0.0,81.0,132,11,4645,143,38.38,5657,82.11,9,22,618,72,73.0,0.0,166.0,159,7,5658,180,37.22,5309,106.57,14,28,685,96,66.0,0.0,192.0,188,9,4882,122*,27.27,3349,145.77,4,31,531,193,83.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,73.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,32.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,81.0,25,712,495,14,3/9,4/47,35.35,4.17,50.8,0,0,0,166.0,1,6,12,0,-,-,-,12.00,-,0,0,0,192.0,2,18,39,1,1/23,1/23,39.00,13.00,18.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Small, a last-minute replacement, stunned a Boxing Day crowd of 58,000 at the MCG by splitting Australia's first innings wickets with Ian Botham. Small took 5 for 48 and Australia were rolled over for 141. When England won, Small was named Man of the Match, as much for his enthusiasm as anything: he was always a whole-hearted tryer, a committed team man and a delightful guy. Australia's discomfiture was increased by Small's strange build: seemingly without a neck, he walked around as though he still had a coathanger inside his jacket. He came to England from Barbados just after his 14th birthday, the cut-off date for automatic qualification. However, the combination of his looks and his then-pair of nerdish specs made the Lord's registration committee think he had no chance of ever playing Test cricket anyway, so they let him through. In good times, Small might not have played for England; he was neither especially fast nor reliable, and early in his career was an infuriatingly regular no-baller. But he cut his run right down and settled for being predominately an outswing bowler, still hostile enough to worry even the best batsmen, as Australia found again a week after the MCG, when he whipped through the middle order in Sydney. Like most players of that era, he then drifted in and out of the England side but took eight wickets in the defeat at Bridgetown in 1989-90 and was still a key figure for Warwickshire in their all-conquering year of 1994.\n"", ' \n']",[],17.0,24,7,263.0,59,15.47,601,43.76,0,1,31,0,9.0,0.0,53.0,24,9,98.0,18*,6.53,188,52.12,0,0,7,,7.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,315.0,404,97,4409,70,14.36,,,0,7,,,95.0,0.0,390.0,191,65,1072,40*,8.50,,,0,0,,,74.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17.0,31,3927,1871,55.0,5/48,8/183,34.01,2.85,71.4,4,2,0,53.0,53,2793,1942,58.0,4/31,4/31,33.48,4.17,48.1,1,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,315.0,,49567,24392,852,7/15,,28.62,2.95,58.1,,29,2,390.0,,18434,12230,462,5/18,5/18,26.47,3.98,39.9,9,5,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

The accolade everybody anticipated became his three years later, when Alastair Cook stood down after the 2016-17 tour of India. It was understandable that there were a few fears for Root's future workload. He was rare among England batsmen in achieving maturity so quickly, and had looked consumed by the delights of batting from the moment he first took guard. Now he had new responsibilities.  \n"", ""Slight of build, perky of shot and with a scampish grin that got under a bowler's skin, by the time Root was appointed Test captain he had rattled up 53 Tests within five years with an average top side of 50, comfortably the highest among contemporary England players. Early expectations that he would establish himself as an opener did not materialise as an expansive game increasingly seemed better suited to No. 3 or No. 4. He was equally influential in limited-overs cricket where England's commitment to fearless cricket after their 2015 World Cup was much to his tastes, his crispness of stroke and shrewd judgment enabling him to bat purposefully around batsmen of greater weight of shot."", ""Root had never been a strikingly heavy scorer as he worked through the ranks, nor was he particularly athletic, but his systematic approach was that of a young batsman who would not sell his wicket easily and gave England hope that he would be able to attune his game to the highest level. A slender batsman reliant on precision, his patience and stubbornness at the crease had Geoffrey Boycott gushing that he reminded him of himself, although Root soon developed a much broader range. Others saw some of his mentor Michael Vaughan in Root's front-foot drive - the pair also both attended Sheffield Collegiate."", ""Root's Test debut for England in Nagpur in 2012 exemplified the qualities which had attracted coaches from an early age. Picked to tour India on the strength of two encouraging seasons with Yorkshire - and having been named Cricket Writers' Club Young Player of the Year - he impressed enough to be selected for the final Test of the series. He began with England's sixth-longest debut innings in terms of balls faced, scoring 73 from 229 balls as he displayed the patience and discrimination demanded both by the situation of the game and a desperately slow surface. "", ""His rise continued with a maiden Test hundred in his home ground, Headingley, against New Zealand in 2013 followed by a maiden Ashes century at Lord's having been promoted to open. Root looked set to occupy that role for many years to come, but his fortunes dipped as the series went on and then crashed along with the team as England were whitewashed in Australia in 2013-14. He began the tour at No. 6, moved up to No. 3 after the enforced departure of Jonathan Trott, then saw his Ashes ended early when he was dropped for the fifth Test in Sydney."", ""Proof of Root's ability came in the way he responded. Back in England, he followed up a two-tone double hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's - a disciplined innings with a freewheeling finale - with two more big hundreds against India. All three had the not-out asterisk. That seemed to say a lot about him."", 'He even had the fortune to skipper Yorkshire to the Championship title at Trent Bridge in 2014 when Andrew Gale was suspended, less than a fortnight after he became the first Yorkshire batsman to hit an ODI hundred at Headingley, with India the victims. He was also in charge for Yorkshire\'s thumping defeat at Middlesex, in which they chased down 472 in the fourth innings. To his amusement, his team-mates dubbed him ""Craptain"". ', ""His full potential then poured forth in 2015 when he made 1385 Test runs in the year, and vied with Australia's Steven Smith at the top of the ICC Test rankings. Root played with alacrity on all surfaces and in all formats and his obvious delight in his art was a positive symbol in an England side committed in all formats to a more enterprising approach. Jaunty Ashes hundreds at Cardiff and Nottingham helped England to victories, his consistency at No. 4 repeatedly masked top-order frailties, and a mischievous sense of humour made his success all the more pleasurable."", 'As England fell to defeat against Pakistan in the UAE in late 2015, a pattern began to build up which piqued Root even as he confirmed himself as one of the best batsmen around: his world became rather too full of entertaining 70s and 80s when he felt that a big hundred was there for the taking. Between his hundred in Johannesburg in early 2016 on a triumphant England tour and a century in Rajkot as England slumped 4-0 to India, he passed 50 six times but only converted one into a hundred. There again, it was quite a hundred: a career-best 254 against Pakistan at Old Trafford that banished talk of premature burnout in a non-stop England programme.', 'Firmly established among the modern game\'s ""Big Four"" batsmen (Root, Smith, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson), these were years of easy scoring. In 2015 and 2016 he set consecutive records for runs accumulated across all formats in a calendar year for England, with 2228 and 2570 respectively; in 2017, he came within five runs of surpassing Vaughan\'s calendar high-water mark of 1481 for England in Tests, which had stood since 2002. The following summer, with back-to-back efforts against India, Root surpassed Marcus Trescothick\'s English record of 12 ODI hundreds.', ""Problems of conversion returned to afflict him in his second year as Test captain, however.

6 ft 4 in ",,,Left-hand bat,Left-arm fast-medium,,Father - ,,"[""\nRyan Sidebottom, with his unruly mop of curly, ginger hair, has long been one of the most recognisable and respected figures on the county circuit. His international career is now behind him but he can draw much satisfaction not only from the manner in which he took a belated second chance in international cricket, but the way that latterly he has committed himself with skill and determination to an extended career on England's professional circuit with Yorkshire, the county of his birth. \n"", 'Like his father Arnie, who was an accomplished footballer and one-time Test player, Ryan made his county debut for Yorkshire having previously impressed the scouts of Sheffield United Football Club. For much of his career it appeared Sidebottom jnr, a left-armer unlike Arnie, would also follow his father in Test cricket by remaining a one-cap wonder. He was handed his debut in 2001 against Pakistan, but after a wicketless performance was banished back to county cricket. Although he bowled tidily throughout, he was generally considered to be out of his depth and was quickly discarded, and seemingly forgotten after two poor ODIs against Zimbabwe that October. He proved them wrong, possessing a resolve and bowling nous that few had recognised.', 'He left Yorkshire in 2004 and headed to nearby Nottinghamshire, where he impressed in his first two seasons. The first year there he helped them to a double promotion, and the second year he took 50 first-class wickets to become the Player of the Year and help them to the Championship title for the first time in 18 years.', ""With Duncan Fletcher, England's coach, obsessed by finding bowlers of true pace, Sidebottom was continually overlooked despite having one of the best records in the country. However, six years after his debut - under the new Peter Moores regime - he was surprisingly recalled after a spate of injuries to England's attack. He responded with eight wickets against West Indies at Headingley, still his spiritual home, and developed into a key member of the line-up. He helped England to a 3-0 win over West Indies before bowling without luck against India."", ""Equally impressive with the white ball he was Man of the Series as England won the one-day tournament in Sri Lanka, but it was during the New Zealand leg of England's winter that he really shone, decimating the hosts with 24 wickets at 17.08, including 7 for 47 in the final Test in Napier."", ""Further success followed in the home series against New Zealand, during which he was unveiled as England's Player of the Year, but the pressures of carrying England's attack took their toll, and he struggled for fitness thereafter, culminating in an Achilles injury that limited him to a single wicket in an arduous tour of the Caribbean in February 2009. While injuries dented his opportunities in Test cricket thereafter he became an important member of the one-day side. In the 2010 World Twenty20 in the Caribbean his selection ahead of James Anderson raised a few eyebrows, but he proved the doubters wrong as his fiery and disciplined opening bowling was a crucial part of England's triumph."", 'His England career, though, ended with his international retirement late in 2010, leaving him to play out time on the domestic scene. After helping Nottinghamshire to a last-gasp Championship title that summer, he returned to his Yorkshire roots for the final stage of his career.', 'Given that Yorkshire were relegated it was not immediately the return he hoped for, although on a personal level 2011 was a highly successful season. His 62 first-class wickets at 22.00, including three five-wicket hauls and a career best 7 for 37 against Somerset at Headingley, were the most he had taken in a single season. He contributed useful runs, too, including two fifties in an aggregate of 389 in the Championship. His 61 against Worcestershire at New Road was a career best. ', ""He missed a large part of the 2012 promotion season to injury but signed a further contract extension until the end of 2015 towards the end of a summer which saw him lead Yorkshire's Championship bowling records with 49 wickets at 20.30 apiece. He won the Members' Player of the Year award as a result, and hankered after 700 first-class wickets before he took his boots off for the last time. He achieved a landmark achieved by few in spectacular style against Middlesex as Yorkshire completed successive Championship wins, taking four wickets in his first four overs, including a hat-trick, and topping the county averages at 37. Five years on from his international retirement, his longevity was deeply impressive."", 'As well as leaving his father, Arnie - 596 first-class victims - by now a long way in his slipstream, he also had five Championship titles, adding two with Yorkshire to the three won with Notts. He swung the ball as consistently as any bowler on the county circuit and his accuracy was exemplary.

Following Michael Vaughan\'s return home due to injury early in the tour, Shah was drafted in as a replacement and made a composed and vital 88 in a memorable victory. A stylish and classical batsman who seemed to have the world at his feet as a teenager, he was compared in ability to the young Mark Ramprakash. Shah made his first-class debut in 1996, and at the end of the promising summer, Wisden praised his ""abundant promise"". His county cap followed, but back-to-back seasons with averages in the mid 20s ended with him being dropped by Middlesex in 2000.  \n', ""He bounced back in 2001 in fine form, and was drafted into England's one-day side in the NatWest Series where he looked at ease, especially when making 62 against Pakistan at Lord's.

He was overlooked in 2002, but again played a few one-dayers the following winter in the ICC Knock-out Trophy and in the VB Series, but he found it almost impossible to forge a place in the side.  Another solid season followed, but others edged ahead of him in the pecking order, and there was talk that his fielding was not helping his cause. His international ambitions suffered a further blow when he was relieved of the vice-captaincy at Middlesex in June 2004 after a string of bad results. However, a feast of runs in 2005 (1728 runs at a healthy average of 66.46) led to his inclusion in the England A tour of the Caribbean in 2006, and ultimately his Test debut. Further opportunities were thin on the ground, however. He had to wait 18 months for his second Test - another one-off appearance, this time at Lord's against West Indies where he failed twice - but a series of eyecatching performances followed in the one-day series, as England rebuilt after another disappointing World Cup campaign. Despite the continued failings of England's top 6, he was but a spectator and drinks carrier for the Test tours of Sri Lanka and New Zealand."", ""Good county form and half-centuries in the home ODIs against New Zealand ensured he travelled to India at the end of 2008, and he finally got his opportunity in the Caribbean the following spring, following the selectors' temporary loss of patience with Ian Bell. An anxious Shah failed to cement his position, however, with his uncertain running-between-the-wickets proving his downfall, and he was overlooked for the subsequent home summer as Ravi Bopara leapt into the No. 3 position."", ""Though he remained a key figure in the one-day set-up, he was surprisingly axed for the tour of South Africa in 2009-10, despite a memorable 98 from 89 balls in the Champions Trophy that preceded it. As England settled on a formula that delivered both Twenty20 and one-day success it appeared as though Shah's international career was over and he was dealt a further blow when he was unceremoniously released by Middlesex at the end of the 2010 season and signed for Essex, although his debut was delayed by the IPL. Decent returns in 2011 and 2012 saw him retained by Essex on a further one-year deal but Shah was an increasingly itinerant cricketer, taking in stints in Australia's Big Bash and the Bangladesh Premier League as he moved towards a career as a T20 specialist.

His mind-over-matter approach made him a natural captain, and in 1994 - with a little help from Brian Lara's bat and Bob Woolmer's coaching - he led Warwickshire to three of the four major trophies, failing only in the NatWest final. Reeve was already an occasional member of England's one-day side by this stage - having appeared for his native Hong Kong in the 1982 ICC Trophy - and played in the 1992 World Cup final, but he was given just three Tests, all in New Zealand in 1991-92. His international career would have been longer if his ability to irk opponents hadn't extended to his team-mates.

5 ft 8 in ",,,Right-hand bat,,,,,"[""\nChris Read, born in Devon, reared in Bristol and an England A tourist before he had played a first-class game, retired in 2017 as one of county cricket's most respected performers. From an early age, he quickly established himself as the tidiest gloveman in English cricket. But life as a wicketkeeping purist was no longer any guarantee of success by the time his career reached fulfilment and, even more than Jack Russell before him, he soon realised that England honours would not come easily.  He played 15 Tests and 36 ODIs for England between 1999 and 2007 before his career faltered on the rock known as Duncan Fletcher - England's coach at the time felt he was too undemonstrative as a keeper and a batsman overly committed to attack - but many admirers campaigned for his selection long after England had decided to look elsewhere. \n"", ""Not that Read was a poor batsman - far from it. He averaged 18.94 in Tests, but doubled that in the first-class game. A back-foot fighter with a productive whip-pull, he batted as high as No. 6 in the Nottinghamshire middle order and at one of the more treacherous batting venues in the country, he was often charged with walking out at Trent Bridge to avert a collapse with an individualistic mix of enterprise and batting gumption. It became one of county cricket's great sights."", 'Nothing encapsulated Read more than the manner of his parting. He had retired from the limited-overs game (Nottinghamshire won both trophies in his absence) but there was still a promotion to win in the final game of the Championship season in 2017. Midway through that game at Hove, disaster threatened. At 56 for 5, with Sussex\'s first innings of 565 light years away, defeat was looming. Read and Billy Root responded with centuries, the match was drawn and the eulogies could be written without any sense of regret. ""A magical season,"" he said as he reflected on a career that brought more than county records as a wicketkeeper, more than 16,000 first-class runs, just over 7,000 in limited-overs formats and considerable pleasure for all who watched him.', ""Almost two decades earlier, the emphasis was on England. When Read was picked by England against New Zealand in 1999, he infamously ducked into a Chris Cairns slower ball which he lost above the Lord's sightscreen. He made the one-day team that winter in South Africa and, despite a below-par performance behind the stumps, showed composure with the bat, memorably mowing Shaun Pollock for six to reignite a run-chase."", ""Read lost ground after his debut, dropping behind rivals such as Paul Nixon, strangely, and then James Foster, initially championed by the England coach at the time, Duncan Fletcher, in the race to become England's next keeper. But he was a more rounded player by the time Alec Stewart finally hung up his gloves in 2003. He duly returned to the top of the pile and, after an immaculate time behind the stumps in the Caribbean, he was controversially dropped in favour of another Fletcher hunch - Geraint Jones, a better batsman, although arguably not by much. Two months later, and Read had been axed from the one-day side as well, despite some combative performances low down the order."", ""He remained on the fringes of the team and an impressive unbeaten 150 for England A against the Pakistanis in July 2006 finally convinced the management that he was due another chance. A brisk 55 in his comeback Test against Pakistan, in the 3rd Test at Headingley, demonstrated a cricketer with far greater confidence in himself than in his youth. In a Fletcher-inspired see-saw, he was again left out for the 2006-07 Ashes before Jones's loss of form meant he was recalled for the last two Tests."", ""But Nixon edged him out for the one-day series that followed, and the emergence of Peter Moores as Fletcher's successor and the selection of Matt Prior meant Read slipped gently down the list of keepers. Craig Kieswetter's emergence provided another favoured alternative and put paid to any hopes that Read might be able to add to his 52 England caps."", ""If England proved unfaithful suitors, he remained a vital part of Nottinghamshire's squad. As he entered his 30s, in spite of taking on the extra demands of captaincy at Trent Bridge, he found a golden run of form that saw him average 42.06 in 2008, and rise to become Nottinghamshire's leading run-scorer by some distance in 2009, with 1203 runs at 75.18, including four hundreds, as the county finished as Division One runners-up. That he had found a mode of batting when England honours were no longer likely became more apparent with every passing season. In 2015, now 37, his average topped 50 and he even headed Notts' batting averages. His England exclusion felt more premature than ever."", ""Such analyses are worth listing in detail because they communicate how run-scoring had suddenly become part of his game. He was a respected captain, too, although at the end of a challenging 2013 season for Notts, in which they avoided relegation none too surely and won the YB40 final, he conceded the one-day captaincy to James Taylor who as a result was identified as Notts' potential captain-in-waiting if his own England career did not go according to plan.\n"", '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 1997'],15.0,23,4,360.0,55,18.94,912,39.47,0,1,36,4,48.0,6.0,36.0,24,7,300.0,30*,17.64,410,73.17,0,0,21,6,41.0,2.0,1.0,1,0,13.0,13,13.00,11,118.18,0,0,2,0,1.0,0.0,349.0,526,87,16361,240,37.26,,,26,92,,,1051.0,53.0,333.0,265,74,5564,135,29.13,,,2,24,,,319.0,73.0,119.0,98,36,1441,58*,23.24,1160,124.22,0,1,106,38,60.0,27.0,15.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,36.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,1.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,349.0,,96,90,0,-,-,-,5.62,-,0,0,0,333.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,119.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

When it is a young legspinner the hype is magnified. When it is a young spinner of Pakistani extraction, brought up in Yorkshire, the sense of excitement becomes palpable. Adil Rashid, the player who above all symbolized Yorkshire's growing success in fostering strong relationships in its minority ethnic communities, burst onto the scene with six wickets against Warwickshire on his first-class debut in 2006 at Scarborough. There was a sense in Yorkshire's much-loved seaside town that afternoon as Rashid cut through Warwickshire that a historic breakthrough had been made and more than one Yorkshire supporter observed Rashid's performance with hearts uplifted. \n"", 'A decade later, as he left a tour of India in which England had been trounced 4-0, it was still occasionally possible to see the vulnerable, taciturn 18-year-old of whom Yorkshire were so protective. Rashid had 10 Test caps, all of them in the UAE or South Asia where England needed a second spinner, but even on such surfaces he needed careful handling in case his leg spin succumbed under the pressure. He seemed happiest in limited-overs cricket where the game unfolded in a more predictable fashion and he knew that batsmen would be committed to attack. It was hard to imagine him as a single spinner in England unless he became more serviceable, but such had been remarked of countless legspinners before him.', ""A five-wicket haul on debut against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi after a return of 0 for plenty in the first innings augured well (setting up a short run chase which England narrowly failed to achieve) and he also brushed up well a year later in Dhaka at the start of England's 2016-17 tour of Bangladesh and India. His India series gradually took a turn for the worse, however, the promise of Rajkot and Visakhapatnam giving way to a more pessimistic air - and some hefty figures in the runs column - in Mumbai and Chennai. He had the ability to hoover up a tail at both England and county level; sometimes the problem was getting to it."", ""In the limited-overs formats, Rashid was a vital component of England's attack and a first-class average with the bat in the mid-30s told of a player who would not have been consigned to the tail in many England XIs in the past."", ""Rashid's also caught the eye early in his career for England Under-19s nd an eight-wicket haul during the second Test against India. But he suffered a stress fracture in his back in the close season which forced him to remodel his action. His profile rose further in 2007 when he struck his maiden Championship century against Worcestershire in August and at the end of the season the Cricket Writers' Club made him their Young Cricketer of the Year. In 2008 he enjoyed his most prolific season with 62 wickets in the County Championship and was a late addition to the squad for the Test series in India. That trip was purely for experience, however, as was the tour to West Indies which followed, but even so his career shone with potential."", 'Rashid responded the following season with 545 runs at 68.12, including two hundreds, and picked up 31 wickets at 36.06 in the 2009 first-class season. His statistics in one-day and Twenty20 cricket were more modest, but the selectors held faith in his potential, and he made his England debut during the World Twenty in June of that year. He also played in the post-Ashes one-day series against Australia, but his most notable achievement came with the bat when he scored a quickfire 31 in a narrow defeat at The Oval.', 'Rashid was included in the party to tour South Africa in 2009-10, but had a difficult time on the trip. He began amid high hopes that his combination of legspin and promising lower-order batting could cement a permanent role in the side, but his solitary over in the second Twenty20 went for 25, then he bowled three overs for 27 in the second ODI before being left out for a fit-again Graeme Swann. When he was released from the one-day party, James Tredwell, the Kent offspinner, remained on stand-by which suggested Rashid had fallen down the pecking order. ', ""Andy Flower, England's coach, rightly suggested that he would benefit from a chance to deepen his game at county level, but progress was not immediate. Yorkshire, by now, were showing signs of disquiet over Rashid's bowling. England had demanded that he bowled much quicker and his confidence and method had deserted him when he returned from international duty. His county form faltered, although he did win a place in the England Lions squad to tour UAE and was called-up briefly for the end of the World Cup campaign."", 'At home, Rashid enjoyed his most productive season for Yorkshire in 2010, scoring 732 first-class runs at 45.75 and taking 57 wickets at 31.29. He began the 2011 season with a bang, taking 6 for 77 and 5 for 37 to secure victory against Worcestershire at New Road, the best figures for a leg-spinner in Yorkshire history, but failed to maintain his form, finishing the season with 39 wickets at 43.38. From 10 Championship matches in 2012 he totalled only 16 wickets and 129 runs and his discontent was apparent. ', ""Rashid was at a crossroads. But more than 800 Championship runs at 50-plus in 2013 suggested that in his mid-20s not just his batting was maturing, and his bowling became more thoughtful, and dangerous in turn with a good googly particularly evident. Yorkshire's challenge was to bring his career to fruition, to bring him not just success on the field but a general contentment. A career that had begun with so much optimism began to reawaken England's interest again - cagily at first with a Lions recall - as Yorkshire won the title in 2014. The appointment of Trevor Bayliss as coach coincided with his return to the England side for the first time in nearly six years, a string of limited-overs displays being joined by limited success in his first three Tests, against Pakistan on the slow, big turners of the UAE."", 'He was a much-loved figure on Yorkshire grounds, contributing to back-to-back Championships in 2014 and 15, and dubbed ""The Hoover"" by the head coach Jason Gillespie. But his request to rest out a title decider against Middlesex at Lord\'s the following year - he later explained that his grandmother was unwell - exasperated his captain, Andrew Gale.

But even then the picture tells nothing of the astonishing agility of ""Arkle"": a split-second earlier, as the ball screeched overhead, he had been on his haunches three feet clear of any danger. A hyperactive cover fieldsman, who was often actually galloping in  as the bowler reached the crease, Randall, in a day\'s fielding, habitually saved 20 runs through quicksilver interceptions and the safe singles his mobility inhibited. As a batsman he was in David Gower\'s class when it came to timing a cover-drive, but he was a twitchy starter, especially when there was movement for the seamers, and was at his most effective at No. 5 or 6. ', ' \n', '\nIt was said of Derek Randall that he could catch swallows. Watching him\npatrolling the covers, you could almost believe it.

With Randall on one side of the\nwicket and David Gower on the other, few batsmen chanced quick singles\nagainst England.', 'But there was more to Randall than his fielding. There was his\nspectacular, eccentric batting too. His Test record of 2,470 runs in 47\nmatches at an average of just over 33 betrays a lack of consistency, but\nwhen he was good, he was very, very good. There was his match-winning knock\nat Sydney in 1978-79 when, with England trailing after the first innings by 142\nruns, Randall held the second innings together with a magnificent 150. But\nthat was against an Australian side depleted by the Packer ban. On a\ndifferent plain altogether was his 174 in 1977 in the Centenary Test against\na strong Australia side at Melbourne. With England chasing an improbable 463\nto win, Randall took them unbelievably close - doffing his cap to the mighty\nDennis Lillee in the process after just evading a bouncer - but in the end\ntheir valiant chase fell 46 runs short.', ""Randall, known as Arkle after the racehorse, was seldom far from the\ndrama. His lightning run-out of Rick McCosker in the Test when England\nclinched the Ashes at Headingley in 1977 amazed all who witnessed it.

In 2003 he made a century on first-class debut as an opener for Warwickshire against a strong Sussex attack - he was 96 not out at lunch - and in 2009 he made a century on Test debut at The Oval. To have played such a significant part in England winning an Ashes decider earned his reputation as a technically correct, temperamentally sound top-order batsman. Though less glorious tours of South Africa and Bangladesh followed, Trott sealed his reputation with a double-century against Bangladesh at Lord's and a masterful 184 against a Pakistan side at the same ground. Though the match was later tarnished by spot-fixing revelations, Trott later said he considered the innings his best as he defied Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif and helped rescue England from 102 for 7."", ""Trott went on to play a key part in England retaining the Ashes in Australia in 2010-11 - the first time they had won a Test series there in nearly a quarter of a century - with centuries at Adelaide and Melbourne and the defeat of India in England the following summer to assume the No.1 Test ranking. His standing as the finest No. 3 England had possessed for many years was confirmed. Despite a relatively lean 2012, during which he averaged 38.65, Trott's remarkable consistency was demonstrated by a run at the start of the following year, when his lowest score in 17 consecutive Test and ODI innings was 27, with two hundreds and six half-centuries."", 'Born in Cape Town to a British father and South African mother, Trott played for the South Africa side from Under-15 to Under-19 level, graduating into the Boland and then the Western Province teams. His future in the South Africa side looked assured. But Trott, never easily satisfied, wanted more. Bored by further education - he admits he had to look at the blackboard to even spell the subject during the psychology portion of his exam in the Human Movement Science degree he abandoned at Stellenbosch University - he took advantage of his British passport and his relationship with Bob Woolmer, who coached South Africa and Warwickshire, to arrange a trail in England. He soon embraced the club and country with a passion, marrying the granddaughter of former club captain HE ""Tom"" Dollery and insisting he felt ""completely British"" and that he preferred Birmingham to Cape Town.', ""There have been some downs amid the ups. In 2007, in the middle of Mark Greatbatch's unhappy period as director of cricket at Edgbaston, Trott endured a chronic loss of form that saw him average only 22 and Warwickshire suffer relegation in both first-class and List A formats. Oddly, he made his international debut that season having been called into the England T20I team. After breaking his hand in the nets prior to the match, it was one of the few times he made an underwhelming debut. "", ""Despite setting a record in 2009 for the most runs in an English domestic T20 season of 10 matches, some have never accepted his value as a limited-overs player, either. While Trott's ODI average in excess of 50 is substantially higher than any regular England player in ODI history, his strike-rate of around 75 was a source of constant discussion - never more so than during the 2013 Champions Trophy, when the make-up of England's top three was questioned. The records showed, however, that when Trott flourishes, England flourished too, and he was their leading run-scorer as they narrowly failed to win the competition."", 'His presence at the crease had arguably become the most reassuring sight in English cricket since the retirement of Graham Gooch. His prolonged marking of his guard was as near as cricket got to a national talking point. But when he abruptly left England\'s 2012-13 Ashes tour after the first Test in Brisbane with a stress-related illness, England\'s director of cricket, Andy Flower, bemoaned the loss of his ""rock"".', 'An early attempt at a comeback at the start of the 2014 season had to be aborted after it transpired there would be no quick fix to his problems and a discomfort against the short ball became more apparent. But, after a break, he returned strongly towards the end of the season, ending the Royal London One-Day campaign as the highest England-qualified run-scorer and helping Warwickshire to second place in the Championship. It was enough to win him a recall to the Lions squad for the tour of South Africa and, following a double-century there, a Test recall in the Caribbean.', 'Asked to open the batting, he reached double-figures only once in six innings and suffered three ducks as it became apparent that he was still troubled by anxiety problems. It was no surprise when he announced his retirement from international cricket at the end of the tour. He played on for Warwickshire until 2018, a consummate team man. His final summer was relaxed and productive, helped by his early announcement of his intention to retire. As it wound down, there was even a double century stand with Ian Bell against Kent to encourage nostalgia. ""There are only so many runs you can score,"" he said when it was all over.\n', '\n']",[],52.0,93,6,3835.0,226,44.08,8128,47.18,9,19,451,0,29.0,0.0,68.0,65,10,2819.0,137,51.25,3658,77.06,4,22,216,3,14.0,0.0,7.0,7,1,138.0,51,23.00,144,95.83,0,1,9,3,0.0,0.0,281.0,468,47,18662,226,44.32,,,46,92,,,223.0,0.0,274.0,253,44,10056,137,48.11,,,23,67,,,77.0,0.0,81.0,76,16,2147,86*,35.78,1870,114.81,0,13,219,34,18.0,0.0,52.0,33,708,400,5.0,1/5,1/5,80.0,3.38,141.6,0,0,0,68.0,10,183,166,2.0,2/31,2/31,83.0,5.44,91.5,0,0,0,7.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,281.0,,6206,3487,70,7/39,,49.81,3.37,88.6,,1,0,274.0,,1788,1700,58,4/55,4/55,29.31,5.70,30.8,2,0,0,81.0,11,144,234,8,2/19,2/19,29.25,9.75,18.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

6 ft 3 in ",,Opening batsman,Left-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"['\nA brutal left-handed opening batsman, Marcus Trescothick was one of the finest opening batsmen to play for England and also stood in as captain for two Tests and 10 ODIs.  He was an automatic choice from the turn of the century until a stress-related illness intervened with him not much past his 30th birthday and forced his international retirement in 2008. The anxiety attacks he suffered, particularly when having to contend with long periods away from home and family, brought the issue of depression and stress in sport into sharp focus in the English game and there was general delight when he continued his county career at Somerset where his genial biffing of county attacks brought much entertainment at Taunton and elsewhere. Somerset sought his services beyond his 40th birthday, confirming him as one of the great stalwarts of the English game in any era. \n', ""Capacious of build and comfortable of movement, he had a benign air at the crease which meant that when he bullied attacks, which he did often, he bullied them gently. Not particularly mobile in the field, he turned himself into a safe slip fielder. He was a key factor in England's change in fortunes and, most notably, spearheaded an aggressive approach against Australia in the Ashes win of 2005. "", ""There was something biblical about Trescothick's early career: seven years of plenty as a schoolboy, seven years of famine when he reached the Somerset 1st XI. And lo, it came to pass in 1999 that he batted on a pacey pitch at Taunton against Glamorgan while Duncan Fletcher was their coach, and made a storming 167, with five sixes, when the next-best score was 50. When England needed a stand-in one-day opener in 2000, Fletcher, by then elevated to the England job, remembered Trescothick. He took to international cricket immediately. A true opener, he formed a habit of starting a series well with a mixture of expert leaves, crisp cover-drives, spanking pulls and fearless slog-sweeps."", ""Hefty, genial, and at ease on the big stage, Trescothick's first four England hundreds came in a losing cause, confirming his ability to keep his head while all around were losing theirs. Opening in Tests with Mike Atherton, Trescothick acquired the air of a senior player as if by osmosis - he joined the management committee on his first tour. All that stood between him and the highest level was a tendency to get out when well set, to make a breezy 20 or 30. He seemed to have conquered this with a domineering home season in 2002, but it reappeared - like so many English frailties - as soon as the team landed in Australia. Trescothick endured fluctuating fortunes over the next couple of seasons. He showed glimpses of his blazing best against South Africa in 2003, when he capped his season with a determined 219 (and 69 not out) in the astonishing series-levelling victory at The Oval, but his form slid away drastically in the Caribbean that winter."", ""The selectors never lost faith with him and, having stood in as captain for the first Test of the 2004 season, Trescothick cracked a pair of hundreds against West Indies at Edgbaston. At Johannesburg in 2004-05, he set up England's series victory with a brutal 180 on the final morning, and carried his domineering form into the home season. Having bullied 345 runs in two innings against the Bangladeshis, he made 431 runs against Australia in a memorable summer of 2005, as he - and England - finally got the better of the one nation that really mattered. He cracked 90 in the second Test at Edgbaston, underlining that this England side was not lying down. It ignited the summer, a hope-laden innings from a player who was widely praised as the most selfless of cricketers."", 'But his winter was cut short when he returned home suddenly from India under a cloak of secrecy, and after an indifferent summer it was announced he would miss the Champions Trophy as he was still recovering from a stress-related illness. He was included in the Ashes squad for the 2006-07 campaign Down Under but lasted less than two weeks before he was again boarding a flight back home with a recurrence of his illness.', ""His return to action started with Somerset and his 2007 form, plus England's continued failings in one-day cricket, meant he was recalled to England's preliminary 30-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup. But he never made the cut, and, in March 2008, days after withdrawing at the last minute from Somerset's pre-season tour to the UAE - he was in an outlet of Dixons, the electrical store, when he decided he could not board the plane - he announced his retirement from international cricket. His candid autobiography, "", "", was published in 2008, and told of his battle with the 'black wings' of depression."", ""The book had a cathartic effect. In 2009 he enjoyed one of his most prolific seasons yet, scoring nearly 3,000 runs for Somerset in all competitions. He was named captain following Justin Langer's decision not to return for 2010 and even overcame his reservations to take part in the county's Champions League campaign in India that October, although he flew home after the group stages."", ""Already enshrined in Somerset folklore, with a stand named in his honour, he nearly delivered the ultimate prize in 2010. His 1,397 runs at 58.20 helped Somerset enter the final day of the season knowing victory at Durham would be enough to win them their maiden County Championship. But time ran out on Somerset and Nottinghamshire achieved the bonus point they needed with three wickets after tea to snatch the title. Seemingly getting better with age, Trescothick plundered 1,673 runs in 2011 at a career-best season's average of 79.66. He also led Somerset to the finals of both the Friends Life t20 and Cyldesdale Bank 40, only to lose both. A year later, injury and poor weather resulted in a less-than-prolific season but, undeterred by his advancing years, Trescothick signed a new three year deal with Somerset in November 2012 but failed to score a century in any competition in 2013 - the first time in his career he has gone through a season without a three figure score. He recovered, in the first-class game at least, rattling up a formidable 1284 runs at 45.86 to help offset Somerset's relegation fears in 2015, including 210 not out in a vital late-season draw against Sussex at Hove."", ""He must have felt as he passed his 40th birthday on Christmas Day that his chances of leading Somerset to that elusive Championship title had diminished. But he could not have imagined the agonising miss that befell Somerset in 2016 when they wrapped up a win in their final game at Taunton with a day to spare, went top of the table, but watched Middlesex and Yorkshire - both with title aspirations of their own - manufacture a positive result at Lord's. Trescothick had a wonderful personal season to look back on: 1,239 Championship runs and four more hundreds, capped by 218 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, an innings made on a stonkingly hot day which took him alongside Harold Gimblett as Somerset's most prolific century-maker in first-class cricket. He entered 2017 amid hopes in the West Country that the record would come his way at Taunton with the Quantocks shimmering in the haze and the chance to raise a glass to it with a post-match cider in the Ring of Bells. It duly arrived in May, bringing delight to an otherwise drab rain-affected draw against Warwickshire."", 'By now, uncertainty over whether Trescothick would play on had become an annual ritual. In 2018, he broke his foot while turning awkwardly when batting against Lancashire at Old Trafford (on 95, he hobbled to a century), but retained the desire to recover before the end of the season andagree another year at his beloved Taunton.', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1996,1997', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005']",76.0,143,10,5825.0,219,43.79,10685,54.51,14,29,831,42,95.0,0.0,123.0,122,6,4335.0,137,37.37,5087,85.21,12,21,528,41,49.0,0.0,3.0,3,0,166.0,72,55.33,131,126.71,0,2,23,1,2.0,0.0,385.0,665,36,26089,284,41.47,,,66,127,,,550.0,0.0,372.0,357,29,12229,184,37.28,,,28,63,,,149.0,0.0,89.0,87,5,2363,108*,28.81,1569,150.60,2,17,304,80,29.0,0.0,76.0,10,300,155,1.0,1/34,1/34,155.0,3.10,300.0,0,0,0,123.0,13,232,219,4.0,2/7,2/7,54.75,5.66,58.0,0,0,0,3.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,385.0,,2704,1551,36,4/36,,43.08,3.44,75.1,,0,0,372.0,,2010,1644,57,4/50,4/50,28.84,4.90,35.2,1,0,0,89.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

5 ft 11 in ",,Allrounder,Left-hand bat,Right-arm offbreak,,,,"[""\nJames Tredwell's unassuming manner gives him the air of a Rotary Club chairman rather than an international sportsman, but for all his mild-mannered ways he quietly built a decent cricketing career with both Kent and England. When he retired in 2018, having not played a game in his final summer, he had taken 830 wickets for Kent in 613 matches since making his debut in 2000 and also made a decent contribution to England in difficult times. \n"", ""He had racked up almost a decade of unswerving county service by the time England gave him the first of his 45 ODI caps, against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2010, and his offspin - bowled in a more old-fashioned, slower style than was the norm among many of his international contemporaries - has given England stout service. Such is Tredwell's unfashionable air that he was content to talk ahead of an England tour of his hobby making home-made jam and chutney, and imagined packing a couple of jars to help him through his latest overseas assignment.  In Kent in particular, they valued his gentle talents, backed up by excellent close catching and some useful lower-order batting.  As Vic Marks wrote in "", ': ""James Tredwell is not and never will be a superstar. He is the journeyman\'s journeyman and a fine antidote to the celebrity cricketer.""', ""\nIt was as a limited-overs cricketer that Tredwell also made most of his early appearances for Kent but by 2003 he was representing the county in both forms of the game on a regular basis. He captained the England Under-19s side and led Kent second XI to success in the Second XI Trophy final of 2002 when he scored 111. His obvious potential elevated him to a place in the ECB National Academy squad for 2003-04, where he found himself captaining the squad in difficult circumstances following the withdrawal of Alex Gidman. His performances earned him a call up to the England Performance Squad in the winter of 2007. He was subsequently rewarded with inclusion in England's one-day squad for their tour of New Zealand in 2008."", ""Tredwell didn't get a game on that tour, but steady performances with the England Lions and Kent, including a career-best 123 not out against a touring New Zealand side and 69 wickets in the County Championship in 2009 kept him in contention. He was called up as cover for Swann during England's tour to South Africa in 2009-10 and, although once again he did not feature in a starting XI, he was included in the Lions tour to UAE in February 2010. His consistent performances booked him a place in England's squad to tour Bangladesh in February and March 2010 and he finally made his debut in the second Test at Dhaka, taking six wickets in England's nine-wicket win.  He was one of four spinners chosen for England's tour of Sri Lanka in March 2012 and he played a part in the one-day series against Australia and South Africa that summer."", ""With Swann rested, he made his T20 international debut in India in December 2012 and then followed that up with 11 wickets in the ODIs that followed after Christmas. He was a very different character to the extrovert - and highly successful - Swann and, if he was unlikely ever to hit such heights, he made international cricket seem a polite place to be. His progress as an offspinner was steady rather than spectacular but he had a steady temperament and ability to vary his pace good habits can bring rewards and they started to come thick and fast. England's interest did not extend to Test cricket: he won his first of two caps against Bangladesh in Dhaka and, following Swann's sudden retirement during a Test whitewash in Australia in 2013-14, England looked elsewhere the following summer before giving him a second cap in Antigua in 2015."", ""Tredwell's was named Kent captain for 2013, following Rob Key's decision to stand down. But his form in first-class cricket had by then become less impressive than in the shorter formats and, under challenge from the tyro Adam Riley, he even accepted a loan spell at Sussex in 2014 in search of regular cricket before returning to Kent at the end of the season and settling back in with typical economy in the limited-overs formats."", 'England\'s disastrous World Cup campaign in Australia in 2015, though, ended his England career at 33. Peter Moores was sacked as coach, Trevor Bayliss took over and a new high-energy brand of cricket had no place for him. ""Sometimes a change of view means that some people are put on the rubbish tip,"" he said.

He had\nbegun as a brilliant counter-attacking left-hander who came off the ropes\nfrom the start of his innings to punch a quick 20 and seize the initiative,\nan invaluable trait. But being the first England player to undergo ten\nconsecutive years of touring, for the A and Test team, troubled his back,\ndulled his edge and gave him a reputation for grumpiness. In 1999-2000, he\nopted out of the tour to South Africa, a decision which seemed to be the\nfinal step before fulfilment. The winter's rest, and time for reflection\nwith his family, brought him to a mature peak - as a batsman who enjoyed his\ncricket again, the best allround fielder in the team, a contributor in the\ndressing-room and occasional captain. But in 2002 his career reached crisis\npoint as his marriage crumbled in full view of the tabloids. With England's\nbusiest-ever winter looming, he announced his retirement from the one-day\ngame, took an indefinite break from all forms of cricket, returned and\nannounced his readiness to tour Australia - and then pulled out again in a\nmove which seemed to signal the end of his Test career. However, in another turnaround at the start of the 2003 English season, Thorpe again insisted he was ready to return to England colours, in both forms of the game, but was surprisingly overlooked for the first Test against South Africa. He did return, though, for the crucial final Test at The Oval, where he delighted everyone with a century that helped set up England's astonishing comeback. Since that innings, Thorpe went on to score 1635 runs at 56.37 in England's successful run, also reaching the milestone of 100 Tests, against Bangladesh at the start of the 2005 season.  He was omitted from the squad to face Australia at Lord's on July 21, and one day into the match he announced his retirement, a decision that brought a premature end to the career of one of England's toughest competitors."", '\n', ' \n']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1998', 'Awarded the MBE in 2006']",100.0,179,28,6744.0,200*,44.66,14693,45.89,16,39,778,9,105.0,0.0,82.0,77,13,2380.0,89,37.18,3344,71.17,0,21,172,5,42.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,341.0,567,80,21937,223*,45.04,,,49,122,,,290.0,0.0,354.0,332,58,10871,145*,39.67,,,9,80,,,168.0,0.0,5.0,4,0,95,50,23.75,68,139.70,0,1,11,2,1.0,0.0,100.0,6,138,37,0.0,-,-,35.33,1.60,-,0,0,0,82.0,5,120,97,2.0,2/15,2/15,48.5,4.85,60.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,341.0,,2387,1378,26,4/40,,53.00,3.46,91.8,,0,0,354.0,,721,649,16,3/21,3/21,40.56,5.40,45.0,0,0,0,5.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

5 ft 6 in ",,Middle-order batsman,Right-hand bat,Legbreak,,,,"[""\nA prodigy who appeared to have finally broken through at international level, James Taylor found his career cruelly curtailed at the age of 26 when he was diagnosed with an incurable heart condition. Taylor had played a full part in England's 2015-16 Test series win in South Africa but just a few months later, in the opening week of the County Championship, he was forced to retire with immediate effect due to ARVC (Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy), the same condition that affected footballer Fabrice Muamba. \n"", 'During an eight-year career in which he scored a glut of runs across all three formats, Taylor was out to prove that when it comes to cricket size isn\'t everything. Players diminutive in stature have had excellent international careers - Shiv Chanderpaul is just one example of that - but when Taylor made his Test debut against South Africa at Headingley in 2012, even his batting partner, Kevin Pietersen, expressed his misgivings. Pietersen twice told England\'s coach at the time, Andy Flower, that Taylor should not have been selected. ""I have nothing against James but at 5ft 6ins he\'s one of the shortest men currently playing county cricket,"" Pietersen wrote in his autobiography. ""His dad was a jockey and James is built for the same gig. We were facing the fiercest attack in world cricket; I didn\'t think he was up for it.""', 'Taylor\'s response to such trenchant criticism was impressively modest of temper and even more persuasive in terms of performance. He just made runs: lots of them. He averaged 73 in 2013 and 88 in 2014 in domestic one-day cricket as he waited for almost two years for England to select him again after that South Africa series. He proved his ability to score runs in pressure situations on the county circuit, his ability to manipulate the ball and scurry between the wickets occasionally joined by unexpected hitting power. His ability to judge the pace of an innings was excellent and his captaincy of Nottinghamshire in one-day cricket also won approval. Finally, he was selected for a one-day tour of Sri Lanka as England built towards the 2015 World Cup, the first sign that what he called ""three years of frustrating phone calls"" were coming to an end.', 'Finally, 2015 was a year of growth. He played in 25 out of a possible 30 ODIs, and struck a maiden ODI hundred against Australia at Old Trafford in which his ability to manoeuvre the ball into gaps was once again again central to his approach. His red-ball record was not as impressive - five Championship hundreds in his first four seasons for Nottinghamshire - but that was pushed aside as he made 76 in a Test recall against Pakistan in Sharjah where even he could remark that the ball rarely bounced above knee height.', ""Taylor made runs from a young age. He represented England Under-19s, including at the 2008 World Cup, having progressed from Minor Counties cricket with Shropshire on his route to Leicestershire via the Worcestershire academy and second XI. A prolific 2009 season earned him the Cricket Writers' Club Young Player of the Year award. He scored heavily first at Leicestershire and then after moving to Nottinghamshire. England, though, took a while to be convinced, concerned not just about his stature but also a strong leg-side game that occasionally exposed him defensively."", 'He scored 3689 runs in 53 first-class matches for Leicestershire, at an average of 49.18, but was advised he needed to play first division cricket to advance his career and moved to Nottinghamshire at the end of the 2011 season. It was a calculated risk as he was aware that Trent Bridge, one of the toughest examinations for a batsman in England, would put his technique under pressure. He marked his first-class debut with a first-ball duck followed by an unbeaten century against Loughborough MCCU.', ""Taylor made his debut in the second Test against South Africa after Ravi Bopara withdrew for personal reasons.  He made 34 in a 147-run partnership with Pietersen, and looked comfortable enough doing it, helping to secure a draw for England in a match that turned to uproar when Pietersen hinted at problems in the dressing room that were soon to dramatically escalate. Taylor retained his place for the third Test but it was hardly the easiest time to make an impact and he was not picked for the tour of India. Illogical selection policies concerning England's performance squad - he was surprisingly omitted then added at a later date - caused further raised eyebrows. "", ""He played just once in the following two-year period - an ODI against Ireland in Dublin - and was overlooked, too, for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, but Australia's 5-0 whitewash quickened up the break-up of an experienced England side and left him well placed to push his claims once more.

His energy and enthusiasm seems boundless, whether he is smiting sixes with intent in one-day cricket, fielding with athleticism or producing a spell of bustling medium pace which never appears to be quite as fast as he wants it to be. He has always had ambitions to play Test cricket, but he has never quite managed to make the leap.  It is the limited-overs game that suits his talents and, if he is a reluctant Twenty20 specialist, it is the form of the game where his talents are most apparent. \n', 'That Test debut was never closer than when Andrew Flintoff retired from Test cricket after the 2009 Ashes series. He was called up to England\'s Test squad for the first time for the winter tour of South Africa. Geoff Miller, England\'s chairman of selectors, remarked: ""The retirement of Andrew Flintoff has created a vacancy for an allrounder… we believe Luke can make an impact at Test level."" Wright was expected to play in the first Test, but England decided upon a policy of six specialist batsmen.', 'Wright represented England Under-19s, won the Denis Compton medal four times and scored a century on his Championship debut for Sussex. He spent two winters at the National Academy based at Loughborough University, where he was right at home having studied Sports Science and Sports Massage there. He was also a key part of the Sussex team that won the C&G Trophy in 2006. The following year he smashed his maiden domestic Twenty20 Cup century, scoring 103 from only 45 balls against Kent at Canterbury.  Although Sussex were defeated in the semi-finals, Wright finished as the highest run scorer in the competition with 346 runs.', ""That captured England's attention. A whirlwind century for England Lions against the New Zealand tourists even brought loose talk of a Test debut. Instead, he was selected in the ODI team at The Oval later that summer, hitting 50 on debut against India although he drifted out of the one-day set-up following the 2011 World Cup with his bowling never quite strong enough to hold down a fifth bowler's spot. He careered up and down the batting order more than was good for him."", ""Wright performed admirably in England's World Twenty20-winning team in 2010. He contributed 90 runs in significant circumstances during England's successful campaign, and though he bowled only one over in the tournament, it was a pivotal one - he got rid of the in-form Cameron White in the final against Australia. He was also one of England's most combative performers in a less impressive campaign in Sri Lanka in 2012, his unbeaten 99 against Afghanistan in Colombo coming desperately close to making him the first England batsman to hit a T20 hundred. An injury ruled him out of the 2014 event in Bangladesh and when he was quietly omitted from England's squads at the start of Peter Moores' second term in charge his international prospects looked bleak."", 'He has also been in demand around the world for domestic T20 tournaments, playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia\'s Big Bash and Pune Warriors at the IPL. A sparkling 44-ball hundred against Hobart Hurricanes in the inaugural Big Bash League in 2011-12 was the fastest at that point in Australia\'s domestic competition. England\'s reversal of their international calendar in 2014, with the season beginning with one-day cricket, did not promote his cause at the IPL, where he did not attract a bid and, consigned once more to the start of a Championship season at Sussex, described his fate as ""woolly hat time.""', ""Wright's T20 skills were still evident, though. He smashed an unbeaten 153 with 11 sixes - at the time the fourth highest ever T20 score - as Sussex, who made 226 for 3, pulled off a world-record run chase with nine balls to spare. All the more remarkable as Sussex's players had been stuck in traffic approaching Chelmsford and Wright had joked on Twitter that any Sussex fan in the vicinity made like to open the innings. "", ""Sussex's valuation of his energy and optimism led them to give him the T20 captaincy in 2015 and follow up with leadership in all formats for the following season only for him to be afflicted by injury in a generally below-par season.

He is skinny, barely 6ft tall and bowls from a sprinter's run-up but after his speed caught the eye with Durham and the Lions, he was given a Test debut at the start of the 2015 summer. He made an instant impression against New Zealand, bowling above 90mph and celebrating wickets with abandon, kept his place for the visit of Australia and capped things off by taking the wicket that sealed England's Ashes victory at Trent Bridge. In no time at all, the imaginary horse that had ridden around the county grounds of England to stave off boredom had become a recognisable part of his England celebration. Here was a fast bowler of unsuppressed vitality. \n"", 'Like Stephen Harmison, Wood hails from Ashington in Northumberland and played for the same club. The former England quick also encouraged him to go to Australia at 18 to improve his game - not bad advice from a man who suffered bouts of homesickness away from the Northumberland coast. Where Harmison stands 6ft 4in tall, Wood is a level 6ft and delivers a whippier, skiddier ball. In his first five first-class appearances, he took 19 wickets at 21.63, including a match-winning 5 for 78 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in August 2012.', ""Paul Collingwood's appetite for promoting and encouraging Durham's younger crop of players worked in his favour in 2013. He had a breakthrough summer, claiming 27 first-class wickets at 24.07 to help Durham to the Championship title and confirm his status as the latest in an impressive collection of homegrown pace bowlers. That strong showing was enough to win recognition on the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka, though it lasted only one match before he returned home with a side injury. His 2014 season was further disrupted by the first appearance of a long-running ankle problem but he was again involved with the Lions at the start of 2015 before being called up to the Test squad for the Caribbean."", ""He did not get a run against West Indies but was capped in the washed-out ODI against Ireland, picking up his first England wicket, and then replaced Chris Jordan in the Test side for a Lord's debut. Wood thought he had taken the wicket of Martin Guptill in his third over, only for replays to show he had overstepped, but he eventually finished with 4 for 140 as England won a thriller. Further limited-overs involvement followed but England were already aware Wood's workload would need careful managing - he played the first two Ashes Tests but missed out at Edgbaston. James Anderson's side strain allowed him to return at Trent Bridge and he took one of the two wickets not claimed by Stuart Broad as Australia were dismissed for 60. Two days later, the imaginary horse got an outing after Wood took the wicket that secured the return of the urn."", ""He made a blistering comeback from injury in the second half of 2016, delivering some of the most potent fast-bowling spells of the season as he helped Durham's to the final of the NatWest T20 Blast and also featured in England's 4-1 victory over Pakistan in their one-day international series. But further ankle issues ruled him out of a tour to Bangladesh and he missed India, too, after it was discovered that he bowled at the tail end of the English domestic season when his ankle was fractured. It all meant that he faced a third ankle operation within a year and, however optimistic the prognosis, cast doubts upon the resilience of a player who had won a reputation as England's fastest bowler. His comeback in 2017 was then afflicted by heel problems which limited him to five early-season Championship matches, somewhat down on pace, and saw him lose his England central contract at the end of the season."", ""Lost England contract or not, England could not resist his potential. He sandwiched a disastrous debut in the IPL (conceding 49 in four overs for Chennai Super Kinds and never seen again) in between Tests in Christchurch and against Pakistan at Lord's, where his average pace  of 87mph restated his threat, but his ODI displays were unpredictable and he admitted in Sri Lanka that he was running out of opportunities to claim his place for the 2019 World Cup. He experimented with a longer run up to try to combat his injuries."", 'Wood played minor counties cricket for Northumberland from 2008 to 2010 before making his first-class debut for Durham against Durham MCCU in April 2011.

It looked as if he may be remembered as one of England's nearly men. \n"", 'But fate offered another chance. A knee injury to Ben Stokes saw Woakes recalled to the squad to play Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street. On the same day he claimed career-best figures of 9 for 36 against Durham - ""It was like facing 90mph leg-breaks,"" Paul Collingwood said - and, with Alastair Cook insisting Woakes\' batting gave him the edge (both Paul Farbrace and Trevor Bayliss wanted Jake Ball to play), he made it back into the XI.', ""It was to prove the start of a golden summer. After career-bests (up to that point) with bat and ball at Chester-le-Street, he made a maiden Test half-century at Lord's and followed it with an unbeaten 95 to help England to an unlikely tie in an ODI at Trent Bridge. It was the highest score by a No. 8 or lower in the history of ODIs and helped England recover from 92 for 6 in pursuit of 287."", ""Then, at Lord's, he claimed 11 for 102 against Pakistan, becoming the first England bowler since Ian Botham in 1978 to take a five-wicket haul in each innings of a Test at the ground. He followed it with another seven wickets and a half-century in Manchester and five more wickets in Birmingham. His 26 wickets at 16.73 apiece were a record in a series between England and Pakistan. Woakes, finally, had arrived at the top level. He was named one of "", ""'s Cricketers of the Year for his efforts."", 'In many ways it was a surprise it had taken so long. Woakes had long been a highly respected player at county level. He made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in 2006 as a 17-year-old and, before he was 20, was topping the county\'s bowling averages (45 wickets at 20.48 in 2008) with impressive control and an ability to swing the ball both ways. Most of all, though, he impressed with an apparently unflappable temperament that Ashley Giles, director of cricket at Warwickshire, admitted he would like ""to clone"" as the template for all players.', 'After two more solid county seasons, he was selected on the England Lions tour of the West Indies in 2010, where he performed admirably and was deemed ready for the next step. He made his international debut in a T20 in Adelaide in January 2011 and kept his cool to hit the winning runs in a thrilling one-wicket victory. A few weeks later, he claimed 6 for 45 at Brisbane - the second-best figures by an Englishman in ODIs. ', 'Back in the UK, Woakes enjoyed another superb summer in first-class cricket with 56 wickets at 21.78 and 579 runs at 48.25. Most of his chances for England came with the white ball, playing spasmodically over the next couple of years, before being handed a Test debut at the end of the 2013 Ashes. He performed respectably on a flat pitch, but it was felt he lacked the pace to prosper at Test level and he was left out of the Ashes squad for the return tour to Australia. ', 'Having worked hard to add that pace, Woakes was recalled in place of Stokes in the summer of 2014 and played three Test in succession against India. He enjoyed no luck, but demonstrated the skill and control to suggest he had a future at that level. But a succession of injuries - and the development of Stokes - saw him slip back among the chasing pack and he lost his central contract at the end of 2015.', ""The summer of 2016 changed his fortunes, and his growing reputation was rewarded in 2017 by a first IPL contract. But having been expected to lead England's attack in the Champions Trophy, he instead pulled up after bowling just two overs in their opening match and missed the rest of the tournament. A difficult Ashes tour followed and he was dropped from the Test side in New Zealand - his bowling average away from home having risen to 61.77 - but he bounced back during the English summer, scoring a maiden Test century, against India at Lord's.""]","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2008, 2009,2010,2011']",26.0,43,10,1012.0,137*,30.66,2021,50.07,1,4,132,1,12.0,0.0,84.0,57,18,1039.0,95*,26.64,1149,90.42,0,4,75,16,35.0,0.0,8.0,7,4,91.0,37,30.33,63,144.44,0,0,4,5,1.0,0.0,140.0,207,48,5620,152*,35.34,,,10,23,,,59.0,0.0,162.0,106,34,1697,95*,23.56,1891,89.74,0,4,123,28,49.0,0.0,111.0,69,36,803,57*,24.33,590,136.10,0,2,65,28,41.0,0.0,26.0,48,4600,2372,72.0,6/70,11/102,32.94,3.09,63.8,2,2,1,84.0,80,3924,3669,116.0,6/45,6/45,31.62,5.61,33.8,8,2,0,8.0,8,162,253,7.0,2/40,2/40,36.14,9.37,23.1,0,0,0,140.0,245,23651,12181,474,9/36,11/97,25.69,3.09,49.8,20,19,4,162.0,155,6966,6446,190,6/45,6/45,33.92,5.55,36.6,10,2,0,111.0,108,2175,3040,121,4/21,4/21,25.12,8.38,17.9,1,0,0,False,True,False,True

Naturally competitive, willing to innovate, capable of changing a game with bat or ball, stunning run-out or implausible catch, he had much in his favour. That feisty approach, whether as a left-arm quick committed to attack or a clean-hitting left-handed batsman, first won him an international cap against Ireland in 2015 as part of an England side determined to adopt a more attacking philosophy after their flop in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. \n', 'Willey, the son of former England allrounder turned umpire Peter Willey, made his debut for Northamptonshire at the start of the 2009 season and struck a half-century on debut. Initially classed as obdurate, like his father, but with a far less unorthodox technique, he spent a few seasons of reconnaissance before his combative style began to attract attention. There had been few grittier, taciturn cricketers than his father and it was clear that that will to win had been passed down, albeit in a more freewheeling and loquacious style.', 'His bowling really developed during the 2012 season when claimed 43 first-class wickets with his brisk swing and seam. The following summer he was central to Northamptonshire\'s Friends Life t20 success with a memorable all-round performance in the final: a 19-ball half-century (the fastest of the season), a direct-hit run-out from the deep and a hat-trick to finish off the match as part of a four-wicket haul, not forgetting a slanging match with Jade Dernbach which he partly credited for his inspirational display. It was enough for his captain, Alex Wakely, to label him ""the Northants Botham.""', 'He had already been named in an England Lions squad and the chat was increasing that full international honours, especially with the white ball, would not be far away. But he had played the final part of 2013 with a sore back and after he pulled out of the England Performance Programme squad, a stress fracture was discovered; surgery on an injured shoulder followed. Talk of an England World Cup berth in Australia and New Zealand in 2015 was abruptly stilled, but the Lions wasted little time in evaluating him in 50-over cricket when he returned for Northants midway through the 2014 season, signalling that his potential was still recognised.', ""His feisty approach first won him an international cap in an experimental England side that met Ireland in Malahide in May 2015 in what turned out to be Peter Moores' last game as England coach. Further ODI and T20I opportunities followed."", ""Willey produced the performance of the 2015 season when he struck a matchwinning century against Sussex at Hove in the NatWest Blast quarter-final, including 34 off an over from the former England slow left-armer Mike Yardy as he fewll only a metre short of hitting six sixes in an over.  He destroyed Birmingham's top order in the semi-final before Lancashire overcame Northants in the final."", ""At the end of the season, he joined Yorkshire in the most headline-grabbing signing of the season, believing that he could advance his long-form game as well as galvanising Yorkshire's less-impressive limited-overs cricket. An outstanding bowling contribution in the World Twenty20 final in Kolkata brought no joy - England were pipped by West Indies in a remarkable final over - although it again emphasised his big-game talents. His switch of counties brought no immediate miracles, however: Yorkshire did reach Finals Day in the NatWest Blast in 2016, but lost in the semi-finals, Willey took only 13 Championship wickets in six matches in his first two seasons and his England limited-overs career became a strange affair as he languished deep in the batting order and rarely completed his allocation of overs; there was no place either in the 2017 Champions Trophy. A career-best 118, from 55 balls, in a T20 victory over Worcestershire at Headingley, the highest T20 score at the time by a Yorkshire batsman, was a glimpse of what the county had invested in.

He was appointed captain of Yorkshire in 2004, but it proved a disappointing year for the club, with their worst showing for 12 years, and for White himself, with just seven appearances this time. The following year was much brighter for the county, with White leading them back to the Championship's top flight, but he quit as captain at the end of 2006 after Yorkshire narrowly avoided going straight back down. \n"", ' \n']",[],30.0,50,7,1052.0,121,24.46,2437,43.16,1,5,119,12,14.0,0.0,51.0,41,5,568.0,57*,15.77,928,61.20,0,1,28,4,12.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,276.0,438,57,12395,186,32.53,,,21,62,,,167.0,0.0,362.0,323,47,7317,148,26.51,,,5,30,,,101.0,0.0,33.0,31,0,570,55,18.38,493,115.61,0,2,71,13,8.0,0.0,30.0,45,3959,2220,59.0,5/32,5/57,37.62,3.36,67.1,2,3,0,51.0,50,2364,1726,65.0,5/21,5/21,26.55,4.38,36.3,1,1,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,276.0,,21286,11260,395,8/55,,28.50,3.17,53.8,,11,0,362.0,,11581,8462,337,5/19,5/19,25.10,4.38,34.3,12,3,0,33.0,6,71,132,2,1/0,1/0,66.00,11.15,35.5,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Such was his accuracy and, for a left-arm spinner, pace - either side of medium when the ball was really biting - that when conditions favoured him an avalanche of wickets was almost guaranteed. His wizardry brought England one of the most dramatic wins in the history of Tests when, with six minutes left against Australia at The Oval in 1968, he took his fourth wicket in 27 balls. That clinched a 226-run win which squared the series, even though a lunchtime cloudburst which flooded the ground had swallowed all but 75 minutes of the last four hours. In similar circumstances at Hastings in 1973, Underwood demolished Sussex by taking 8 for 9 after a bare-footed Kent team helped the Fire Brigade mop up another flooded ground. Underwood\'s accuracy, intelligence and patience meant he was always a blessing to his captains. He adapted to conditions overseas, especially in Australia, by dropping his pace, and might have added 50-100 wickets to his England haul of 297 but for joining World Series Cricket in 1977, then the disapproved tour of South Africa in 1981-82. A game nightwatchman and a workmanlike outfielder, he was as unaffectedly pleasant at the end of his career as when, in 1963, he became the youngest bowler to take 100 wickets in his initial season. In 2008, he was unveiled as the new President of MCC on a one-year term. ', ' \n', '\nDerek Leslie Underwood was born in Bromley, Kent on June 8 1945. A left arm\nslow bowler he made his debut for Kent at age 17 and became the youngest\nplayer in history to take 100 first-class wickets in his first season. He\nachieved this feat on 9 further occasions in a county career spanning 25\nyears, and in 1966 took a remarkable 157 wickets. He was chosen for England\nagainst the West Indies, when just 21 years old and went on to play 86 tests, despite\ninterrupting his international career to play world series cricket and\nterminating it with a disapproved  trip to South Africa. His 297 Test\nwickets are included in a career total of 2465 taken at just 20 runs apiece.\nHe was awarded the MBE in 1981.', 'To describe Derek Underwood as a slow bowler, or simply a spinner is to give\na false picture of a unique performer. Much of his bowling was delivered at\na respectable medium pace, and  always off a plodding run-up of ten yards or\nso. When conditions were right he would turn the ball extravagantly, but on\ngood  pitches, against good players, he would still take plentiful wickets\nthrough his unfailing accuracy. Batsmen, infuriated or entranced by the\nunhittable length and line firing at them with the remorseless regularity of\na  bowling machine, would very often commit cricketing suicide in their\nfrustration.', 'Underwood was at his most effective on the uncovered English pitches  of\nthe sixties and early seventies. On a ""sticky dog"" the cricket slang for a\npich affected by rain he could be unplayable. Full covering failed to thwart\nhim, however, and both in county and Test cricket he maintained a high\nsuccess rate through his dedicated attention to detail. A bad delivery from\nUnderwood was a rarity and the anguish over it would be etched on his\nexpression. Although sometimes accused of bowling, a negative, flat\ntrajectory, when conditions demanded something  more flighted, Underwood\nwas a master of variations of pace and slight shifts in angle. He won\ncountless lbw victims with the ball which swung in to the right hander,\n""with the arm"".', ""Underwood's most memorable triumph of many in his long  career, was to\nretrieve the series against Australia. It had seemed hopelessly lost. The\ncircumstances of the story are extraordinary and the fact that they could\nnot be repeated now makes it a tale worth retelling."", 'It was 1968 and England captained by Colin Cowdrey had lost the first  test\nto Bill Lawry\'s Australians and then drawn the next three. Underwood, who\ndid not play in the defeat, bowled creditably in each succeeding game, but\nhis hour of glory arrived literally at the last gasp. The final Test, played\nas tradition demands at the Oval, had been dictated by England. They had\ngained a first innings lead of 170 and, although England were dismissed the\nsecond time around for 181, Australia looked doomed when they went into\nlunch on the fifth day at 86 for 5. Their salvation seemed to arrive with a\nviolent thunderstorm, which left the pitch and surrounds completely flooded.\nFurther play looked to be out of the question but when the sun appeared, the\ngroundstaff were joined by volunteers from the crowd in a frantic mopping-up\noperation. To Australia\'s dismay, the game resumed at 4.45 p.m. England had\n15 minutes plus a final, desperate hour, in which to take the 5 wickets and\nsquare the series. For 40 minutes they were denied. Then, with time and hope\nfast diminishing, D\'Olivera made the breakthrough. It was now 110 for 6.\nHalf an hour later Australia were all out for 125, Underwood having  taken\nthe remaining four wickets to clinch the victory with just 5 minutes to\nspare. Cowdrey had recalled him immediately  after the fall of the sixth\nwicket. Using the unusual conditions brilliantly, Underwood  baffled each\nbatsman in turn. Finally with every English fielder camped around the bat,\nopener John Inverarity, who had batted  through the innings for 56, played\nno shot to Underwood\'s famous inswining ""arm  ball"", and was out lbw.

It was the culmination of a five-year journey for Vaughan, whose captaincy - calm, obdurate and ruthlessly effective - had become as classy and composed as the batting technique that, briefly, carried him to the top of the world rankings.  \n', 'With a priceless ability to treat triumph and disaster just the same, Vaughan faced up to his first ball in Test cricket with England four wickets down for two runs on a damp flyer at Johannesburg in November 1999 and drew immediate comparisons with Michael Atherton for his inhumanly calm aura at the crease. But, despite the obvious similarities between the two - from their Mancunian heritage to their indifference to sledging - Vaughan soon demonstrated he was more than just a like-for-like replacement. Once he had made the place his own, Vaughan blossomed magnificently, playing with a freedom of expression that Atherton had never dared to approach. ', ""He sparkled his way to 900 runs in seven Tests against Sri Lanka and India in 2002, the prelude to a formidable series in Australia in which he became the first visiting batsman for 32 years to top 600 runs. Despite the fact that his one-day record at the time scarcely matched up to his impressive Test figures, he was appointed captain of England's one-day side in time for the 2003 home season, and inherited the Test captaincy two weeks later when Nasser Hussain abdicated out of the blue. Hussain, astutely, had spotted Vaughan's burgeoning man-management abilities, and despite a torrid baptism, including a record-breaking defeat at Lord's, Vaughan guided his team to a 2-2 draw. After a stutter in Sri Lanka, he confirmed the arrival of a new era by routing West Indies on their home soil, the first time in three decades an England team had achieved such a feat. "", 'Returning home, he missed the opening Test of the summer but returned to guide England to a summer clean sweep with victories over first New Zealand (3-0) then West Indies (4-0), went on to record a memorable 2-1 series win in South Africa, and then achieved Nirvana with a 2-1 triumph in arguably the greatest series of all time. ', ""But then came a terrible hiatus. A recurrence of an old knee injury meant that Marcus Trescothick stood in for the first Test of the post-Ashes era, in Pakistan, and the seriousness of the issue really became clear three months later in India, when he was forced home for a series of operations that wrecked his 2006 season and ensured he would not be fit to lead England's return trip to Australia. Andrew Flintoff took over the captaincy, but the calls for Vaughan's return grew louder as England were bundled ever closer to their eventual 5-0 whitewash. "", 'Vaughan was duly recalled, as captain, for the one-day series in spite of a debilitating hamstring strain that reduced him to just three appearances out of ten in a victorious CB Series campaign. He limped his way through the World Cup, in every sense of the word, becoming an increasing liability in the top order. Two months later he quit the limited-overs captaincy, but by then he had re-established himself at the helm of the Test side. ', ""He scored a memorable century on home turf at Headingley in his comeback game, before going on to overhaul Peter May's record of 20 wins as England captain. But he was never quite the same.

Yardy, whose worth in the side had been under scrutiny, had combated the illness for much of his career and as the cricket community rallied around him there was general pleasure when he returned to county cricket with Sussex in the early part of the 2011 summer. By the time he was awarded a benefit in 2014, he had spent 15 years at the county, winning seven trophies, including three Championships, and had turned himself in that time from a humdrum county professional by no means certain to make the grade to a highly-respected figure. \n"", 'His farewell season in 2015 coincided with a shock Sussex relegation from Division One of the Champion ship, but as he battled gamely - and ultimately in vain - to keep his side up, the admiration of supporters and opposition was apparent. There was a standing ovation at Hove for a century against the chamnpions Yorkshire, a farewell hundred at Hove against Somerset, and handshakes all round when he resisted again against Yorkshire at Headingley in the final match of the season. His last over in white-ball cricket - in the NatWest Blast quarter-final against Northants at Hove - went less well as David Willey struck 34 off one over and only the fact that one ball fell a yard short at midwicket stopped Yardy conceding six sixes in an over.', 'Yardy first suffered from depression when his professional satisfaction was at its peak, He had been part of the England squad that won the Twenty20 World Cup in the Caribbean in 2010 but later said: ""\'I wasn\'t enjoying life. Everything was a real struggle. I couldn\'t understand why I was in such a bad place because everything seemed to be going quite merrily from the outside. I was a World Cup winner, I was playing for a very successful England team and Sussex were playing really good Twenty20 cricket. Everything I had worked for in my professional life was going well and my family life was great and you are thinking, \'What are you doing? Snap out of it, this is ridiculous.\'""', 'Yardy\'s illness first had a direct impact upon his career when he pulled out of England\'s last one-day international against Pakistan at the Rose Bowl in September 2010. At the end of a fractious series, with revelations about Pakistani spot-fixing in full swing, nobody outside the England set-up bothered to consider why Yardy\'s Sussex team-mate Luke Wright had been preferred. He confided in England\'s coach Andy Flower and sought professional help to alleviate the illness but, like Marcus Trescothick before him, found touring with England exacerbated the problem. He would lie awake until the early hours. In Colombo, his international career - 28 ODIs and 14 T20s - came to an abrupt halt. ""I was out of my comfort zone,"" he said. ""By the last training session I was literally like a zombie.\'', ""He came back too soon and had to leave the pitch midway through a game against Middlesex at Hove, struck by a sense that he was in 'danger' on the field. But he rallied again, proving himself once more to be a dedicated and selfless captain. He relinquished the Sussex captaincy in two formats of the game in July 2013 but he continued to skipper the side in Friends Life t20, leading Sussex to their second finals day in four seasons and was also named the 1st XI Fielder of the Year, with his 34 catches across all formats rivalling numbers taken by wicketkeepers around the county circuit. He could anticipate an enthusiastically-supported benefit in 2014 after 15 years with the county.  In that time he has been the bedrock of the county during the most successful period in their history during which they have won seven trophies including three County Championships."", 'Yardy was never the most elegant player, with bat or ball, but he could be mightily effective.  A compact (stodgy in his early days) left-hander, he cemented his place by recording his maiden first-class century in defeat against Surrey, in the final match of the 2004 season. He began 2005 in identical fashion, with another hundred against Surrey, to trigger a run of form that carried him to the top of the domestic batting charts.', ""His zenith arrived against the Bangladeshis at Hove, where he scored 257 - the highest score by a Sussex batsman against a touring team, beating George Cox jr's 234 against the 1946 Indians - and followed up with a career-best 5 for 83 with his flat, left-arm spin, having started life as a medium-pacer. That was exactly double his previous tally of first-class wickets. It proved to be an effective career move."", ""His good form continued throughout the 2005 season leading to selection for the England A tour of West Indies, and ultimately a chance to push for a World Cup place when he was picked for the Champions Trophy. Though his bowling impressed, England's strange insistence that he bat at No. 4 meant that the overall image suffered, and he was quietly jettisoned. He was groomed as Chris Adams' success at Hove and took the reins in 2009, leading the county to two one-day trophies - the Twenty20 Cup and Pro40 - but also presided over Championship relegation."", 'His steely approach in one-day cricket, however, kept the England selectors interested and when Flower recognised the need for the limited-overs side to find a left-arm spinning allrounder Yardy was recalled for the 2010 World Twenty20. Darting the ball in, he formed a potent spin partnership with Graeme Swann that helped England achieve their first ever success in a global ICC event. That secured him a regular place during the 2010 season and then a berth at the World Cup where his problems were to mount once more.', '\n']",[],0.0,,,0.0,,17.69,,,,,,,,,28.0,24,8,326.0,60*,20.37,472,69.06,0,2,20,1,10.0,0.0,14.0,8,5,96.0,35*,32.00,72,133.33,0,0,9,1,8.0,0.0,193.0,320,27,10693,257,36.49,,,23,50,,,184,0,209.0,178,31,3677,98*,25.01,,,0,23,,,75.0,0.0,126.0,94,33,1250,76*,20.49,1214,102.96,0,2,104,12,39.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,35.33,,,,,,28.0,28,1332,1075,21.0,3/24,3/24,51.19,4.84,63.4,0,0,0,14.0,13,276,299,11.0,2/19,2/19,27.18,6.5,25.0,0,0,0,193.0,,3675,2192,29,5/83,,75.58,3.57,126.7,,1,0,209.0,,6408,5474,141,6/27,6/27,38.82,5.12,45.4,3,1,0,126.0,112,2397,2710,100,3/21,3/21,27.10,6.78,23.9,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

After an accomplished career as a tight and testing white-ball operator, he suffered a series of serious knee injuries and, despite coming back for New South Wales, was cut from Australia's contract list in April. He vowed to continue fighting. \n"", ""Tall and slim, Bracken moves the ball both ways in the air and off the seam and fitted easily into Australia's rampant one-day squad in 2000-01. He was also instrumental in resuscitating New South Wales' fortunes, including a first-innings 6 for 27 in their 2004-05 final win over Queensland and 7 for 4 earlier that season when South Australia fell for 29. A shoulder injury cut short his maiden Ashes tour in 2001 after two matches, but following a spell on the sidelines he returned to the national set-up during the 2003 World Cup, when Jason Gillespie dropped out with a heel injury. "", ""His Test debut finally came in 2003-04, but in three outings against the powerful Indian batting line-up he failed to make real inroads. In 2004 he was omitted from Cricket Australia's list of contracted players, but returned to the ODI scene for the 2005 Super Series and became a regular in green and gold. Work in the nets refining his swing was rewarded with two Tests in 2005-06 and he also added another string by delivering across the seam when he wanted to defend. "", 'The versatility and control led to 46 ODI wickets for 2006, the second most in the world, and at times during the 2006 Champions Trophy he opened the attack, dropping Glenn McGrath to first change. In 17 matches between the South Africa tour and the end of the CB Series he picked up at least a wicket in each game and he missed only one match at the World Cup, capturing 16 victims in his second campaign. ', 'His steady rise peaked after the 2008 West Indies tour when he became the No. 1-ranked one-day bowler, his 34 wickets in the previous home contest boosting his ratings. The West Indies series was also an important step following what could have been a career-ending knee injury. He required surgery and when the doctor scraped away the cartilage it was like ""old paint peeling off a wall"". ', ""In 2008-09 Australia raided the fast-bowling cupboards without calling on Bracken to assist in the five-day team's revival, a course of events reported in detail most Sundays by a Sydney tabloid. The rest of the country wasn't in shock, knowing Bracken's strengths lie in containing rampant limited-overs batsmen with his clever variations of pace and length.

At his retirement he had featured in more Tests, more consecutive Tests, more Tests as captain and more catches than any other player - and a batting average of 50 as well.

He was not always the most stylish player, but for what he lacked in fluency he more than compensated with his ardour for occupying the crease and accumulating runs when they were most needed. As an 18 year old, Boon played a starring role in Tasmania's history-making Gillette Cup win in 1978-79, the state's first interstate one-day title, and he never really looked back over the course of an elite-level career which spanned 17 years. Among many highlights were his roles in four Ashes series wins, particularly the 1989 triumph and his honour in hitting the series-winning runs; his flawless unbeaten 184 in the Bicentenary Test of 1988; and his Man-of-the-Match winning effort in the 1987 World Cup final. Predominantly in the No. 3 position, Boon's durability was a vital ingredient in Australia's resurgence as a cricketing power in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His courage was often at the core of Australian performances and it was common to see his belligerent square cutting, driving and pulling upsetting the rhythm of even the finest of bowlers.  \n"", 'Aside from a range of triumphs with Australia during 107 Tests and 181 ODIs, Boon also led Durham in the English County Championship between 1997 and 1999, guiding the side to its best finish in the last of these three years. He was also appointed to the post of Tasmania captain at different ends of his career and was at the helm when his state enjoyed a fruitful first-class season in 1997-98. After retiring from all cricket following the completion of the 1999 county program, Boon accepted a position in marketing with the Tasmanian Cricket Association in Hobart and in 2000 replaced Geoff Marsh, his mate and former opening partner, as an Australia selector. In 2011, he took a new step as an ICC match referee, with his first fixture coming in Bulawayo, where Zimbabwe took on Pakistan.

Instead he performed for Hampshire that winter - he also appeared for Worcestershire and Essex - and the promotion never came. "", ""During his international career Bichel spent a lot of time coming in and going out of the squad but rarely stopped smiling. A prolific 12th man, he played 19 Tests for 58 wickets from his gutsy fast bowling and posted a half-century against West Indies, a team he always seemed to lift for.

""It was one of those perfect days,"" he said. Bichel also top scored for Australia with a vital half-century against New Zealand and finished the tournament with 16 wickets at 12.31 and 117 runs.

An essential part of the one-day outfit for a decade, especially when orchestrating calm chases in crises that often ended in last-over or last-ball heroics, he was cut from the contract list with two World Cup wins and kitbags full of highlights. He will long be remembered for his pair of sensational innings against West Indies at Sydney in 1996 and New Zealand at Melbourne in 2002, when nerveless batting and juggling of the tail secured nail-biting victories. Picking the gaps, running hard and knowing the right moment - and place - to hit a boundary were the hallmarks of his success. He was also a fine fieldsman and his left-arm wrist spin, which swung from erratic to more than useful, added to his lure and allowed him to play Tests as a batting allrounder.  \n"", 'Bevan enjoyed a promising start to his Test career with 82 in his debut innings and another two half-centuries in his first series against Pakistan in 1994-95, but he managed only a stop-start four-year campaign and was hindered by an inability to play the short ball at the highest level, which was strange as he had few problems with it in Australian or English domestic cricket. He never made a century, although he was twice unbeaten in the 80s when batting down the order and running out of partners against West Indies, who he upset with 15 wickets in the 1997-98 series. After that his Test career slid, but while he lost his baggy green he worked on making unforgettable memories in the green and gold one-day uniform, finishing with 232 appearances and a phenomenal average of 53.58 that was boosted by six centuries, 46 fifties and 67 not outs.', 'Born in Canberra, Bevan made his first-class debut in 1989-90 in South Australian colours, hitting a thrilling century in his first innings, before the completion of a 12-month stint at the Academy led to a move back to New South Wales. It was in Sydney that he began to make his greatest strides as a player, quickly assuming a regular middle-order berth in the strongest state team in the country and, aside from a poor run in 1992-93 which resulted in a brief omission, using it as a launching pad to the national team. Shortly after being cut by the Australian selectors - Trevor Hohns said his ""contribution to the one-day side had decreased"" - he signed a two-year deal with Tasmania and proved his days of domination were not finished when he struck a domestic record 1464 runs in the Pura Cup, including eight centuries. He was named the Pura Cup Player of the Year and his Bradmanesque scoring achieved an average of 97.60, but there was no return to the international arena and no sign of him being included for the 2007 World Cup. After a disrupted summer following a knee operation, he made brief appearances for Tasmania in 2005-06 and 2006-07.

If that seems a contradiction, consider that Bailey went from uncapped to captain with nothing in between. Australia were searching for a new leader of their Twenty20 side and the Tasmanian Bailey was one of the most respected state skippers, and was thrust into the role to replace Cameron White. It made him the first man since Dave Gregory in the first Test match in 1877 to be named captain in his debut for Australia in any format. Over the next couple of years Bailey worked his way into Australia's team in all three forms of the game, and was part of the unchanged XI that delivered an Ashes whitewash in 2013-14. \n"", ""\nHowever, while he made contributions in the Test team and T20 side, it was as an ODI batsman that Bailey shone brightest. A destructive striker capable of changing a match within a few overs, Bailey enjoyed an especially prolific ODI year in 2013 and at his peak was ranked the No.2 ODI batsman in the world. He was also frequently used as a stand-in captain in the one-day side and led Australia at the start of the 2015 World Cup, when Michael Clarke was injured. One of the most respected men in Australian cricket, Bailey was viewed as a mature and adaptable captain, and led Australia in two World T20 campaigns before resigning the T20 captaincy in 2014 to focus on ODIs and playing more first-class cricket. A native of Launceston, Bailey is the great-great-grandson of George Herbert Bailey, who was part of Australia's 1878 touring squad to England.""]",['Australian One-Day International Player of the Year - 2014'],5.0,8,1,183.0,53,26.14,311,58.84,0,1,15,8,10,0,90.0,85,10,3044.0,156,40.58,3645,83.51,3,22,222,57,48.0,0.0,30.0,26,7,473.0,63,24.89,346,136.7,0,2,37,20,10.0,0.0,156.0,276,21,9894,200*,38.80,18152,54.50,24,51,,,133,0,268.0,250,28,8242,156,37.12,9698,84.98,11,53,,,122.0,0.0,199.0,179,44,3954,89*,29.28,3023,130.79,0,23,334,116,83.0,0.0,5.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,90.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,30.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,156.0,,97,55,0,-,-,-,3.40,-,0,0,0,268.0,,53,40,1,1/19,1/19,40.00,4.52,53.0,0,0,0,199.0,1,12,24,0,-,-,-,12.00,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

At his peak Clarke was ranked the best Test batsman in the world, testament not only to his skill but his hard work in overcoming a chronic back injury that caused him progressively more trouble as his career advanced. Also an intuitive, aggressive captain, Clarke took over from Ricky Ponting in 2011 and while the team did not always run harmoniously during his tenure, he was at the helm for an Ashes whitewash in 2013-14 and a World Cup triumph in 2015. His retirement came at the end of a lost Ashes campaign in England in 2015, but he could be satisfied with a career punctuated by fine achievements. \n"", ""As a young man Clarke could do anything with the bat, but he matured into one of the game's most professional, reliable and focussed players. A year into his Test career he learnt that he had to shed the flourishes that made him a golden child in order to shine consistently at elite level. Breathtaking centuries on debut away and at home stamped him as a shot-maker to savour, but his method in later years was to find gaps by caressing the ball along the ground. In the field his throw was as fast and accurate as anything in the game, and he could winkle out batsmen with his disarming left-arm spin. "", 'Mostly he became known for his immaculate driving and slicing of the ball through impossible angles. His peak year was 2012, which brought 1595 runs at 106.33 and stamped him as the most in-form batsman in the world. The year began with a monumental 329 not out against India at the SCG and continued with 210 in Adelaide, where he joined Wally Hammond and Don Bradman as the only men to score a triple-century and a double-hundred in the same series. Later in the year came back-to-back double-centuries against South Africa in Brisbane and Adelaide. There seemed little he could not do.', ""But the team harmony disintegrated on the tour of India that followed in 2013, when Clarke and coach Mickey Arthur suspended four players in what became known as the homework saga. The Ashes series in England was then lost, but Clarke's Australians regained the urn with a 5-0 clean sweep in Australia at the end of the year. Clarke's gutsy century in Cape Town in 2014, completed with a broken shoulder thanks to a bouncer barrage from Morne Morkel, led to Australia's return to No.1, if only temporarily. Later in the year a statesmanlike Clarke led the country in mourning the death of his close friend Phillip Hughes, and an emotional century in Adelaide followed in what Clarke called the most important match of his career."", ""Although Clarke's ability and dedication could never be questioned, he nevertheless struggled at times to win over sections of the public, due in part to his A-list celebrity status, large endorsements and high-profile private life. There were occasions when he was booed in his own country, and at times he was accused of being too aloof around the team environment. But whatever his off-field status, Clarke will be remembered as a batsman of class and a captain who took the game on, and emerged with an enviable record in both spheres.\n"", '\n']","['Allan Border Medal - 2005, 2009, 2012, 2013', 'Australian Test Player of the Year - 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014', 'ICC Cricketer of the Year 2013', 'ICC Test Player of the Year 2013']",115.0,198,22,8643.0,329*,49.1,15456,55.92,28,27,978,39,134,0,245.0,223,44,7981.0,130,44.58,10104,78.98,8,58,665,53,106.0,0.0,34.0,28,5,488.0,67,21.21,473,103.17,0,1,29,10,13.0,0.0,188.0,327,33,13826,329*,47.02,,,45,48,,,203,0,313.0,285,52,9905,130,42.51,12582,78.72,9,73,,,132.0,0.0,46.0,40,5,737,67,21.05,681,108.22,0,1,57,12,18.0,0.0,115.0,65,2435,1184,31.0,6/9,6/9,38.19,2.91,78.5,0,2,0,245.0,106,2585,2146,57.0,5/35,5/35,37.64,4.98,45.3,1,1,0,34.0,15,156,225,6.0,1/2,1/2,37.50,8.65,26.0,0,0,0,188.0,,3627,1886,42,6/9,,44.90,3.11,86.3,,2,0,313.0,,3295,2689,84,5/35,5/35,32.01,4.89,39.2,1,1,0,46.0,24,273,368,9,1/2,1/2,40.88,8.08,30.3,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

He fitted in perfectly in his opening appearances - he replaced McGrath, who was caring for his sick wife - and at the age of 30 experienced a dream start as the Player of the Series with 20 wickets at 15.75 against South Africa. A gamble for the first game at Cape Town, he collected his baggy green and earned his side a victory with 5 for 55 and 4 for 34, the third-best match figures by an Australian debutant behind Bob Massie and Clarrie Grimmett.  \n', ""His home welcome was equally impressive as he helped up-end England with his extra lift, gained from his 197cm height, and regular seam movement. An uncomfortable prospect, especially early in a spell, he picked up 26 wickets at 17 in the Ashes to show there was life for Australia's bowling contingent after McGrath. Clark captured at least one victim in all ten innings against England and missed out only once in his opening nine Tests. Just when England thought they had left their Clark nightmares behind he popped up at Hampshire on a short-term visit and broke Michael Vaughan's hand. "", ""While Clark quickly became a fixture in the longer form, he was dropped from the one-day team during that season's CB Series and was considered too expensive for a 2007 World Cup berth. He vowed to improve his control and won a Caribbean reprieve when Brett Lee turned his ankle in New Zealand. There was one game against Ireland and he did not disappoint in more intermittent appointments, finishing with 39 ODI caps. After 34 Test wickets were added to his collection at an average of 26.52 against Sri Lanka, India and West Indies in 2007-08, his hold on a Test place became less secure. He was dropped in India in 2008 before struggling with an elbow injury at home, the surgery ruling him out of both series against South Africa. "", ""Called for the one-day tournament against Pakistan, he made a steady return in the United Arab Emirates instead of delivering long spells in the County Championship in preparation for the Ashes tour. He played two games in the defeat and started strongly at Leeds, but was unable to make an impact after being preferred to Nathan Hauritz at The Oval. He hasn't retired from internationals, but the rest of his career will be spent at New South Wales, who he captained either side of a back injury in 2009-10."", 'A former real-estate agent in Sydney who crams study for a masters degree in commerce, Clark had to wait to strike the right market after a battle with his body as much as his talent. Clark held a Cricket Australia contract after a 45-wicket season in 2001-02 before losing it a summer later when struck by ankle and rib injuries. Hernia surgery was next on the list followed quickly by a leg problem, but he collected 40 breakthroughs in 2004-05 to re-impress Trevor Hohns and his selection gang. ', 'While on a guest stint at Middlesex, Clark was called up as a squad replacement for the Ashes tour, although he did not get a playing opportunity. He made his ODI debut during the 2005 Super Series and was a sound limited-overs performer in his first summer.

The following year, Finch was named Australia's T20 captain to replace George Bailey, but on the eve of the 2016 World T20 in India the selectors decided to consolidate the captaincy of all three formats and handed the job to Steven Smith. Finch at the time was the No.1-ranked T20 international batsman in the world, but found himself suddenly struggling to hold on to his place in the side.

Victoria did not always view Finch as being in their preferred Sheffield Shield batting order, and nearly three years came between his second and third first-class centuries from 2011 to 2014. He piled on an unbeaten 288 against New Zealand in a tour match in Blacktown in 2015-16, although that match was ultimately abandoned as the New Zealanders complained about the condition of the pitch.', ""Finch remained an in-demand T20 cricketer and in 2016 joined the Gujarat Lions, his sixth IPL franchise.

Also like Michael, Hussey has been forced to pile up mountains of runs in Australia before gaining the confidence of the national selectors. It took his first 1000-run season in 2007-08 before he was finally chosen for a tour, the ODI series in the West Indies in 2008, and earned his first Cricket Australia contract. Earlier in that summer he made his Twenty20 international debut against India at the MCG. Hussey was one of the big surprises in the Indian Premier League auction when Kolkata paid $625,000 to secure him - far more than the sums offered for his brother and Ricky Ponting. Over the next couple of years he was a regular in Australia's Twenty20 team and a fringe ODI player. In 2009-10, Hussey topped the Sheffield Shield run tally with 970 at 57.05, including 168 in the final as he helped Victoria raise the trophy with victory over Queensland. But within a month Hussey had lost his CA contract as the selectors looked to younger men. \n"", ""Despite his crash-and-bash style, Hussey is desperate not to be pigeon-holed as a Twenty20 player, although that appears to be where his international future lies. Still, he has been a standout first-class player in county cricket and for Victoria; only Simon Katich made more runs than him in the 2007-08 Sheffield Shield campaign. He only made two centuries and his best was 104 but his consistency was remarkable. Equally impressive was his 484 FR Cup runs at 44, including a 60-ball century - the second-fastest in Australia's domestic one-day history - that featured eight sixes. It was no surprise when Hussey was named Victoria's Player of the Year in all three formats. He had come off a prolific season at Nottinghamshire, where he made 1219 runs at 93.76, including 275 from 227 balls against Essex. The next summer he struggled in the Sheffield Shield before making an important century in the final win, and he held on to his national contract. That was soon followed by a brutal 88 from 44 balls in a Twenty20 international in Johannesburg, and his maiden ODI century came against Scotland in August 2009. "", 'An aggressive batsman with a strong bottom-hand technique, Hussey hit a breathtaking, breakthrough 212 not out at nearly a run a ball in 2003-04, which was his first full-time season at first-class level. The innings came as Victoria chased a record-breaking 455 for a Pura Cup victory in Newcastle and Steve Waugh, the opposing captain, was impressed. The summer ended with 857 runs at 61 and was quickly followed by 1208 county runs in 2004. Repeating the local haul was difficult and despite starring for Australia A in one-day games - he hit a century against West Indies and a fifty against Pakistan - he was unable to hold his Pura Cup spot. The unhappy Hussey wanted a release to return to Western Australia, where he had played under-19 and 2nd XI games, but Cricket Victoria insisted he stay. Arriving in Nottingham he immediately fixed a minor technical problem and went on to gorge 1231 runs with a high of 232 not out as the county won the Championship. Another solid effort at Nottinghamshire in 2006 - he made 1103 runs at 50.13 - preceded his state-topping 911 Pura Cup runs at 53.58 in 2006-07, when he scored centuries in three consecutive matches.

His cool head under pressure has won matches for Australia many times, and notably he was Man of the Match in the 2015 World Cup final triumph over New Zealand. On that occasion it was his bowling that earned him the honour, his 3 for 36 restricting New Zealand to a very gettable 183. His variations - slow balls and cutters especially - make him a dangerous bowler in the short forms and against Pakistan at the 2016 World T20 he became the first Australian to take a five-wicket haul in a T20 international. Faulkner made his Test debut in the dead rubber at The Oval on the 2013 Ashes tour and claimed six wickets, but has struggled to squeeze back into the side since then. Later that year he plundered his first ODI century - 116 off 73 balls - in a loss to India in Bangalore, in a game that will be more remembered for Rohit Sharma's 209. At domestic level, Faulkner was Tasmania's best player during a period of great success for the state. His breakout season in 2010-11 - he collected 36 Sheffield Shield wickets at 17.72 - coincided with the Tigers winning the Shield for the second time. The following two summers brought the consistent Faulkner wicket tallies of 36 and 39 and he helped the Tigers reach the Shield final in 2011-12 and win it in 2012-13 - he was Man of the Match in that final. His importance for Tasmania during those three seasons cannot be underestimated and in 2012-13 he won his third consecutive Ricky Ponting Medal as Tasmania's best player. Faulkner, whose father Peter also played for Tasmania, signed with his fourth IPL team - Gujarat Lions - for the 2016 season.

A crowd favourite, he was a lively character armed with an imposing run-up and delivery action, a classic fast bowlers' glare down the pitch, a mischievous sense of humour and a moustache of incredible proportions. And while his antics sometimes overshadowed his bowling, Hughes gave every ounce of effort to his country, and helped it to re-climb the ranks of Test cricket. Hughes made a comparatively modest entrance in the mid-1980s, but his value came to the fore against West Indies in 1988-89, when he lost pace partner Geoff Lawson to a broken jaw in the second Test. Hughes gained a hat-trick in that match, but his performance - 13 for 217 off 73.1 overs - illustrated his ability to combine the roles of spearhead and stock bowler.  \n"", ""By the mid-point of his international career, Hughes had improved his accuracy and variation and was using his bouncer, which remained a favourite throughout his career, with greater discretion. After ducks in his first three Test innings, he also become a handy batsman - albeit one who favoured a powerful, tail-enders' hoick over midwicket - and had a top score of 72 against the mighty West Indians of 1988-89. Hughes saved his greatest series performance for the 1993 Ashes tour, when bowling partner Craig McDermott was ruled out with a twisted bowel. Over the six Tests, Hughes took 31 wickets from almost 300 overs, helping Australia to a 4-1 victory. "", ""Hughes sustained a serious knee injury during the series and made only a fleeting Test comeback the following summer, finishing with 212 career wickets. However, his enthusiasm for the game continued long after his international days. He appeared for the Canberra Comets during their experiment against the states in domestic one-day cricket, and became a veteran of his local club Footscray in Melbourne. A host of supporters' tours, he made the surprise step into high-level administration when he replaced Allan Border as an Australian selector in 2005.

Not that he was a reactionary or relic; on the contrary, he was a savvy media performer and an innovative coach. But he had throughout his career a breezy confidence that recalled days when cricket was a more spontaneous and flamboyant affair. \n', ""It was while indulging in the oldest of Australia rites, the post-match drink, that Hookes was killed in circumstances still shocking in their senselessness, by a bouncer's gratuitous punch, on January 19, aged 48. Typically, he had been in the company of players both from his current state, Victoria, and his former state, South Australia, after an ING Cup game - a habit ingrained when he made his debut at Adelaide 28 years ago."", 'It was in his second season that Hookes, barely 21, first grabbed attention, harvesting five Sheffield Shield centuries from six innings, including centuries in both innings in consecutive games - a feat accomplished only once before, 70 years earlier, by Surrey\'s Tom Hayward. ""Heck!"" trumpeted Australia\'s Cricketer magazine. ""It\'s Hookes!"" Today, he might have had to prove his consistency over a longer course; then, he was at once slotted into Australia\'s middle-order for March 1977\'s Centenary Test with Greg Chappell and Doug Walters, where his five consecutive fours from Tony Greig\'s off-spin is among the most treasured cameos. ""I made Tony Greig famous,"" he once said drolly.', ""In that moment, too, Hookes became the face of Australia's cricket future. A blond, broad-shouldered, loose-limbed left-hander, Hookes was chased by the agents of Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket not merely for his cricketing gifts but his marketing potential. Despite having played but a single Test, he was advanced two-thirds of his fee rather than the half that others received: the new matinee needed a heart-throb."", ""Hookes's WSC years were contented ones: his 770 runs at 38.50 from a dozen SuperTests made him Australia's third-highest scorer after the Chappell brothers. He was also part of the enterprise's most dramatic moments when, after a testosterone-soaked assault on the bowling of Joel Garner and Michael Holding at the Sydney Showground, he had his jaw shattered by a bouncer from Andy Roberts in December 1977. Until that moment, WSC had looked suspiciously like a thrown-together entertainment package; Hookes' injury impressed the contest's intensity on all observers."", 'Hookes was in a prime position to secure a berth in Australia\'s middle-order when the WSC players were re-assimilated into official cricket in May 1979, but a knee injury and a calamitous tour of Pakistan where he scored 10 runs in six first-class innings queered his pitch. By December 1980, he was not even playing for South Australia. But, awarded the captaincy 10 months later, he led the state to a Sheffield Shield. ""I had to grow up,"" he explained, ""and I did.""', ""In one free-swinging summer, 1982-83, Hookes scored 1,424 runs at 64.72, which he followed with his only Test century, an unbeaten 143 in Australia's inaugural Test against Sri Lanka at Kandy. It was as good as the going got for Hookes at international level. He was back in state ranks by next summer following a miserable Australian performance at the World Cup, and after a last recall three years later was considered spent as an international force."", 'In truth, Hookes had always been a first-class destroyer of second-rate bowling - something about which he had few delusions. ""I have much to be modest about,"" he said at the start of his autobiography Hookesy. ""I suspect history will judge me harshly as a batsman because of my modest record in 23 Tests and I can\'t complain about that."" It was in Sheffield Shield cricket, and especially at the Adelaide Oval with its short square boundaries, that he was most destructive. He set records there for speed, as in his century from 34 balls against Victoria in October 1982, and scale, with an unbeaten 306 in an undefeated fourth-wicket stand of 462 with Wayne Phillips against Tasmania four years later.', 'Like his first skipper Ian Chappell, Hookes never courted officialdom, and was sacked as South Australia\'s skipper in August 1990 after eight seasons. Playing three more, he built his domestic run pile to a record 9,364. But by then he could see his future. He shrank from an administrative career - explaining ""I don\'t have a blue blazer and I haven\'t got dandruff"" - and gravitated towards radio which he tackled with both a sense of fun and spirit of commitment.', ""In September 1995, Hookes relocated to Melbourne, where his Sports Today on station 3AW with former Aussie Rules footballer Gerard Healy became required listening for aficionados. It was Hookes, for example, who in December 1998 foreshadowed the revelation that Shane Warne and Mark Waugh had accepted money from a bookmaker in Sri Lanka. Yet because Hookes was always impressively himself, the reckless abandon with which he sometimes expressed his views was often endearing: Warne, indeed, was among those who pressed for Hookes' appointment as Victoria's coach in May 2002."", ""Hookes tackled the task with impressive zeal, pensioning off experienced players like Damien Fleming and Colin Miller, and investing in youth and vitality. Victoria, last a domestic first-class title winner in 1990-91, led the Pura Cup and were second in the ING Cup at the time of Hookes' death. One or both trophies would be a fitting memorial, although Hookes' legacy is already considerable.""]","[""Victoria's coach 2002-03 to 2003-04"", 'Information on the David Hookes Foundation is available ']",23.0,41,3,1306.0,143*,34.36,,,1,8,147,5,12,0,39.0,36,2,826.0,76,24.29,1146,72.07,0,5,73,13,11.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,178.0,304,16,12671,306*,43.99,,,32,65,,,167,0,82.0,78,4,2041,101,27.58,,,1,11,,,37.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.0,7,96,41,1.0,1/4,1/4,41.0,2.56,96.0,0,0,0,39.0,3,29,28,1.0,1/2,1/2,28.0,5.79,29.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,178.0,,4290,2379,41,3/58,,58.02,3.32,104.6,,0,0,82.0,,591,502,15,5/41,5/41,33.46,5.09,39.4,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

He announced himself to the world with a stupendous flipper to Zimbabwe's Andy Flower in the 2003 World Cup. Flower leapt back, waited for the away-spin and then slumped, hideously bamboozled, as the ball fizzed straight through on to his stumps. Until that moment, Hogg's cricketing trajectory had been anything but straightforward. Like Stuart MacGill, he had spent years in the shadow of Shane Warne. He went to that World Cup hoping to pick Warne's brain, and unexpectedly found himself filling Warne's boots. His initial Test opportunity, at Delhi way back in 1996, also arose as Warne's stand-in. He made 1 and 4, took 1 for 69, and was promptly dumped for the next seven years and 78 games. No other Australian has waited so long between his first and second Tests; Alan Hurst, dropped for 30 matches, was the previous record-holder.  \n"", 'During his time in the wilderness, Hogg learned to practise less and enjoy himself more. He began first-class life as a solid left-hand batsman, before flirting with chinamen in the nets one afternoon at the playful suggestion of his Western Australia coach Tony Mann. His batting has fallen away, although he hit a Pura Cup century in 2004-05, but his jack-in-a-box fielding makes up for it. Hogg used to be a postman - ""I do my round like a Formula One driver,"" he once bragged - and has the ever-present smile of a postie who\'s never known yappy dogs or rainy days. ', ""Claiming the Man-of-the-Series award against Bangladesh, Hogg passed 100 ODI wickets in April 2006, but was used strangely at home the following season after playing in the final of the Champions Trophy. Called on only once during the CB Series preliminary rounds, he was even released for domestic matches and seemed to be on the verge of exiting the national set-up. Cameron White's disappointing bowling turned the selectors back to Hogg, who then failed to get a wicket in the next five games. However, instead of being a World Cup passenger, he suddenly headed for the cockpit for an incredible journey. Batsmen found choosing a Caribbean bar easier than picking Hogg's tricky menu and he created as much destruction as Murali. Twenty-one wickets at 15.80 sparked many more smiles but he again struggled when given chances in the Test series against India, his eight wickets costing almost 60 apiece. Nevertheless, his decision to retire at the end of the 2007-08 summer caught many on the hop."", 'His decision to come back was just as surprising. After a brief stint as a commentator, he returned to play grade cricket in Perth. That led to a surprise call-up for the Perth Scorchers in the 2012 BBL, and his child-like enthusiasm led to a recall, at 40, to the national Twenty20 squad against India in 2011-12.

It was not an adequate reward for one of the most prolific run scorers in the modern era of Australia's domestic game. \n"", ""By the time the 2009-10 season arrived, Hodge's heart was no longer in first-class cricket. He began the summer with 195 against South Australia but had an epiphany when he had reached his century, stumps was near and he launched the new ball over the bowler's head for six. Hodge said it signified he no longer had the drive to play the longer format and he soon retired, although he announced he would stay on in Victoria's limited-overs teams for another two seasons.

In the Caribbean, he finally reached three figures with 123 off 89 balls against the Netherlands, but it was his last bat in the tournament and he watched the final from the dressing room. It had become an all-too familiar viewing platform. Hodge was Australia's unluckiest casualty of the 2005-06 season of batting change.

Included in his five outings was an unbeaten 203 against South Africa in Perth, where he joined his boyhood idol Dean Jones as one of five Australians to make their maiden century a double. Two Tests later, Hodge, a tiny right-hander who is more quiet and laid back than Jones, was dropped amid whispers of a technical flaw against fast bowling, a short drought in the Pura Cup and a selection ""judgment call"". He picked himself up with a century in the domestic final loss to Queensland but remained on the fringes of the national side, making occasional one-day and Twenty20 appearances. He held on to his Cricket Australia contract until 2009-10, but was never viewed by the selectors as anything but a back-up plan.

The following years were more difficult, but he returned from the dips as a more complete player, carrying a classical technique and the ability to direct shots to all parts of the ground. Around consistently impressive one-day returns, Hodge passed the 1000 barrier in the 2000-01 first-class summer when he was a key player in the Bushrangers' march to a second successive Pura Cup final. More of the same output was revealed in 2001-02, when he shared the domestic Player-of-the-Season award with Queensland's Jimmy Maher, and his consistency pushed him towards international honours.

Back in England for the Pakistan series, his eight wickets in the two games were no surprise, but his 56 not out at Lord's was."", 'Hilfenhaus was able to lay down his trowel after a series of dramatic performances in his first two seasons catapulted him to a national contract in 2007. Two years earlier, Hilfenhaus was earning money on a building site, but his ability to shape the ball away at 140kph earned a six-figure pay packet. ""It has been a fast ride,"" he said after picking up the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year prize in February 2007. A month earlier he represented Australia for the first time in a one-day international on his home ground at Hobart, taking only 12 balls to get his maiden wicket when he trapped Brendon McCullum. ', ""A strong and fit man from Ulverstone in northern Tasmania, Hilfenhaus is only the second fast bowler from the state to play for Australia after Greg Campbell, Ricky Ponting's uncle. While shaping the ball away is his specialty, he can also angle it in and his repertoire was crucial to the Tigers' maiden Pura Cup victory in 2006-07. Hilfenhaus' 60 wickets at 25.38, the third most in the competition's history, included three five-wicket hauls, but his back-breaking workload means he is always an injury candidate. He delivered 509.1 overs in the first-class arena that summer, nearly 200 more than any of his domestic fast-bowling counterparts. His collection of 28 wickets at 43.82 in 2007-08 was not the follow-up campaign he wanted but the selectors showed faith and chose him in Australia's Test squad to visit the West Indies in 2008, although he was later ruled out due to a recurrence of stress fractures in his back. "", 'In his opening season Hilfenhaus quickly built a strong reputation and after 39 wickets at 30.82 was named in the Australia A squad for the Top End series. A former national under-19 representative, he also accepted an invitation to return to the Academy after first attending the facility when it was based in Adelaide in 2002.

It was a rare treat for Gillespie, who played only 52 of a possible 92 Tests after his 1996-97 debut thanks to an assortment of ailments: busted feet, stress fractures in the back, hip twinges, side strains, dicky shoulders, torn calves, aching hamstrings, groin complaints and a broken right leg. Each time he recovered and until being dropped during the 2005 Ashes he had missed only two Tests since November 2002. Through it all, in partnership with Glenn McGrath, he blossomed into one half of Australia's most statistically successful opening pair ever. \nBut if McGrath's strength was his ability to make the ball do just enough, then Gillespie's flaw is his tendency for it to do too much. No other contemporary fast man has elicited so many plays-and-misses. It explains, perhaps, along with his slightly samey length, why Gillespie never quite imposed himself as Australia's No. 1 strike bowler. Nor has he truly dominated an opposition line-up; remarkably, the most wickets he has taken in a single series is 20. Operating from a shorter reconfigured run-up, he is not so consistently quick and in England Michael Vaughan treated Australia's fifth most successful bowler like a medium-pacer.  \n"", 'However, few Australian fast men can have owned such deep wells of tenacity. Gillespie bowls long spells in the hottest conditions - always uncomplainingly, and always with the seam upright and the ball jagging both ways - and he showed the trait again when he promised to return to the national team and memorably achieved his aim against Bangladesh. He collected eight wickets in the two-match series, taking his Test tally to 259 while McGrath, Kasprowicz and Tait were missing, but his unforgettable moment came over 574 minutes and 425 balls. His maiden century was a magnificent, unbeaten 201 that was easily the highest score by a nightwatchman. ', 'He is popular with team-mates and bashful with the public. He watches wrestling, listens to heavy metal and celebrated his first Test fifty with a bat ride embellished from the movie ', "". He was more restrained while clocking off unthinkable milestones at Chittagong and it was appropriate recognition for a hardy and valuable batting approach that has also produced two unbeaten half-centuries and a priceless 26, which sealed a hard-fought draw against India in 2004-05. A second first-class century came in 2007 at Yorkshire shortly before he retained his Cricket Australia contract. Throughout the previous home season he was certain he wouldn't be rewarded, but his 30 Pura Cup wickets at 28.43 helped him to sneak into the squad as experienced back-up, ending the idea of him moving states. With no chance of a recall, he announced his retirement from first-class cricket during the 2007-08 season and signed a three-year contract with the unofficial Indian Cricket League.

He was simultaneously a cheerful throwback to more innocent times, a flap-eared country boy who walked when given not out in a World Cup semi-final, and swatted his second ball for six while sitting on a Test pair. ""Just hit the ball,"" is how he once described his philosophy on batting, and he seldom strayed from it. Employing a high-on-the-handle grip, he poked good balls into gaps and throttled most others, invariably with head straight, wrists soft and balance sublime. Only at the death did he jettison the textbook, whirling his bat like a hammer-thrower, caring only for the scoreboard and never his average. Still he managed to score at a tempo - 81 per 100 balls in Tests, 96 in one-dayers - that made Viv Richards and Gilbert Jessop look like stick-in-the-muds.  \n', ""When he signed a record A$2m sponsorship deal with Puma in 2004, few people questioned his value for money. Indeed it was arguably Gilchrist's belated Test arrival that turned the Australian XI from powerful to overpowering. He bludgeoned 81 on debut, pouched five catches and a stumping, and barely paused for breath until stepping down in 2008. Only in the closing stages of an untouchable career did his appetite slow - he was troubled by Andrew Flintoff's around-the-wicket angle during 2005 and found the flaw difficult to overcome - and his match-turning 144 against Bangladesh in April 2006 was his first century in 16 Tests. "", ""The 2006-07 Ashes series was literally hit and miss, with three single-figure scores, two fifties and his most brutal hundred. At home his one-day form was subdued, but the game's biggest competition - and it's most important match - brought out Gilchrist's highest standards. He stole the World Cup final from Sri Lanka with 149 off 104 balls, slamming 13 fours and eight sixes, and added to his 54 and 57 from his previous two global triumphs. Using a tip from his batting coach Bob Meuleman, he put a squash ball in his glove to allow him to hit straighter - the advice should have been patented instantly. "", ""In Tests, three Gilchrist innings rank among the most amazing by Australians: his death-defying unbeaten 149 against Pakistan at Hobart when all seemed lost, his savage and emotional 204 not out against South Africa at Johannesburg, and his 57-delivery Ashes century at Perth when he missed equalling Richards' world mark by a ball. In one-dayers, his 172 is the third-highest score by an Australian and his 472 dismissals might take decades to top. "", ""As Australia's 41st Test captain he found the extra burden tiring, and was happy for Ricky Ponting to step in once Steve Waugh retired. But as Ponting's fill-in he crossed the final frontier, leading Australia to their first series win in India for 35 years in 2004-05. As a wicketkeeper he lacked Rod Marsh's acrobatics and Ian Healy's finesse, and he probably peaked at 30 in 2002. But if he clutched few screamers he dropped even fewer sitters, although one easy offering in Adelaide convinced him it was time to go. During that match against India he briefly became the leading gloveman in Test cricket by overtaking Mark Boucher, then the following day announced his retirement from all cricket but the Indian Premier League."", ' \n', ' September 2008']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year - 2002', 'One-Day International Player of the Year - 2003', 'One-Day International Player of the Year - 2004', 'Walter Lawrence Trophy 2010']",96.0,137,20,5570.0,204*,47.6,6796,81.95,17,26,677,100,379,37,287.0,279,11,9619.0,172,35.89,9922,96.94,16,55,1162,149,417.0,55.0,13.0,13,1,272.0,48,22.66,192,141.66,0,0,27,13,17.0,0.0,190.0,280,46,10334,204*,44.16,,,30,43,,,756,55,356.0,343,19,11326,172,34.95,,,18,63,,,526.0,65.0,102.0,102,5,2622,109*,27.03,1869,140.28,3,13,296,120,74.0,22.0,96.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,287.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,13.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,190.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,356.0,,12,10,0,-,-,-,5.00,-,0,0,0,102.0,1,1,0,1,1/0,1/0,0.00,0.00,1.0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

It enabled him to shrug off years of carping that he was technically too limited for Test cricket because of the way he played around his front pad, and it enabled him to touch rarefied heights of batsmanship. Before his maiden first-class innings, he asked if anyone had made 200 on debut, then went out and hit 149. The runs rarely abated over the next 17 years. Tall, powerful and equipped with concentration befitting the fisherman and surfer that he is, he battered the ball at and through the off side for days at a time. He has also made himself a fine catcher in the slips and gully.  \n"", ""Hayden's earliest Tests were exclusively against South Africa and West Indies, a trial for any opener. They were not auspicious, but patience and willpower won the day, especially after the tour of India in 2000-01, where he slog-swept his way to 549 runs, an Australian record for a three-Test series. By the end of 2001 he had broken Bob Simpson's Australian mark for most Test runs in a calendar year - Ricky Ponting first topped Hayden's 1391 in 2003 - and formed a prodigiously prolific opening partnership with Justin Langer. Belatedly he came good in the one-day arena too, and by the time the 2003 World Cup rolled around he was ranked among the top three batsmen in both forms of the game. Later that year he hammered 380 against Zimbabwe at Perth, briefly borrowing the Test record from Brian Lara, and in mid-2004 he was at it again, battering Sri Lanka for twin centuries that took his tally to 20 in only 55 Tests. "", ""Weary through years of plunder and a difficult India tour, Hayden experienced an extended slump during 2004-05 and was initially replaced as one-day opener by Michael Clarke. His lack of form and footwork continued against England and his disastrous series only improved at The Oval with 138. It was the awkward beginning of a resurgence that extended his career and thrust him towards more middle-aged domination. Usually playing more patiently, he followed his south London renaissance with three hundreds in successive matches, becoming the third player next to Bradman and Barrington to score four in a row twice, and passed 1000 runs in a calendar year for the fifth time. After reaching three figures on five occasions during 2005-06 and adding 153 at the MCG a year later, he stood behind only Bradman, Ponting and Waugh on Australia's list of century-makers. With three hundreds in consecutive games against India in 2007-08, he quickly leapfrogged Bradman's 29, and had 30 when he waved goodbye.\n \nRegaining the Ashes in 2006-07 brought tears to Hayden's eyes and he was also saddened when Langer retired at the end of the series, although his mood lifted when he won back his one-day place. In the final match of the 2006-07 Chappell-Hadlee series he thumped an Australian-record 181 off 166 balls, which included ten sixes, and showed his impressive power. More muscle was on display at the World Cup as he averaged 73.22 in scoring 659 runs, the most at the tournament, and he later revealed he was carrying a fractured toe "", ' a broken bone in his other foot. A frightening 66-ball century against South Africa earned him honorary St Kitts citizenship and the outdoors man completed a dream trip by scoring another two hundreds, hooking a 136kg marlin and winning the World Cup for a second time. ', ""A year later he was back in the Caribbean only briefly, returning home without playing a Test due to an Achilles injury suffered during training while on Indian Premier League duty. Australia's top order lost strength without him, just as it had when India ended the 16-match winning streak at the WACA. He had been keen to push on until the 2009 Ashes, but disappointing displays in the lost series against India and South Africa in 2008-09 prompted him to announce his retirement after the Sydney Test.

Hauritz gained an unlikely second chance at international level in 2008-09, but quickly grew into an offspinner who could mix attack and defence successfully. He really showed his value last summer when he took 18 wickets in three Tests against Pakistan batsmen who usually cause severe damage to slow bowlers.  \n"", ""The haul followed 11 breakthroughs against West Indies and 10 in the opening three Tests of the 2009 Ashes series, when he started strongly but was left out for the final two matches.

During the past two years he also became a regular contributor in the one-day team, although he is less fancied as a Twenty20 operator."", ""Hauritz surprised himself with his season in 2008-09 as he leapfrogged a host of fringe spinners to finish the season as the only specialist slow bowler with a Cricket Australia contract. It was a stunning turnaround for an offie who was cut loose following his first Test in 2004. Having watched Beau Casson, Jason Krejza, Cameron White and Bryce McGain take preference following Stuart MacGill's retirement in 2008, Hauritz was picked for the second Test against New Zealand in Adelaide despite not playing for New South Wales the previous week. In three matches at home he took nine wickets and appeared in his first ODI for six years, but was kept in the dressing room for the Tests in South Africa. After four breakthroughs in the opening one-dayer against the Proteas, he was chosen in every 50-over contest over two series, leading Australia's wicket-takers in the United Arab Emirates. "", ""Hauritz, an Australian Under-19 captain, made his ODI debut at 20 and was a surprise selection for the Test tour of India ahead of MacGill in 2004. Hauritz made his debut in the fourth Test, becoming Queensland's first slow-bowling representative since Trevor Hohns in 1989, and picked up Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman after opening the bowling in the second innings. His five match wickets were a distant memory on returning home, where he struggled in first-class games and was dropped towards the end of the 2004-05 season. In the next summer he also received limited opportunities with the Bulls and left for New South Wales. "", ""He played three Pura Cup games - including the final loss to Tasmania - in his first season with the Blues and his four dismissals cost 63.50 each. However, his one-day form was excellent and he missed only one match, leading the state's wicket tally with 14 at 24. He appeared in only one first-class game the following summer, but was a fixture in the FR Cup and his seven wickets at 46.28 - and an economy rate of 4.83 - persuaded the national selectors to include him in the 30-man squad for the postponed version of the 2008 Champions Trophy.

Not surprisingly, he was named the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year.

In 73 one-day internationals, accumulated in ten countries across seven years, he has never hit a half-century nor taken a five-for, nor truly guaranteed himself a regular spot in pyjamas. He clubs a few runs here and nails the odd wicket there while going for around five an over, which is better than it sounds given that he bowls always in the rush hour. In England, however, Harvey's handy yorker, shock bumper, skidding bounce and flotilla of slower variations have earned him nationwide esteem.

Whether an adaptation of his first name or a comparison to the stampeding animal, it fits Ryan Harris perfectly. A hulking fast bowler who charges in and tramples the hopes of opposition batsmen, Harris delivers wickets in bulk. The only problem for Australia is a long and varied list of injuries that have kept Harris from playing anywhere near the amount of Test cricket they would have liked. He was also a late entrant to international cricket, debuting at the age of 29. For the first half of his career, Harris was little more than a journeyman medium-pacer with South Australia. A significant boost in pace came from increased strength and fitness, and by the time he moved to Queensland in 2008 - via a mistaken signing with Sussex on a British passport - he was a genuine fast bowler. His first season with the Bulls brought 33 victims at 26.48 and Australian honours weren't far away. \n"", ""His debut Test series in New Zealand in 2010 brought nine wickets and later that year he claimed nine in the Perth Ashes Test, but in the following match his intensive method of exploding through the crease led to a broken bone in his left ankle that required surgery and ruled him out for half a year. Harris already had a chronic knee injury that will be with him until he retires, but when fit he is invaluable. A hamstring injury ruled him out of the last Test in Sri Lanka in 2011, but already his five-for had helped deliver victory in Galle and his late movement helped make him Australia's leading wicket taker. He flew home from the South African tour later that year with a hip injury that caused him to miss five Tests, and on the West Indies tour in 2012 he was controversially rested for the middle Test of a three-match series. Shoulder surgery in the 2012 winter meant he missed the whole 2012-13 international summer, but a return late in the Sheffield Shield season was encouraging. Despite picking up an Achilles tendon injury in the IPL, he was able to play in the 2013 Ashes in England."", ""Australia's selectors desperately wanted him for that tour, despite the fact that he had not played Tests for nearly 15 months. Despite being left out of the first Test, he was Australia's Player of the Series in the Ashes defeat and his 24 wickets at 19.58 included a career-best 7 for 117 at Chester-le-Street and a five-for at Lord's. One of the few Australians to emerge from that tour with his head held high, Harris was also named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Few people expected him to last the full Ashes series at home, given his history of injuries, but Australia's selectors stuck with him throughout and he repaid them with another outstanding campaign. His 22 wickets at 19.31 put him second only to Mitchell Johnson, and he was Man of the Match at the SCG for his eight-wicket game. He delivered another victory in Cape Town with a bustling and tireless effort late on the final day of the series, with 4 for 32 against South Africa. Knee surgery awaited him immediately when he returned home, but he was able to recover over the winter and play in the home Test series against India.\n""]",['Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy 2002'],27.0,39,11,603.0,74,21.53,955,63.14,0,3,63,9,13,0,21.0,13,7,48.0,21,8.0,48,100.00,0,0,3,1,6.0,0.0,3.0,1,1,2.0,2*,-,1,200.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,82.0,122,20,2056,94,20.15,3231,63.63,0,11,,,41,0,85.0,51,19,411,39,12.84,570,72.10,0,0,,,33.0,0.0,64.0,37,15,239,31,10.86,231,103.46,0,0,12,6,23.0,0.0,27.0,52,5736,2658,113.0,7/117,9/106,23.52,2.78,50.7,4,5,0,21.0,20,1031,832,44.0,5/19,5/19,18.9,4.84,23.4,0,3,0,3.0,3,70,95,4.0,2/27,2/27,23.75,8.14,17.5,0,0,0,82.0,,16387,8045,303,7/60,,26.55,2.94,54.0,15,10,0,85.0,,4135,3394,123,5/19,5/19,27.59,4.92,33.6,3,4,0,64.0,63,1413,1745,81,4/34,4/34,21.54,7.40,17.4,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

His immediate predecessor was Adam Gilchrist, whose presence prevented Haddin from making his Test debut until the age of 30. However, Haddin made up for lost time by eventually becoming vice-captain to Michael Clarke and a key senior figure in a developing side. Never was he more important than in during the 2013-14 Ashes clean-sweep, when he bailed Australia out of tricky positions in every first innings of the campaign. His 493 runs at 61.62 put him second only to David Warner on the run tally and he was nimble behind the stumps, and it was only Mitchell Johnson's reign of terror that prevented Haddin being Player of the Series. \n"", ""By 2014, he was again Australia's preferred keeper in all three formats after two years earlier being usurped by Matthew Wade in all three. Haddin had originally lost his Test spot to Wade after flying home from the 2012 West Indies tour when his 17-month-old daughter Mia was diagnosed with cancer. At 34, it seemed as though his international career might be over, but Haddin showed his dedication by returning to domestic cricket and winning back his place for the 2013 Ashes tour, when Australia's selectors wanted his experience and poise. Renowned as a loyal team man who could be brusque with the media, Haddin was a valuable lieutenant and sounding board for Clarke during the back-to-back Ashes series."", ""Haddin's first taste of Test cricket had come in the West Indies in 2008, when he played through the pain of a broken finger. Flaws in his keeping were on show in India in 2008 but his glovework gradually improved, and a batting breakthrough in 2008-09 gave him confidence. In his 16th Test innings he passed 50 for the first time and went on to 169 against New Zealand in Adelaide, showing flashes Gilchrist would have accepted. An important one-day batsman who shuffled around the order, Haddin also had the chance to captain Australia in T20s in 2009 when Ricky Ponting, Clarke and Michael Hussey were rested. He was also starting to prove himself a productive Test run-maker, which continued on the 2009 Ashes tour with 121 in Cardiff and 80 at Lord's, where he also gave up 20 byes as he struggled to deal with the late movement. A broken finger gave Graham Manou an opening at Edgbaston, but Haddin returned for the final two Tests. "", ""He remained a useful batting contributor in 2009-10 but his highlight was the spectacular, one-handed take at full stretch down the legside off Salman Butt. It was a hugely impressive catch that helped Australia to an unbelievable win at the SCG in 2009-10. (New Zealand supporters find it hard to forget the glove-assisted bowled of Neil Broom in a one-day game the previous summer.) Another injury, a batting-related elbow problem, rubbed him out of the Pakistan series in England, where Tim Paine was used, and after 136 in the opening Ashes Test of 2010-11, Haddin endured a more difficult period in 2011. Notably, he was one of the major culprits in Australia's 47 all out in Cape Town, when at 18 for 5 he backed away and tried to drive Vernon Philander on the up through the off side, gifting South Africa a sixth wicket. A lean home series against India followed, before Wade took his place in the West Indies."", 'A valuable presence in the limited-overs sides, Haddin has scored ODI centuries opening the batting. He is a clean, effortless hitter and his lofted straight drive is among the best shots in the game. He made his ODI debut in 2001 but had to see off the likes of Darren Berry, Wade Seccombe and Ryan Campbell to become keeper-in-waiting behind Gilchrist. A former Australia Under-19 captain who grew up in Gundagai, Haddin began his domestic career in 1997-98 with the ACT Comets in their debut Mercantile Mutual Cup season. Two years later he was playing for New South Wales, and played in their successful Pura Cup/Sheffield Shield finals of 2002-03 and 2007-08, and captained them to the title in 2004-05.\n']",[],66.0,112,13,3266.0,169,32.98,5587,58.45,4,18,363,54,262,8,126.0,115,16,3122.0,110,31.53,3706,84.24,2,16,296,71,170.0,11.0,34.0,29,6,402.0,47,17.47,351,114.52,0,0,30,13,17.0,6.0,184.0,300,39,9932,169,38.05,,,17,56,,,608,40,235.0,221,24,6503,138*,33.01,,,9,35,,,318.0,50.0,97.0,91,13,1747,76,22.39,1384,126.22,0,10,144,67,61.0,20.0,66.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,126.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,34.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,184.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,235.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,97.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

That summit came during 2013-14, when in successive series he cowed the batsmen of England and South Africa with his speed and aggression. In those eight Tests he collected 59 wickets at 15.23, along with a big bunch of cherries on helmets and gloves. Not surprisingly it led to Johnson winning his first Allan Border Medal, and at the age of 32 he was finally achieving the sorts of feats that Dennis Lillee might have expected when he first spotted Johnson's talent as a 17-year-old. There had been other highlights along the way for Johnson, including brutal spells against South Africa in 2008-09, but the lows of his 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes campaigns left his legacy looking uncertain. Nerves and family problems contributed to those struggles, but a broken toe in 2011 gave him time away from the game and the chance to reflect on where he was going. \n"", ""It was still far from smooth sailing: he offered little on the 2013 tour of India and was not even picked for the 2013 Ashes in England, but his return for the home Ashes that followed was emphatic. Wearing a moustache reminiscent of Lillee, he delivered a series of fast-bowling spells that would not have been out of place in the Lillee-Thomson era. Johnson intimidated with his bouncer and made England's batsmen seriously uncomfortable; that he was Player of the Series was no surprise. As described by "", ', the mood changed whenever he tore in: ""This was something visceral: a hush followed by a crescendo"". A 12-wicket Test in Centurion in Australia\'s next series showed that it was no fluke. After that South African tour Johnson\'s pace eased off again, but he remained a strike weapon and became the fifth Australian bowler to take 300 wickets in Tests.  ', ""An athlete who started out preferring tennis, Johnson was late to focus on cricket and suffered early in his career with four back stress fractures that almost floored him for good. He persevered, driving a plumbing van when he lost his Queensland contract, and made his Test debut in 2007 after the retirement of Glenn McGrath. With a strong, flowing run to the crease, Johnson can become mechanical in delivery, especially if his wrist, a long-term concern, is in the wrong position. When it's bad, he sprays the ball on both sides of the wicket like an old-fashioned firebrand. When it's perfect, there are few better bowlers in the game.

While his greatest success came as a Test player, he also appeared in 47 ODIs and was a member of Australia's triumphant 1987 World Cup side. His most famous contribution was in 1992-93, in the fourth Test against the West Indies. Recalled to the team and playing on his home ground in Adelaide, he brought Australia back into contention with career-best figures of 5 for 9 off 6.5 overs, and then shared in a 40-run last-wicket stand with Craig McDermott - only to witness his partner's dismissal from the non-striker's end. May finished unbeaten on 42, his highest Test score, and West Indies claimed the Test - and went on to win the series - by a margin of just one run. The match also marked the first time May was partnered with Shane Warne. The combination was particularly effective on the 1993 Ashes tour when May finished with 21 wickets and Warne picked up 34. In subsequent series wickets became scarcer for May, but he was able to dry up runs and his long spells also reduced Warne's workload.  \n"", ""May retained an active role after retiring by becoming the inaugural CEO of the Australian Cricketers' Association in 1997, and latterly the chief executive of the Federation of International Players' Associations.

For the brash 21-year-old who waltzed into the Australian team at Dean Jones's expense, batting was an exercise in extravagance. To defend was to display weakness - a policy that backfired in 1993-94 when Martyn's airy square-drive at a crucial moment in Sydney triggered a five-run defeat by South Africa and a six-year hitch to his own promising career. By the time Western Australia, wanting a pretty face to spearhead their marketing campaign, had made him captain at 23, Martyn looked a tormented man. All the more remarkable, then, that he blossomed into a relaxed, classical, feathery artist. He was an elastic fieldsman and an old-style batsman whose first movement was back. He played with a high elbow, a still head, a golfer's deft touch, and had all the shots, including perhaps the most brutal reverse-sweep in the game.  \n"", 'Mostly, though, Martyn stuck to the textbook and composed pristine hundreds which, like the feats of the best wicketkeepers, passed almost unnoticed: an observation supported by the curious fact that, despite a Test average in the fifties, he reached the age of 30 without winning a Man-of-the-Match award. He was the quiet man of the 2003 World Cup-raising side, too, playing a minor role until he spanked 88 not out in the final - with a broken finger that later kept him out of a West Indian tour. His magnificent 13-month streak of 1608 Test runs at 61 and two Man-of-the-Series prizes from March 2004 finally moved him from the dressing-room shadows to the more uncomfortable limelight. Showing his hard-earned versatility, he crafted seven centuries on surfaces ranging from raging turners in Sri Lanka and India to green seamers in New Zealand and the hard bounce of home. ', 'The flood ended in England and following a series of 178 runs and a couple of horrid umpiring decisions he was the major casualty of the Ashes loss. Retaining a one-day spot, he expected his five-day days were over - ""If that\'s my last Test match, well, I\'ve had a great time"" - but was reprieved when the selectors wanted experience for the South Africa tour. As the decision to ignore policy by looking back to a 34 year old became increasingly doubtful, Martyn repaid with a nerveless 101 that led to victory in the final Test. After being a key part in Australia\'s first Champions Trophy success, he struggled in the opening two Tests of the Ashes series and swiftly retired. ', ""In February 2008 he swung another surprise of sorts by announcing he had joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League and when that became defunct, comeback-kid Martyn had another unexpected return, signing for Shane Warne's IPL side Rajasthan Royals for US$100,000 in January 2010.

The international grounding and a backyard net helped develop Marsh into one of the finest young run-makers in the country. It also gave him a taste of what he could expect when he joined the national team. He made a successful start to his ODI career in 2008 and then scored a superb century on Test debut in Sri Lanka in 2011. Marsh looked set for a lengthy tenure as Australia's No.3 but a back injury suffered during Australia's disastrous Cape Town Test later that year proved a serious setback. Marsh rejoined the side for the home Tests against India but was a shadow of himself, and 17 runs from six innings was a calamitous return. He was recalled for the 2014 tour of South Africa and scored 148 in Centurion, but was dropped again after making a pair in the next Test.  Another recall came at home against India when Michael Clarke was injured, and 99 at the MCG suggested he still had something to offer.  \n"", 'But in his only Test on the 2015 Ashes tour he scored 0 and 2, and it seemed that might have been his last chance.

Permanency has never arrived, however, through a mixture of form and injury. It felt as though the 2017-18 Ashes promised something better with two hundreds in the series, including one against the pink ball in Adelaide, but there was a subsequent slump in form that again brought the spotlight on his position.', 'Marsh has appealed to a series of Australian selection panels, who have viewed him as a viable top-order prospect in Tests and ODIs especially. His first-class record may be underwhelming for a man given so many chances and his penchant for nicking off early has proved a frustration, but he has also shown himself to be capable of scoring hundreds at the highest level. More gifted than his father - ""He\'s got a few more shots than me,"" Geoff once said - Marsh is a left-hander who impressed the tough judges of Steve and Mark Waugh while scoring his maiden first-class century in 2003. The milestone arrived with two sixes in a row over midwicket off Mark Waugh\'s offspin and a rash of compliments. ""It\'s a pretty good feeling when the Australia captain comes up to you and says \'well done, mate\',"" Marsh said.

In the limited-overs formats, his clean striking makes him an attractive option and he made his maiden ODI hundred against India in Sydney in 2016. A member of the 2015 World Cup-winning squad, Marsh had been earmarked for high honours ever since he captained the Australia Under-19s to victory in the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He made his T20 international debut at 19, having enjoyed his first taste of state cricket at just 17. Marsh honed his skills in the Australian dressing room as a child, when his father Geoff was the national coach. Marsh was also a promising junior Australian rules footballer and hails from a prolific sporting family - his brother Shaun is also an international batsman and his sister Melissa is a basketballer for Perth Lynx in the WNBL."", ' \n']",[],31.0,53,5,1219.0,181,25.39,2375,51.32,2,3,154,17,15.0,0.0,53.0,49,9,1428.0,102*,35.7,1534,93.08,1,11,120,37,25.0,0.0,11.0,11,3,175.0,36,21.87,151,115.89,0,0,7,9,4.0,0.0,97.0,167,13,4885,211,31.72,8827,55.34,11,19,686,63,50.0,0.0,102.0,95,18,2875,124,37.33,3115,92.29,3,20,244,71,52.0,0.0,74.0,67,18,1487,77*,30.34,1233,120.60,0,7,90,66,33.0,0.0,31.0,52,2677,1537,35.0,4/61,5/86,43.91,3.44,76.4,1,0,0,53.0,50,1700,1564,44.0,5/33,5/33,35.54,5.52,38.6,1,1,0,11.0,9,114,156,6.0,2/6,2/6,26.00,8.21,19.0,0,0,0,97.0,130,8013,4577,144,6/84,9/156,31.78,3.42,55.6,7,1,0,102.0,78,2804,2525,84,5/33,5/33,30.05,5.40,33.3,3,2,0,74.0,57,839,1182,43,4/6,4/6,27.48,8.45,19.5,2,0,0,False,False,False,False

But after an inauspicious debut batting at No.3 against India in Adelaide, he was switched to opener where he began to solidify his spot, as well as the fragile top order, forming famous partnerships with two future Australian greats - firstly David Boon and then Mark Taylor.  His steely, often grim, resolve in Tests was a contrast to his one-day batting, and it was in that he really flourished and found his true niche. His 117 one-day internationals yielded 4357 runs at an imposing average just shy of 40, which was almost seven runs higher than his Test average. His nine centuries and 22 half-centuries provided the platform for many Australian victories, with the highlight being the 1987 World Cup final triumph over England in India.   \n', ""When he stepped into the coaching shoes left by long-time mentor Bob Simpson in July 1996, Marsh took control of an Australian side that was the best Test-playing nation in the world, but whose one-day team had been unable to build on the success of 1987.  But Marsh seemingly made a seamless transition, and managed to not only continue Australia's awesome form in the Test arena but, after a few hiccups along the way, transform the one-day team into world champs yet again. He enjoyed Test series victories in the West Indies, Ashes triumphs and a historic win in Pakistan, with a 2-1 defeat in India in 1998 the only blemish. But like his own playing career, it will perhaps again be his one-day achievements that are most fondly remembered.  After a faltering start to their 1999 World Cup campaign, Marsh orchestrated a stunning turnaround by the pre-tournament favourites, with the rampant Australians winning seven pulsating matches in a row, culminating in a crushing victory over a hapless Pakistan in the final, to lift the World Cup trophy for the second time.  "", ""After quitting the Australian job, Marsh was briefly an Australian selector before, in 2001, he took on an altogether different challenge - coaching Zimbabwe. But his tenure coincided with the politicalisation of the national side, and the defection of many key players, and his position became more marginalised and hopeless. He was later also a national selector for Australia, and in September 2011 took over as Sri Lanka's coach.\n""]",[],50.0,93,7,2854.0,138,33.18,8124,35.13,4,15,307,1,38.0,0.0,117.0,115,6,4357.0,126*,39.97,7790,55.93,9,22,302,22,31.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,184.0,323,25,11760,355*,39.46,,,33,46,,,133.0,0.0,169.0,164,13,6366,126*,42.15,,,14,36,,,54.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,35.33,-,-,-,-,-,117.0,1,6,4,0.0,-,-,32.91,4.00,-,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,184.0,,30,9,1,1/1,,9.00,1.80,30.0,,0,0,169.0,,6,4,0,-,-,-,4.00,-,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

The previous year, he had taken up a job on the Adelaide Oval groundstaff, and his bowling talent was spotted by the Redbacks' Big Bash coach Darren Berry. Lyon impressed in Twenty20s for South Australia, made his first-class debut, and within seven months was a Test cricketer. A classical offspinner who flights the ball and looks for wickets, Lyon struck with his first ball in Test cricket when he had Kumar Sangakkara caught at slip in Galle. It was part of a haul of 5 for 34 and the beginning of a career that would, for the most part, end Australia's cycle of churning through Test spinners in the post-Warne era. By 2015, Lyon had become Australia's most successful Test offspinner of all time, passing Hugh Trumble's tally of 141 wickets, and following the post-Ashes retirements of Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin and Shane Watson, he became one of the team's most experienced players. \n"", ""However, Lyon's career was not without bumps along the way. In 2013 he was dropped from the Test team twice, first in India after he was attacked by MS Dhoni in the first Test in Chennai, and then for the first two Tests of the Ashes tour of England. The Ashes axing was especially galling for Lyon, given that he had taken nine wickets in his previous Test, the fourth and final Test of the Indian tour in Delhi, and he was overlooked for the uncapped teenager Ashton Agar. By the third Test of the Ashes, Lyon was rightfully back in the side and continued to be a consistent performer. One gap in his game had been the ability to bowl Australia to victory in the fourth innings of a Test, but he finally achieved that against India in Adelaide in 2014-15, in what became his first Man-of-the-Match performance. Lyon has also played a handful of one-day internationals but, despite first making his name for South Australia in T20, he has generally been considered by the national selectors a Test-only prospect.\n"", '\n']",[],86.0,111,34,923.0,47,11.98,2007,45.98,0,0,116,5,41.0,0.0,21.0,11,8,69.0,30,23.0,73,94.52,0,0,7,2,4.0,0.0,2.0,1,1,4.0,4*,-,4,100.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,145.0,185,53,1682,75,12.74,3431,49.02,0,2,196,15,63.0,0.0,63.0,31,17,205,37*,14.64,199,103.01,0,0,18,8,27.0,0.0,40.0,15,6,51,11,5.66,54,94.44,0,0,4,0,12.0,0.0,86.0,164,21905,11059,343.0,8/50,13/154,32.24,3.02,63.8,13,14,2,21.0,21,1182,942,22.0,4/44,4/44,42.81,4.78,53.7,1,0,0,2.0,2,30,48,1.0,1/33,1/33,48.00,9.6,30.0,0,0,0,145.0,266,34445,17632,510,8/50,13/154,34.57,3.07,67.5,20,16,2,63.0,62,3421,2739,76,4/10,4/10,36.03,4.80,45.0,4,0,0,40.0,39,820,981,49,5/23,5/23,20.02,7.17,16.7,1,1,0,False,False,False,False

But two prolific seasons for Queensland, punctuated by a successful sojourn in south Wales for Glamorgan, propelled Maher back into the one-day reckoning. He announced his return with 95 in the second match against South Africa at Centurion in 2002, and followed that up with a vital 43 not out to secure a tie at Potchefstroom.  \n', ""A country boy from the far north of Queensland - he was born in Innisfail, just south of Cairns - Maher's bubbly personality made him a popular member of dressing rooms from the Gabba to the Gower. He took a while to get the hang of English pitches, but innate footwork and savvy shot-selection won through in the end. He continued that form back in Australia, slamming 174 against Victoria and 209 against South Australia on his way to becoming the first batsman to reach 1000 Pura Cup runs in 2001-02. A series of handy one-day performances won him a place as the spare batsman (and the stand-in wicketkeeper) in the 2003 World Cup-winning squad, although he appeared in only two matches. Tours to West Indies and India followed but his 26-match one-day journey ended when Brad Haddin assumed the back-up gloveman's role. "", ""Replacing Stuart Law as Queensland's captain, Maher lost five domestic finals in a row before sealing his first win as leader with the 2005-06 Pura Cup. He marked the occasion with a career-high 223 and then let his batsmen race to an unstoppable 6 declared for 900, dedicating the victory to victims of a fierce cyclone in north Queensland the previous week. Maher's Man-of-the-Match performance guided him to a personal haul of 906 runs at 53.29 in the competition and showed that at 32 he had energy left. "", ""The run-scoring leader in the interstate one-day tournament, Maher's stand-out limited-overs moment came with a national-record 187 from 129 deliveries against Western Australia in 2003-04 as the Bulls charged to an unmatched 405 in 50 overs. He also values highly his 108 in the limited-overs final of 2006-07, which set up Queensland's FR Cup victory at the MCG.

During this time, Lillee continued to work on his fitness, and honed the efficiency of his approach and delivery action."", ""Further fine performances after his return to Test cricket and through to the early 1980s reflected Lillee's increased ability to outwit batsmen. He had lost some of the pace of his youth but continued to exploit batsmen's weaknesses utilising clever variations in length, pace and movement."", ""His best Test figures were achieved in a remarkable match against the West Indies in 1981.

An accomplished leader of New South Wales, he has plenty to offer tactically, although he is expected to be too old to be a serious contender as the next Test captain.

Like India. A swing bowler who learned to weave outswingers on Gabba greentops, Kasprowicz matured into a subcontinental specialist with reverse-swing, heavy cut and a this-isn't-too-hot-for-another-over attitude. He bravely carried an injury-hit attack struck by Navjot Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar in 1997-98, popped back in 2001 and returned in 2004 to help end India's 35-year hold. And when his first-class career finished in 2007-08 he joined the Indian Cricket League. \n"", ""After three years mostly spent refining his efficient yet aggressive action with Queensland and Glamorgan, Kasprowicz celebrated his fifth recall in 2004 with 13 matches, his longest Test run. During the wildly successful year the prongs of McGrath, Gillespie and Kasprowicz were so sharp that Brett Lee ran their refreshments. To call Kasprowicz a workhorse is unflattering even though the description matches his stamina and size - he was an Australian Schoolboys rugby forward. Regularly clocked faster than his new-ball counterparts (excluding Lee) from a shorter run, Kasprowicz's angle and dart-perfect line caused constant headaches for international left-handers in the style of Paul Reiffel, another under-rated third wheel. He became an important clean-up or go-to man and only four times in 2004 did he leave an innings without a wicket as he collected 47 victims. "", ""An intimidating and muscular presence at county and state level - he often broke bones in England and peer pressure from Pura Cup batsmen hurried his Test and one-day returns - Kasprowicz became Queensland's leading wicket-taker in 2003-04, but after missing most of 2006-07 he had a battle to stay ahead of his best man Andy Bichel. Back and groin problems, which started in South Africa and were irritated by the pre-Ashes boot camp, limited him to a season of eight deliveries for Queensland and he lost his Cricket Australia deal. The problems also contributed to an abbreviated final campaign of 15 breakthroughs, which was enough for him to retire as the state's highest wicket-taker with 501 first-class dismissals - at the time it was 38 more than Bichel."", ""Popular and cheerful off the field, `Kasper' experienced the lows of being 12th man for Queensland's first Sheffield Shield win in 1994-95, waiting five months and three Tests for his first wicket and completing a regular do-si-do for a national place with Bichel. However, his greatest miss came during the 2005 Ashes series when his courageous 59-run partnership with Lee at Edgbaston ended three short of victory. After adding 20 he gloved a contentious catch behind and England levelled the series 1-1. Returning from that tour on the outer, he responded with 44 Pura Cup wickets for the Bulls and was recalled for the trip to South Africa, where he and Lee reversed their Birmingham nightmare with a 19-run stand that earned a nail-biting two-wicket victory.

As a stocky, free-scoring left-hander, Lehmann was able to treat spectators to an audacious mixture of aggression and deft finesse. Having arrived on the state cricket scene as a 17-year-old, Lehmann had played more first-class games and scored more runs than any other Australian before making his Test debut in Bangalore in 1998, although his record was later beaten by Michael Hussey. He initially struggled to hold down his Test spot but eventually bucked the trend of youth by establishing himself in the Australia side at 33 with a maiden hundred at Port-of-Spain in his tenth Test, and then two against both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the next 12 months. Named stand-in vice-captain for the 2004 India tour when Ricky Ponting broke his thumb, Lehmann offered to give up his place to Michael Clarke after his amazing debut century at Bangalore, and limped out of the series after the third Test with a torn hamstring. He returned for the home summer but was dropped for good after struggling against Pakistan. \n', ""Lehmann's talents won him far more regular opportunities in Australia's one-day international team and in 1999 he had the honour of hitting the winning runs in the World Cup final at Lord's. He was also a key member of the side that defended the title four years later, although his entry into the tournament was delayed by a suspension for a racist dressing-room outburst. An integral member of winning Sheffield Shield sides in 1990-91 and 1995-96 and Yorkshire's victorious County Championship team of 2001, Lehmann finished his first-class career as the highest run scorer in Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup history, with 13,635 runs at 54.97. He entered coaching via the IPL, where he was at the helm of the Deccan Chargers when they won the tournament in 2009. Lehmann was named coach of Queensland in early 2011 and quickly won the respect of the players for his straightforward approach. Under Lehmann, the Bulls won the 2011-12 Sheffield Shield and the 2012-13 Ryobi Cup. His success and popularity with his players made him an attractive candidate for higher coaching honours and Cricket Australia sprung a surprise by sacking Mickey Arthur and naming Lehmann coach of the national side less than three weeks before the start of the 2013 Ashes.\n "", '\n']","['Walter Lawrence Trophy 2000', 'State Player of the Year - 2000', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2001', 'State Player of the Year - 2001', 'State Player of the Year - 2002', 'Wisden Australia Cricketer of the Year 2004-05']",27.0,42,2,1798.0,177,44.95,2909,61.80,5,10,214,10,11.0,0.0,117.0,101,22,3078.0,119,38.96,3784,81.34,4,17,227,14,26.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,284.0,479,33,25795,339,57.83,,,82,111,,,143.0,0.0,367.0,341,61,13122,191,46.86,,,19,94,,,109.0,0.0,17.0,17,4,381,48,29.30,323,117.95,0,0,43,2,4.0,0.0,27.0,25,974,412,15.0,3/42,6/92,27.46,2.53,64.9,0,0,0,117.0,62,1793,1445,52.0,4/7,4/7,27.78,4.83,34.4,1,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,284.0,,9458,4540,130,4/35,,34.92,2.88,72.7,,0,0,367.0,,6371,4767,172,4/7,4/7,27.71,4.48,37.0,2,0,0,17.0,13,228,256,11,3/19,3/19,23.27,6.73,20.7,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

From his\nbase in Wollongong, Lee showed great potential as a junior: this promise\nculminating in selection in Australia's Under-19 team in 1991-92. In subsequent years he duly became a particularly skilled performer at interstate level, where his prowess as a clean striker of the ball was in regular evidence. He also enjoyed a productive season of county cricket with Somerset in 1996, topping his team's batting averages, even if his bowling was not altogether suited by the slower and lower conditions.  Along similar lines, Lee made a huge impact in his first match in the international arena, raising visions of great things as he struck a whirlwind 39 against West Indies at Adelaide in December 1995. After failing to recapture this form later in the series and again in the 1996 World Cup, though, he was left out of the national side for a period of over two years. Lee renewed his claims to a more permanent position in the Australian side with an excellent 1999-2000 one-day international campaign on home soil, where the focus increasingly turned to his accurate, intelligent bowling.

Fast and with a flashy smile that added to his star quality, he finished as Australia's fourth-most successful bowler with 310 wickets in 76 matches. A refusal to bow to severe injuries increases his rating, but for most of his career he operated as brutal support for Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie. In his final two years he was a highly dependable attack leader until his body limited his ability to back up in five-day contests. \n"", 'At his best he gained outswing with the new ball and reverse with the older one, making him even more difficult for batsmen trying to steady themselves while knowing he could reach 160kph. The charging run-up and leaping celebrations added to the theatre for a bowler who made an instant impact when taking five wickets on debut at the MCG. Forty-two victims came in his opening seven Tests to gain him an A-list reputation, but he was soon in rehabilitation after an elbow operation. His ankles were a popular site for surgery and there were also side strains and stress fractures in a familiar cycle of breath-taking pace, painful injury and long-term layoff.', ""After starting by shaking up batsmen with short balls and yorkers, Lee became a smarter operator under Ricky Ponting's captaincy and knew when to deliver a burst of speed or a containing spell. In nine Tests following McGrath's departure, Lee stood up with 58 victims at 21.55 and also won the Allan Border Medal in 2008. During that period he helped keep the rebuilding side on top of the world. "", ""Life soon became harder again and after returning from more ankle surgery - his last act in a Test was limping off the MCG with a broken foot - he missed the 2009 Ashes with a side strain. England wasn't a kind host for Lee, who was consoled by Andrew Flintoff during his absorbing yet heart-breaking batting near-miss in Edgbaston in 2005. He was a courageous run-maker who would deflect or absorb the efforts of opposing fast men as they searched for payback."", 'A gentleman off the field, he was aggressive on it and rarely went over the top in comparison to his team-mates, although his bouncers at the tail-enders were uncomfortable viewing.

Much later, Mike Atherton compared McGrath to Ambrose on a vaster scale. Catapulted from the outback of New South Wales into Test cricket to replace Merv Hughes in 1993, McGrath became the greatest Australian fast bowler of his time. He went on to beat Courtney Walsh\'s 519 wickets in the 2005 Super Test to become the leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers and his claim to the title of Australia\'s greatest fast man is contested only by Dennis Lillee. His obituary was prepared a few times - he was doubted after coming back in 2004 from ankle surgery and there were similar fears following a long lay-off to care for his wife two years later - but he wrote his own farewells. He retired from Tests at the SCG - his home ground - after Australia whitewashed England 5-0 in the 2006-07 Ashes and was adjudged the Man of the Tournament during Australia\'s successful World Cup campaign in 2007, his final one-day appearance. \n', ""McGrath's USP was an unremitting off-stump line and an immaculate length. He gained off-cut and bounce, specialised in the opposition's biggest wickets - especially Atherton's and Brian Lara's - and he was unafraid to back himself publicly in these key duels. He was a batting rabbit who applied himself so intently that while playing for Worcestershire he won a bet with an Australian team-mate by scoring a fifty. The hard work eventually paid off in Tests, when he made 61, then the third-highest score by a No. 11, against New Zealand in 2004-05. Only in his occasional fits of ill-temper did he fail himself. "", ""He rewrote the World Cup record-books in 2003 with 7 for 15 against the outclassed Namibians, on his way to adding another winner's medal to a bulging collection. An ankle injury threatened to derail his quest for 500 Test wickets, but after briefly contemplating retirement he bounced back with yet another five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka at Darwin in July 2004. Three months later, at Nagpur, he became the first fast bowler to play 100 matches in the baggy green, and his greatness was further confirmed when knocking down the brittle Pakistanis at Perth with 8 for 24, the second-best figures by an Australian. "", ""Adept at picking his moments, he chose the first day at Lord's to reach 500 and his subsequent ankle and arm injuries were crucial to Australia losing the Ashes in 2005. The following summer was also painfully disrupted with the recurrence of his wife Jane's cancer, which called for immediate treatment and McGrath's full attention. He pulled out of the VB Series finals as well as tours to South Africa and Bangladesh, but he made an emphatic comeback that culminated in him taking a record 26 wickets in the 2007 World Cup.

McDermott was not as fiery as his red hair suggested, nor did he capture the public imagination in the manner of Dennis Lillee or Shane Warne, but he was a textbook outswing bowler with a classic side-on action who could run through any batting order on his day. He was also a thumping batsman in his youth. Like all self-respecting Aussies, he saved his best for England, with 84 wickets in 17 Tests, including two eight-fors and eight of his 14 five-fors. His best performance was probably at Perth in 1990-91, when he took 8 for 97 as England collapsed from 191 for 2 to 244 all out.

It takes an extremely critical eye to diminish his run-scoring achievements, which seem to collect new records in every series. Like spotting a celebrity, it's necessary to look twice when analysing Ponting, first as the archetypal modern batsman, then as the country's 42nd Test captain. There is no doubt about his greatness after taking guard, but his leadership has been under scrutiny for much of his reign. While his blade has sparkled, his stewardship is pock-marked by three  Ashes defeats - two in England and one at home - and stumbles to South Africa and India.  \n"", ""Those results didn't stop him from becoming the most successful captain in Test history after passing Steve Waugh's 41 wins in the 2009-10 Boxing Day Test. In the same match he overtook Shane Warne's 92 victories as the most by an individual, and he led Australia to 26 consecutive undefeated (completed) World Cup games. He stepped down from the captaincy when that run ended, in the 2011 World Cup. For the first three years of his reign he was in charge of a superstar unit and did not have to decide much tactically, but once that group headed for retirement he had to change from a manager to moulder. "", ""As a batsman the only debate is where to rank him in the high reaches of the game's greatest run-makers. Acclaimed by Academy coach Rod Marsh as the best teenage batsman he had ever seen, Ponting began with Tasmania at 17 and Australia at 20, and was given out unluckily for 96 on his Test debut. There were some teething problems, including a public admission of an alcohol problem, but the longer he went on the more he matured, building up records and runs. "", ""He plays all the shots with a full flourish of the bat - the cover drive and the pull are particularly productive methods - and knows only to attack. His breathtaking, dead-eye fielding is a force in the game by itself. Only Sachin Tendulkar has more centuries in Tests and ODIs combined than Ponting, who is a natural in the game's traditional forms, but resistant to the perks of Twenty20, from which he retired from in 2009. There have been setbacks against probing seam attacks, high-class finger-spin and, latterly, short balls, which he insists are meant to be pulled or hooked.

He had also played in two successful domestic one-day finals for the Tigers, and was Man of the Match in the 2009-10 final when he opened the batting and scored 100. A respected leader who often captained Tasmania, Paine also led the Hobart Hurricanes, and it was ultimately through T20 that his return to international cricket finally arrived."", 'The composure Paine showed in the shortest form, combined with the underwhelming contributions of Peter Nevill and Matthew Wade, led selectors to think laterally ahead of the 2017-18 Ashes, in which his selection was the most surprising and indeed contentious. But he performed admirably as part of a winning team, and then found himself thrust into the centre of things on the subsequent South Africa tour. He was initially the man who separated David Warner from Quinton de Kock in the Durban stairwell, then the man who replaced Steven Smith as captain the morning after the Newlands ball-tampering fiasco.

He saved his loudest grunt for his batting, where he was that rarest of modern-day creatures - an unabashed six-hitter in the mould of a George Bonnor or a Colin Milburn or a David Hookes. Batting for Gloucestershire at 20, he scythed 16 sixes in the first dig [a world record] against Glamorgan at Abergavenny, 20 for the match [another first], and then announced he couldn't care less about the milestone; he wanted only to help his team. His flaw was to attempt one six too many - invariably off the wrong ball - and get mixed up in off-field troubles.  \n"", '""I used to hate watching him bat,"" his old coach Toot Byron once lamented. ""He wasn\'t in control of his shot-selection ... he\'d get 24 off an over and then go out on the last ball of that over."" Legend has it that Symonds, a Queensland larrikin who shaved his dreadlocks early in 2009, once turned up barefoot and wearing a cowboy hat for a contract meeting with Cricket Australia\'s then-chief executive Malcolm Speed. He also ruled himself ineligible for any award at the 2006 Allan Border Medal - he would have been the One-Day Player of the Year - after being suspended for turning up drunk before Australia\'s embarrassing loss to Bangladesh on the 2005 Ashes tour. ', 'During almost five years in and out of the one-day side he frittered away golden opportunities galore. One day changed everything. Striding out with his team in turmoil against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup, a game and tournament he never expected to play in, Symonds sculpted a masterly 143 not out in 125 balls. Until that day, he had mustered just 762 one-day runs at only 23; after that he averaged more than 43 and became a hero to those who adored his clumping style. ""In the past,"" he admitted, ""I was a man without a map when I went out to bat."" He grew to understand his one-day role perfectly - he could have claimed to be the side\'s most valuable player after pounding three hundreds and taking 21 wickets in 2005-06. His impact to the limited-overs outfit was shown the following season after he ripped a tendon from his arm playing a fierce drive. Without him the team struggled to its worst losing streak in a decade. Symonds proved he was an incredibly quick healer by entering the World Cup mid-tournament and was part of his second consecutive triumph. ', ""Born in Birmingham, Symonds could have played for England but dreamed only of wearing the baggy green. In 2004 his fantasy was fulfilled in decidedly unGabbalike surroundings: the crackling minefields of Sri Lanka. He batted gamely without looking altogether comfortable, and was dumped after two Tests. Almost two years later he received an extended run as Australia's selectors searched for an answer to Andrew Flintoff, but he couldn't consistently mirror his one-day performances. Faced with the axe, he cracked a huge six at the MCG to open his scoring in a pressure-relieving 72 from 54 balls, which included a ground-record five maximums, but was dropped on the Bangladesh tour after struggling for reliable impact in the previous series against South Africa. Given another opportunity when Shane Watson was injured and Damien Martyn retired, he appeared in his first Ashes series and reached a career high in his second game with 156 at the MCG. Batting with his fishing friend Matthew Hayden, he showed he had the mindset to make it. "", 'The 2007-08 campaign was easily his best, with 777 runs in nine Tests against Sri Lanka, India and West Indies. The high was an unbeaten 162 in the first innings at the SCG, which was quickly followed by the low of a lengthy race row involving Harbhajan Singh. The problems did not prevent him becoming the most popular overseas player at the Indian Premier League auction, where he sold for US$1.35m, and he had four games with the Deccan Chargers. After the tournament he switched back into five-day mode and a pair of half-centuries in the tight opening contest with West Indies showed his growing batting maturity and sense of security at Test level. By the end of the campaign his average was a respectable 44.65. ', 'However, his off-field attitude continued to be a problem and the last straw came when he went fishing in Darwin when he should have been at a team meeting in the lead-up to an ODI series against Bangladesh. Symonds was sent home from the series and not picked for the tour of India in late 2008. He was rushed back in Australia and was involved in a pub scuffle while celebrating the first Test win, and he appeared in three more matches before undergoing knee surgery. A radio interview where he targeted Brendon McCullum was a factor in him being banned for the South Africa tour - along with his poor form for Queensland - and he was unconvincing in his one-day return in the United Arab Emirates. A breaking of team drinking rules led to his exit from the squad in England on the eve of the 2009 World Twenty20, and his Cricket Australia contract was soon cancelled. He retired from white clothes to become a Twenty20 specialist, playing for Queensland, Deccan Chargers and Surrey, and ultimately retired from all cricket in February 2012.']",['One-Day International Player of the Year - 2005'],26.0,41,5,1462.0,162*,40.61,2256,64.80,2,10,154,28,22.0,0.0,198.0,161,33,5088.0,156,39.75,5504,92.44,6,30,449,103,82.0,0.0,14.0,11,4,337.0,85*,48.14,199,169.34,0,2,33,10,3.0,0.0,227.0,376,33,14477,254*,42.20,,,40,65,,,159.0,0.0,424.0,377,51,11099,156,34.04,,,9,64,,,187.0,0.0,93.0,85,19,2141,117*,32.43,1453,147.35,2,12,194,83,42.0,0.0,26.0,41,2094,896,24.0,3/50,5/56,37.33,2.56,87.2,0,0,0,198.0,158,5935,4955,133.0,5/18,5/18,37.25,5.00,44.6,2,1,0,14.0,12,185,277,8.0,2/14,2/14,34.62,8.98,23.1,0,0,0,227.0,,17633,8714,242,6/105,,36.00,2.96,72.8,,2,0,424.0,,11714,9379,282,6/14,6/14,33.25,4.80,41.5,2,4,0,93.0,75,1237,1657,52,5/18,5/18,31.86,8.03,23.7,0,1,0,False,True,False,True

Smith's talent was apparent early, but as a young batsman he had more moving parts than an orchestra, only they didn't always work in harmony. He went away and worked on his game and returned to the Test side two years later with a much tighter technique. He still fidgeted between balls but could play every shot in the book, and a few more that defied words besides. Smith is quick-footed and adept at facing spin, but is equally comfortable driving and pulling the fast bowlers. His first Test century came at The Oval in the 2013 Ashes and his composure was apparent in the way he brought up the milestone with a six safely lofted down the ground. Over the next year he continued to improve and 2014-15 became the Summer of Steve, as he scored centuries in all four first innings of the home Tests against India. \n"", ""\nIt was also in the 2014-15 home summer that he became Australia's 45th Test captain, filling in for the injured Michael Clarke in three Tests. Despite being only 25 at the time his maturity in the role was evident, and the extra responsibility clearly didn't hamper his run-making. It became clear that Smith was to be Clarke's successor, a move that was confirmed after Clarke's retirement at the end of the 2015 Ashes in England. It was also clear that Smith had become the most important batsman in Australia's team; his 215 in the win at Lord's came after a promotion up the order to No.3.

With an unusual slinging action, and an aggressive approach, he was a fearsome sight to batsmen. He debuted against Pakistan in 1972-73, but hampered by a broken bone in his foot (which he hid from the selectors) was ineffective. Recalled in 1974-5, and forming a partnership with Dennis Lillee, he terrorised the England tourists with consistent spells of extreme fast bowling, taking 33 wickets in\nthe series. His action put considerable stress on his body, particularly his right shoulder, and he was rarely fit enough to reach those peaks again. He adapted his methods, relying less on pure pace, and more on an excellent cutter, and seam and swing. He was always capable of unleashing a very fast bouncer that\nwould skid and follow the batsman from only just short of a length. He remained with the Australian side when many left to join the Packer circus in 1977, and carried their attack through two series against England and India, but left to join WSC shortly afterwards.

Too hot for England in 1974-75 and West Indies the following season, a shoulder injury sustained in an on-field collision at Adelaide in November 1976 restricted him thereafter.

As a late addition to Australia's one-day squad in 2010, he unleashed a ball against England at Lord's that registered at 161.1kph, the second-fastest of all-time, but it was the consistent push for speed that crippled him regularly.

That looked set to be his international swansong as he retired from ODIs straight afterwards and quit state cricket later that year, but he remained active in the Big Bash League. Five years later, he was back in Australia\'s T20 team after a surprising recall in the lead-up to the 2016 World T20.

His unbeaten 130 against West Indies in Dominica also ensured that he would be part of Australia's starting XI for the 2015 Ashes series that followed, and although he struggled for impact in the first three Tests, he managed a pair of fifties towards the end of Australia's unsuccessful campaign.  \n"", ""\nNot only did Voges retain the faith of the selectors, after the post-Ashes retirements of Michael Clarke, Chris Rogers, Shane Watson and Brad Haddin, he was even made vice-captain to Steven Smith for the Test tour of Bangladesh in the absence of the newly-appointed vice-captain David Warner due to injury. Security concerns led to that series being postponed, but Voges made up for the lost opportunity by scoring 269*, 106* and 239 in three innings against West Indies and New Zealand in the 2015-16 season. He retired from international cricket on Valentine's Day 2017 - with an average of 61.87, the second highest for anyone after Donald Bradman among those to have played 20 matches - and then from domestic cricket a month later. "", ""\nVoges' promotion to the Test side came after a remarkable 2014-15 season in which he plundered 1358 runs at 104.46 in the Sheffield Shield, including six centuries from 11 matches. His numbers were so impressive that the selectors could not ignore him for the tour of the West Indies in 2015, nearly nine years after he had first been part of an Australian Test squad. In 2006-07 he was a surprise inclusion after the mid-Ashes retirement of Damien Martyn, but Voges did not debut during that series and until his mid-30s had to settle for being an ODI and T20 international cricketer. Even in those formats he was never really a fixture in the side, although there might have been a few more appearances had he not chosen to get married rather than joining Australia on their tour of South Africa in 2009. As it happened, it took him more than six years to reach 30 one-day internationals, despite averaging in the mid- to high-40s when given the chance. "", ""\nVoges had originally made his name with a 62-ball century in 2004-05, which was then the fastest in Australia's domestic one-day history. Not only did he break a record, he also clattered a sponsor's sign with one of seven sixes. Voges collected many plaudits for the innings and a $50,000 bonus for superb aim. He was named captain of Western Australia in 2012 having often filled the role previously in a stand-in capacity and was a semi-regular county cricketer during the off-season. Voges has played for Nottinghamshire, Middlesex and Hampshire. An effective T20 striker and athletic fieldsman, Voges has played in the IPL and the Caribbean Premier League, and captained the Perth Scorchers to the BBL title in 2014-15.\n"", '\n', ' \n']",['Australian Domestic Player of the Year - 2016'],20.0,31,7,1485.0,269*,61.87,2667,55.68,5,4,186,5,15.0,0.0,31.0,28,9,870.0,112*,45.78,998,87.17,1,4,61,10,7.0,0.0,7.0,5,2,139.0,51,46.33,114,121.92,0,1,8,2,3.0,0.0,211.0,351,52,13881,269*,46.42,27075,51.26,32,72,,,282.0,0.0,191.0,183,42,6130,112*,43.47,7700,79.61,5,47,,,80.0,0.0,180.0,168,37,4064,82*,31.02,3203,126.88,0,19,343,67,71.0,0.0,20.0,6,76,44,0.0,-,-,35.33,3.47,-,0,0,0,31.0,15,301,276,6.0,1/3,1/3,46.0,5.50,50.1,0,0,0,7.0,1,12,5,2.0,2/5,2/5,2.50,2.5,6.0,0,0,0,211.0,,3770,2021,56,4/92,,36.08,3.21,67.3,2,0,0,191.0,,1881,1604,39,3/20,3/20,41.12,5.11,48.2,0,0,0,180.0,56,566,754,27,2/4,2/4,27.92,7.99,20.9,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

At the start of his career it was hard to know whether he would develop into a nagging legspinner, aggressive middle-order batsman, intuitive skipper, or a bit of all three. After being tried as a Test leggie in India in 2008, it became apparent that batting was his focus and he developed into a destructive stroke-maker in the shorter formats. His maturity was recognised when he was named as Australia's Twenty20 captain in 2011. The appointment lasted only a year due to his batting form but it was a natural fit, for he had nearly a decade of captaincy experience having led Victoria in 2003-04 at the age of 20. The youngest skipper in their history, he won rave reviews for his cool head and warm handling of more hardened contemporaries. For all that, he remained a largely unassuming country lad. Picked to tour Zimbabwe when Stuart MacGill withdrew for moral reasons, White cancelled a fishing trip to attend the press conference then boyishly shrugged aside questions about the circumstances of his selection. He was chosen as much for his no-frills batting as his bowling; David Hookes, the late Victorian coach, felt White's best chance of representing Australia was to earn a top-six spot. \n"", 'White first emerged as a peculiarly unAustralian-style legspinner, tall and robust, relying on changes of pace and a handy wrong\'un rather than prodigious turn or flight. He would even start a spell with an offspinner or quicker ball. As far back as December 2002 his hero Shane Warne had predicted: ""I think he\'s a [future] Australian player provided he sticks to the way he plays and doesn\'t try to be someone different."" White made his ODI debut during the Super Series a year after missing a first Test cap when Nathan Hauritz was preferred in India. The retirement of Brad Hogg in early 2008 opened up an ODI spin position and White was given the first chance to secure the role. He even won a call-up to the Test squad in India when Victoria\'s first-choice leggie Bryce McGain went down with a shoulder injury. Despite his discomfort at being the No. 1 spinner, he held firm on debut while facing the best players of slow bowling in the business. As the series wore on it became clear he was not the answer to Australia\'s troubles and after four matches he was shifted aside with five wickets and 146 runs. It was time to try again as a batsman.', 'A clean striker of the ball who plundered ten centuries in two seasons of county cricket in 2006 and 2007, White has at times strangely struggled to convert his good starts into first-class hundreds back home. He did score 135 in the 2008-09 Sheffield Shield final against Queensland, though, and was relieved to lift the trophy after a series of near misses. He burst to life in 2009 with his first ODI century, 105 against England in Southampton, and another century came against Pakistan at home. White disappeared from the ODI side after being part of the 2011 World Cup squad but re-emerged in the T20 outfit in 2014 ahead of the World T20 in Bangladesh. The loss of the state captaincy to Matthew Wade for 2013-14 coincided with a strong personal campaign of 675 runs at 45.00, and any future internationals will certainly be as a batsman.\n', '\n']",['Australian Domestic Player of the Year - 2014'],4.0,7,2,146.0,46,29.2,330,44.24,0,0,15,1,1.0,0.0,91.0,77,16,2072.0,105,33.96,2586,80.12,2,11,145,45,37.0,0.0,47.0,44,14,984.0,85*,32.80,740,132.97,0,5,71,44,23.0,0.0,176.0,297,35,10494,260*,40.05,,,22,55,,,205.0,0.0,269.0,240,35,7703,165,37.57,9662,79.72,13,45,,,123.0,0.0,234.0,225,50,5433,141*,31.04,4290,126.64,2,35,378,227,96.0,0.0,4.0,8,558,342,5.0,2/71,3/119,68.4,3.67,111.6,0,0,0,91.0,19,331,351,12.0,3/5,3/5,29.25,6.36,27.5,0,0,0,47.0,5,42,51,1.0,1/11,1/11,51.00,7.28,42.0,0,0,0,176.0,,13754,8069,195,6/66,,41.37,3.51,70.5,,3,1,269.0,,4136,3729,104,4/15,4/15,35.85,5.40,39.7,4,0,0,234.0,42,484,708,26,4/10,4/10,27.23,8.77,18.6,1,0,0,False,False,False,False

Thrown to the wolves at 20, he flailed at all bowling, sent down bouncers at Viv Richards, and tasted Ashes defeat. Then he helped win a World Cup and made 393 runs before losing his wicket in England in 1989 - but admitted that he did not understand his own game, and 18 months later lost his place to his minutes-younger twin, Mark. It was his catharsis. Upon his recall, he minimalised his batsmanship, forgoing risk and waiting for the loose ball, which he still punished severely. He was all but forced to give up bowling by back problems. A series of epic innings ensued, none better than his 200 in Jamaica in 1994-95 to speed Australia to an historic series win, or his twin hundreds at Old Trafford to turn the 1997 Ashes series.  \n', ""He succeeded Mark Taylor as Test captain in 1999, and began with a torrid 2-2 draw in the Caribbean, but later led Australia boldly in 15 of their world-record 16 successive Test victories. With Shane Warne, he turned Australia's form around so completely in the 1999 World Cup that they won it, and he became (with Tom Moody) the first Australians to win the trophy twice. But he was denied the opportunity to defend his title when he was unceremoniously axed from the one-day side, like Taylor before him, following Australia's poor showing in the 2001-02 VB Series. He railed against his omission, but even he couldn't reverse it. "", ""He continued as Test captain, though, winning yet another Ashes series in 2002-03, and continuing (after frenzied debate) for the West Indian tour that followed Australia's 2003 World Cup win under Ricky Ponting. An inveterate sightseer, Waugh wrote a series of successful tour diaries, helped set up a charity for the daughters of lepers in Calcutta, and subscribed fervently to the power of the mind. At 36, he won the Allan Border Medal as Australia's best player of 2001.

His game was characterised by an ability to drive, cut, pull and loft the ball so effortlessly that it could make him look disdainful of the talents of bowlers. Waugh made his name as a middle-order player for New South Wales in the late 1980s, twice winning the Sheffield Shield Cricketer of the Year titles as he built and maintained a first-class average in excess of fifty. Although he lived in the shadow of his more famous brother for a number of seasons, progression to international cricket was inevitable. The only sour note when his promotion eventually came, for the fourth Test of the 1990-91 series against England, was that it arrived at Steve's expense. Critics took issue with Waugh's apparent loss of concentration at times and his capacity to occasionally succumb to lazy-looking shots. The weakness was on show most evidently during his disastrous 1992-93 tour to Sri Lanka when he scored four successive Test ducks, but it would be hard to find a player more difficult to\ncontain when in full flight. To complement his batting skills, he offered\nhandy part-time bowling as a medium-pacer-cum-offspinner and a remarkable\npenchant for spectacular saves and catches - he had few\nrivals to match his freakish brilliance in the field. His many\nhighlights included a world-record partnership of 464 for the fifth wicket with Steve for New South Wales\nagainst Western Australia in 1990-91; his sterling 138 on Test debut; three commanding centuries as an opener at\nthe 1996 World Cup tournament; and 126 to seal the Frank Worrell Trophy in West Indies in 1995. The\nlowest moment came in late 1998 when it emerged that he and Shane Warne accepted money\nfrom an Indian bookmaker during a tour of Sri Lanka four years earlier.\nA laconic, unassuming character, Waugh announced his retirement from\ninternational cricket without fuss in October 2002 after losing his\nplace in the Test squad to play England.

Despite boasting an athletic figure made for photo shoots, Watson's frame was so brittle it threatened to break him. He refused to give up. Not through recurrences of back stress fractures, hamstring strains, calf problems, hip complaints, a dislocated shoulder or a suspected heart attack that turned out to be food poisoning. He changed his training, preferring pilates to weights, gave up alcohol, but not his dream. It finally paid off in 2009, when he was chosen as a Test opener in the middle of the Ashes series. Many batsmen would have been uncomfortable with the promotion from the middle order, especially after failing when given the job with Queensland, but Watson had become used to re-inventing himself. With a history of setbacks, it was not a surprise that his first Test century became such a drama, but after two scores in the 90s and an 89, he finally brought it up at the MCG against Pakistan - thanks to a single from a dropped catch. He had earned some luck. A productive few years as a Test opener led to back-to-back Allan Border Medals but by 2011-12, injury had again interceded. He returned to the Test team in 2012 but spent the rest of his career floating up and down the order in search of a place to call his own. \n"", ""\nIn 2013, Watson became Australia's 44th Test captain when he led the team to a three-day loss in Delhi in place of the injured Michael Clarke. It completed a hectic couple of weeks for Watson, who had been suspended from the previous Test in the homework saga and had also flown home for the birth of his child. He gave up the vice-captaincy after that tour and played for another two years before being dropped during the 2015 Ashes, after which he announced his retirement from Tests. As a bowler, Watson developed into one of Australia's best exponents of reverse swing, and if he was not claiming wickets himself he was often building pressure at one end. At times his bowling saved his place in the Test team, for four centuries from 59 Tests and an average of 35.19 was a little less than he desired as a batsman. At the crease he is an aggressive brute with a broad chest, a right-handed disciple of Matthew Hayden, and someone who often doesn't need to follow-through to gain a boundary. However, his drives and pulls are delivered in a much smoother style. Always a dangerous striker in the shorter formats, Watson clubbed Bangladesh for 185 in a 50-over contest in April 2011, the highest score ever by an Australian batsman in ODI cricket. The Player of the Tournament at the 2012 World T20, Watson retired from all international cricket at the end of the 2016 tournament.\n"", '\n']","['Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year - 2002', 'Australian One-Day International Player of the Year - 2010,2011, 2012', 'Australian Test Player of the Year - 2011', 'Allan Border Medal - 2010,2011', 'Australian Twenty20 International Player of the Year - 2012, 2013']",59.0,109,3,3731.0,176,35.19,7094,52.59,4,24,483,31,45.0,0.0,190.0,169,27,5757.0,185*,40.54,6365,90.44,9,33,570,131,64.0,0.0,58.0,56,6,1462.0,124*,29.24,1006,145.32,1,10,115,83,20.0,0.0,137.0,241,19,9451,203*,42.57,,,20,54,,,109.0,0.0,265.0,241,36,7915,185*,38.60,9187,86.15,11,46,,,88.0,0.0,300.0,292,33,7784,124*,30.05,5595,139.12,6,45,677,411,86.0,0.0,59.0,93,5495,2526,75.0,6/33,6/51,33.68,2.75,73.2,1,3,0,190.0,163,6466,5342,168.0,4/36,4/36,31.79,4.95,38.4,3,0,0,58.0,49,930,1187,48.0,4/15,4/15,24.72,7.65,19.3,1,0,0,137.0,,12164,6294,210,7/69,,29.97,3.10,57.9,,7,1,265.0,,8406,7063,213,4/36,4/36,33.15,5.04,39.4,3,0,0,300.0,231,4429,5838,216,4/15,4/15,27.02,7.90,20.5,3,0,0,False,True,True,True

If his bat isn't doing the talking his mouth probably is, and either way you can expect an assertive approach. One of the most destructive hitters in world cricket, Warner opens for Australia in all three formats and in 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching England's Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had also been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It also completed a remarkable rise for a man who burst on to the international scene in 2008-09 as a Twenty20 specialist; he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well. \n"", ""\nHis debut in the baggy green came, appropriately, in Test match No.2020, against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2011, and in his second match he achieved what Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden never did - he carried his bat through a Test innings. His unbeaten 123 in Hobart could not prevent a historic New Zealand win, but his patience in challenging conditions showed a different side to his batsmanship. Later in the same summer he made a very different kind of hundred, a 69-ball ton against India at the WACA that turned into a career-best 180. Over the next few years he became one of the most productive performers in Australia's Test order, and in 2014 he scored twin hundreds in the Cape Town Test against South Africa and then repeated the feat in Adelaide against India, in what was an especially emotional match as Australia returned to cricket following the death of Phillip Hughes.

A charismatic, spectacular performer who made as headlines on the field and off it, he finished second-best to Muttiah Muralitharan in the Test wickets stakes, but to many he remains the greatest spinner - if not bowler - of them all.  ","['\nAt first there were nerves and chubbiness. Then came wild soaring legbreaks, followed by fame and flippers. For a long while there were women, then a bookmaker, then diet pills, then more women - and headlines, always headlines. Now he has come out the other end, his bluff and bluster and mischief and innocence somehow intact. The man who in 2000 was rated among the five greatest cricketers of the 20th century was, in 2006, bowling better than ever. \n', ""When Warne likened his life to a soap opera he was selling himself short. His story was part fairytale, part pantomime, part hospital drama, part adult's-only romp, part glittering awards ceremony. He took a Test hat-trick, won the Man-of-the-Match prize in a World Cup final and was the subject of seven books. He was the first cricketer to reach 700 Test wickets. He swatted more runs than any other Test player without making a hundred, and was probably the wiliest captain Australia never had. His ball that gazoodled Mike Gatting in 1993, bouncing outside leg stump and cuffing off, is unanimously esteemed the most famous in history. He revived legspin, thought to be extinct, and is now pre-eminent in a game so transformed that we sometimes wonder where the next champion fast bowlers will come from."", ""For all that, Warne's greatest feats are perhaps those of the last couple of years of his career. Returning in 2004 from a 12-month hiatus for swallowing forbidden diuretics, he swept aside 26 Sri Lankan batsmen in three Tests, and the following year scalped a world record 96 victims - a stunning 24 more than in his show-stopping 1993 - and still missed out on the Allan Border Medal. Forty of those were Englishmen in what sometimes appeared to be a lone stand in a thrilling Ashes series. At the end he was helped by his stockpile of straight balls: a zooter, slider, toppie and back-spinner, one that drifted in, one that sloped out, and another that didn't budge. Yet he seldom got his wrong'un right and rarely landed his flipper. More than ever he relied on his two oldest friends: excruciating accuracy and an exquisite legbreak, except that he controlled the degree of spin - and mixed it - at will. Like the great classical painters, he stumbled upon the art of simplicity. His bowling was never simpler, nor more effective, nor lovelier to look at."", ""Maybe, as with Posh Spice or Kylie Minogue, Warne is more famous than he is loved.

Small, cheeky, popular and multi-skilled, he would drink all night without getting drunk then wipe sleep from his eyes to make a shot-laden century or take a crucial wicket or stunning catch - sometimes, in folklore at least, on the same day. Sometimes cricket is not even the tale's focus. Michael Clarke, who is often compared to Walters, knows him only as a great bloke instead of a great batsman. It is a shame. He was more than a person whose card games were interrupted by falls of wicket. \n"", 'Walters, the country boy with the bush technique, was a knockabout who disliked training and going to bed early, and favoured drinking, smoking, solitaire and cribbage. Quick on to the back foot against the spinners, he was a fine straight-driver and hooker, and a valuable partnership breaker with his medium pace. Crowds relaxed and related to his instinctive and aggressive Test batting that three times brought up centuries in a session, the most famous arriving when he smacked the last ball of the day from Bob Willis for six at the WACA in 1974-75. He could play pressure innings as well, like the 112 against West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1972-93, when Lance Gibbs had three short-legs by 35 minutes on day one and Walters scored 100 between lunch and tea. ""By any standards it was a magnificent innings,"" ', ' reported. The grit never stuck to his stories, forcing him to open his autobiography with a spoiler. ""It rather amuses me when journalists refer to me as happy-go-lucky and unflappable. I feel the pressures and tensions as much as the next bloke.""', ""Growing up on a Dungog dairy farm in country New South Wales, Walters stepped from the paddock into first-class cricket at 17, where he faced the great Wes Hall and reached 50. Like Clarke, he made a century on debut two years later. A second Ashes hundred came in the next match as he followed 155 with 22 and 115 in a sparkling start that was upturned in 1966 by conscription for two years' national service. He was not called up for duty in Vietnam, and smoothly swapped training greens to whites. Re-sealing his place with 699 runs in four matches against West Indies in 1968-69, he became the first player to make a double-hundred and a hundred in a Test."", 'Walters was a fixture of the team until 1977, his fourth Ashes tour, and he joined World Series Cricket, playing most of his matches upcountry, before a surprise recall against India in 1980-81. Missing out on a century in England remains his career\'s biggest hole. Using a high back-lift and a light bat, he was susceptible to the swinging ball, and retired after being overlooked for the 1981 Ashes tour. However, his highest score came in the similar conditions of New Zealand. Celebrating his first century overnight, the tour manager was called in the early hours because the hotelier wanted the bar closed. Walters backed up the following evening after reaching 250 from 342 balls and putting on 217 with the No. 8 Gary Gilmour. Another time he borrowed a spectator\'s bike to ride from third-man at each end after being punished by Ian Chappell for oversleeping. There are so many Walters stories that many of them must be true, and as a man of the people he was rewarded with a stand on the old SCG hill. ""There will never be another like him,"" Dennis Lillee said. ""I never saw him throw a bat, never heard him talk badly of anyone. He was so cool."" He could bat, too.

He was relentlessly competitive, invariably aggressive, and as hard and uncompromising as the new ball. After an international career that lasted almost 15 years, the end was desperately unfortunate, as Boucher was forced to announce his retirement after being hit in the eye by a bail in a warm-up game on the tour to England in 2012, which would have been his last series anyway. Boucher finished with 998 international dismissals as a wicketkeeper, including 555 in 147 Tests. \n', ""Boucher's start in international cricket was uncertain. His relative lack of pure wicketkeeping skill and ability was exposed on South Africa's 1998 tour to England when he was repeatedly undone by the swing of the ball after it had pitched. However, Boucher had no peer in terms of temperament, guts and determination, and he duly fashioned himself into one of the finest glovemen in the game. He could often be seen, long after the rest of the squad had hit the showers after a training session, willing himself through another set of wicketkeeping drills. The hard work paid off, and he is likely to hold the record for Test dismissals - among many others - long after his retirement. "", ""As a batsman Boucher lived for the big moment, the quick 30 or 40 his team needed to win a match, or the session that had to be spent at the crease to ensure a draw. His most memorable innings was probably the scintillating unbeaten 50 he scored to complete South Africa's surge to a series-clinching target of 438 for 9 off the penultimate ball of a one-day international against Australia in Johannesburg in March 2006. "", 'Boucher strutted through 75 consecutive Tests before the suits thought he needed to be brought down a peg or two and dropped him for the tour to India in 2004. His reality duly checked, he returned to the national team as the ultimate man for the trenches. In the autumn of his career, his renewed commitment to his conditioning earned him extra years at the top, and helped him become the first wicketkeeper to take 500 catches in Test cricket. ', 'For a man who loomed so large in the world of cricket, Boucher started small. He was invariably smaller, and younger, than anyone else in the age-group provincial teams he played in. But the neon intensity in his eyes in the otherwise banal team photographs told of a kid who meant business. Boucher was a junior South African squash champion, and famously once played a national final with a racquet arm that had not long before emerged from a plaster cast. He lost, but in five games.

However, his side was inexperienced (Yallop himself was an eight-Test ""veteran"" before the series), and the tourists powered to a 5-1 victory under Mike Brearley\'s keen leadership.  Injuries and the Australian side\'s re-integration after WSC reduced Yallop\'s international appearances in the early-mid 1980s, and his decision to join rebel tours of South Africa from 1985 led to the end of his first-class career.  His talent, however, was on full display in the 1983-84 five-Test series against Pakistan, where he accumulated 554 runs at 92.33, including a marathon innings of 268 in the fourth Test at the MCG.\n', ' \n']",[],39.0,70,3,2756.0,268,41.13,,,8,9,276,1,23.0,0.0,30.0,27,6,823.0,66*,39.19,1288,63.89,0,7,64,3,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,164.0,283,30,11615,268,45.90,,,30,57,,,120.0,1.0,73.0,68,11,1752,91,30.73,,,0,12,,,9.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39.0,10,192,116,1.0,1/21,1/21,116.0,3.62,192.0,0,0,0,30.0,4,138,119,3.0,2/28,2/28,39.66,5.17,46.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,164.0,,1514,876,14,4/63,,62.57,3.47,108.1,,0,0,73.0,,406,340,6,2/28,2/28,56.66,5.02,67.6,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

With his wristy leg-side flick and serene cover drive, Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket, while also effectively shifting gears to become the fastest batsman to 2,000 (40 innings), 3,000 (57 innings), 4,000 (81 innings) and 5,000 (101 innings) runs in ODI cricket.  \n"", ""Amla's career began at Durban High School, the alma mater of Lance Klusener and Barry Richards, and a world away from his brother, Ahmed. Just four years apart, they grew up on either side of the Apartheid divide, which meant that Ahmed went to a school for the previously disadvantaged, while Amla was afforded better opportunity at a more prestigious institution. "", 'After a successful school career, Amla toured New Zealand with the South African Under-19 team in 2000-01 and captained them at the 2002 Under-19 World Cup. After reeling off four centuries in his first eight innings of the 2004-05 season - in which he was also appointed, and stepped down as, Dolphins captain - he was picked to play for South Africa against India.  ', 'He was not an instant success, with serious questions emerging about his technique and his back lift, in particular, as he mustered 36 runs in four innings against England later that season.', ""When he was handed a second chance, he made it count with 149 against New Zealand at Cape Town, helping South Africa to a draw. He remained a consistent performer, even if not as prolific as South Africa would have liked, and made fifties against Pakistan in 2007. But he saved his best for the following year's tour of India, where he racked up 307 runs in three Tests. That included a majestic 159 in Chennai, his second score of 150 or more. He followed that with a pugnacious 81 in the second innings, in conditions that were trying, thanks to the weather, the pitch and the attack. In the summer of 2008, he got his name on the honours board at Lord's with a sublime century, and, in the process, silenced all whimpers about his pedigree for the longest version."", 'Still, doubts remained over his ability in the shorter formats, but Amla corrected that in 2010. He scored over 1,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket.  It started with a magnum opus tour of India, where the hosts threw everything at him, but could not find a way past his monk-like patience and ability to soak pressure. In the two-Test series, he scored 490 runs and was dismissed just once. In ODIs, he combined quick scoring with stunning consistency, scoring five centuries and four fifties in 15 innings, all the while scoring at over a run a ball, which saw him rise to No.1 in the ODI rankings that year.', ""He was promoted to South Africa's leadership core when he was named vice-captain of the ODI and T20 international teams in June 2011, and later that year, scored centuries in both Tests South Africa played against Australia at home. But Amla's crowning moment came the following year, when he got South Africa's quest to become the No.1-ranked Test team off to an epic start, spending 13 hours and 10 minutes at the Oval crease crafting a triple hundred, and not even needing a change of gloves. Amla also scored a century at Lord's as South Africa took the Test mace from the hosts. "", ""A quickfire 196 against Australia in Perth ensured South Africa stayed on top, and in February 2013, Amla was the ICC's top-ranked Test batsman. He had also decided to keep away from captaincy promotions, and stepped down as the limited-overs vice-captain. "", 'That was why it came as a surprise when, less than 18 months later, Amla accepted the Test captaincy. His tenure was off to a solid start as South Africa beat Sri Lanka 1-0 away from home in his first series in charge, and West Indies at home in his second, in which Amla scored a double hundred in the first match. But that proved a false dawn.', ""Amla had taken over a team in transition and South Africa's struggles came in 2015. They lost a four-Test series in India 3-0 and returned home to lose the opening Test against England. Amla's own form also suffered and he had not crossed fifty in a year. The New Year's Test of 2016 brought a change of fortune as he scored a double hundred, having decided to give up captaincy. He announced that he was stepping down after the Test was drawn.""]",[],124.0,215.0,16.0,9282.0,311*,46.64,18573.0,49.97,28.0,41.0,1170.0,14.0,108.0,0.0,174.0,171,12,7910.0,159,49.74,8865,89.22,27,37,806,53,83.0,0.0,44.0,44,6,1277.0,97*,33.60,967,132.05,0,8,146,26,19.0,0.0,237.0,396,31,17765,311*,48.67,,,52,88,,,185.0,0.0,236.0,230,14,9770,159,45.23,,,30,50,,,104.0,0.0,146.0,145,14,4192,104*,32.00,3286,127.57,2,27,446,89,37.0,0.0,124.0,5,54,37,0.0,-,-,35.33,4.11,-,0,0,0,174.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,32.91,-,-,-,-,-,44.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,237.0,,393,277,1,1/10,,277.00,4.22,393.0,0,0,0,236.0,,16,28,0,-,-,-,10.50,-,0,0,0,146.0,2,2,5,0,-,-,-,15.00,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

His father Martin represented Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe); his brothers Brett and Boyd both played for Natal B, but it was Dale who first played for and captained both Natal Schools and South African Schools before making his debut for Natal in 1993-94 and the national team in 1998. At an early stage Dale showed his captaincy skills and was at one stage earmarked as the successor to Hansie Cronje as South Africa captain. Benkenstein played 23 ODIs, the last against Bangladesh in Benoni in 2002, but was never a regular member of the national side and for some reason was never selected to play Test cricket. Dale agrees that he never took advantage of the chances that did come his way. \n', 'Wrongly regarded as solely a one-day specialist for a time, Benkenstein has scored close to 10,000 limited-overs runs and has one hundred as a middle order batsman. He is also more than useful with the ball as a third change bowler. ', 'His first-class career speaks volumes for his ability. He has scored over 15,000 runs at an average around 45. He also boasts over 100 wickets with his seamers and has the reputation of being a partnership breaker. ', ""Having captained Natal and the Dolphins, Benkenstein was made Durham's captain for the 2006 season. He had arrived at the county the season before, after Durham had finished bottom of the Championship for the fifth time in their 13 years as a first-class county. Benkenstein's arrival was an important factor in Durham's coming of age, and in 2007 they won the Friends Provident Trophy and were runners-up in the Championship - and Benkenstein ceased to be a Kolpak as he acquired a British passport. In 2008, the Championship was won for the first time after an innings victory over Kent. "", ""Benkenstein stepped down as captain at the end of that season, handing the reins over to Will Smith, but remained as a valuable member of the side in all three formats and was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2009. His 2011 season was the most productive of his career in England, yielding 1,366 runs at 59.39, including four centuries and a further nine half-centuries. He became Durham's all-time highest run-scorer having overtaken Jon Lewis's mark of 7,854 during the 2011 season.

He came out second best in his duels with Shane Warne, but although much was made of the animosity between the two, a more sober assessment of Cullinan suggests that his failures on two Australian tours were largely the result of an almost desperate desire to prove himself against a cricketing nation he holds in high regard. In other words, Cullinan tried just too hard to succeed against Australia. Against all other attacks in all kinds of conditions he scored runs, as demonstrated by his century in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Galle in 2000 when his hundred came against Muttiah Mularitharan, the world\'s best offspinner, operating on a turning track. In 1994, when South Africa were decimated by Devon Malcolm and bowled out for 175, Cullinan made a graceful 94 and was the only South African not to lose his wicket to Malcolm. Equally adept against pace or spin, Cullinan had the priceless gift of timing. He made even a forward defensive prod look stylish. He took some time, it is true, to shake off a reputation earned as a schoolboy as the ""new Graeme Pollock"", a label tagged on him when he broke Pollock\'s record as South Africa\'s youngest first-class centurion. During the 1990s, however, Cullinan set the South African mark for the highest first-class score (337 not out against Northern Transvaal in 1993) and at Eden Park in 1999 he edged past Pollock\'s highest Test score of 274 by one run to claim the then South African record. Cullinan made 14 Test hundreds in all. More importantly, he accepted the role of senior batsman, and it is surely no coincidence that when he scored first-innings hundreds in the first and fourth Tests against England in 1999-00, South Africa went on to win both matches. Cullinan tried to opt out of one-day cricket at the end of the 2001 season, but the board, understandably, put pressure on him to sign a new two-year contract. However, he retired from all international cricket in 2002 under a cloud of dispute with the board. Recalled that season to play Australia after recovering from a knee injury and a lack of form, he suddenly withdrew from the team on the eve of the second Test. It was later revealed that the board had had been unable to meet certain demands made by Cullinan. He subsequently retracted his retirement, but the board found itself able to resist the temptation to bring him back. In 2007, Cullinan took up a coaching role with the ICL.

He was a quickish offspinner who was well-suited to the one-day game with his sparky batting and lively fielding providing a useful all-round package. His international chance arrived during a one-day tournament in Pakistan during 1994-95, but he failed to take a wicket in his first five matches. He finally broke his wicket-taking duck in Kenya and chipped in with useful scalps without ever threatening to run through a team - a common story among South Africa spinners - and was never offered a chance in the Test side. His penultimate overseas tour was the infamous trip to India in 1999-00 where the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal hit the news. During the King Commission hearing it emerged that Cronje had agreed with bookmakers that Crookes would open the bowling. He did so in Nagpur, in the fifth one-day international, and conceded 69 runs off 10 overs, later admitting his astonishment at being asked.

He\nwas just 32. Two years earlier, Hansie Cronje's admission that he took bribes from\nbookmakers to provide information and fix matches exposed the extent of a corruption\nscandal that cricket authorities had signally neglected to confront. \n"", 'At first he had hotly denied charges levelled by the New Delhi police, who during\na phone-tapping operation in March 2000 heard him conspiring with an Indian bookmaker, Sanjeev Chawla, to predetermine performances. And such was his standing as a player, captain and sporting ambassador for post-apartheid South Africa that few in the cricket world doubted him, preferring to heap scorn on the Indian investigation.', 'Ali Bacher, managing director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa, spoke of\nCronje\'s ""unquestionable integrity and honesty"". Then, four days after the accusation,\nCronje confessed in a 3 a.m. phone call to Bacher that he had not been ""entirely\nhonest"". He was immediately stripped of the captaincy, as his side prepared for a oneday series against Australia, and in subsequent testimony to the government-appointed King Commission revealed, sometimes in tears, further details of his involvement with bookmakers in match-fixing. The cricket world listened agog as much as aghast. The game\'s reputation, it seemed, was at an all-time low. Cronje\'s life and career were in tatters.', ""It had been so different a decade earlier when, aged 21, he was given the captaincy\nof Orange Free State. His upbringing and education had groomed him for leadership.\nHis family were of solid, middle-class Afrikaner stock, deeply religious and sporty:\nHansie's father, Ewie, had been an off-spinning all-rounder for Free State in the 1960s."", 'The importance of discipline, dedication and hard work had been inculcated in Hansie\nat an early age, honed at Grey College in his native Bloemfontein, and was made\nmanifest in 1991-92, his second year in charge, when the young Free State team,\ncoached by Eddie Barlow to a level of physical and mental fitness rare even for South\nAfrican cricket, finished runners-up in the Castle Bowl (formerly the Currie Cup) and\nwon the limited-overs Nissan Shield. The next two seasons brought Castle Cup and\none-day doubles, followed by one-day trophies in subsequent years - a total of seven\ntitles in five seasons. International commitments meant the young captain was not everpresent, but his influence remained inspirational.', ""He had made his debut at 18 in January 1988, joining his brother, Frans, for the\nCurrie Cup games against Transvaal and Northern Transvaal. Innings of two and 16,\nthen a pair, were an inauspicious start for someone who would notch up a record 15\nfirst-class hundreds for the Free State, as well as six in one-day competitions. The\nfollowing season, his unbeaten 105 against Impalas took Orange Free State into the\nBenson and Hedges Trophy final, where Frans's old school-friend Allan Donald blew\nWestern Province aside with four for 18. Hansie's maiden first-class hundred followed\nin January 1990 when, captaining South African Universities, he hit 104 against Mike\nGatting's English rebels."", ""Inside the year, South Africa had been readmitted to full membership of the ICC,\nand the 22-year-old Cronje was one of four non-playing observers - two white, two\nnon-white - taken to India with the first post-isolation side. Three months later, he\nwas bowling five tidy overs for 17 as South Africa, captained by Kepler Wessels,\nshocked Australia with a nine-wicket victory at Sydney in the World Cup. He played\nin eight of their nine games in that tournament, including the infamous semi-final\nagainst England in which South Africa's target was adjusted after rain from 22 off 13\nballs to 21 off one. Then he went to the Caribbean for South Africa's first Test since\nreadmission, and their first ever against West Indies. Cronje scored only five and two,\nbut in 68 Tests would go on to make 3,714 runs at 36.41, as well as taking 43 wickets\nat 29.95; in 188 one-day internationals he made 5,565 runs at 38.64, took 114 wickets\nat 34.78 with an economy rate of 4.44, and held 72 catches. His first-class figures\nfrom 184 games were 12,103 runs at 43.69 and 116 wickets at 34.43."", 'With his aggressive batting, intelligent medium-pace bowling and brilliant fielding,\nCronje was a formidable competitor. The Indians discovered as much when they visited', ""South Africa in 1992-93 and he took a career-best five for 32 in the opening one-day\ninternational, won it with a six with three balls to spare, and conceded only 3.59 an\nover in the seven-match series. That tour also proved he had the mettle for Test cricket.\nGoing in in the second over at Port Elizabeth, he stayed eight and three-quarter hours\n(411 balls) until he was last out for 135, the first and highest of his six Test centuries.\nWhen Donald took his match haul to 12 wickets, South Africa had their first Test\nvictory of the new era. Cronje's second hundred, 122, came in Colombo the following\nSeptember to set up South Africa's biggest Test win - an innings and 208 runs - and\nSri Lanka's heaviest defeat."", ""His good form initially held when, the youngest in the side at 24, he was Wessels's\nvice-captain in Australia in 1994-95. After Wessels broke a finger in the Sydney Test,\nCronje took charge on the tense final morning to such effect that Australia, chasing\n117 for victory with six wickets in hand, were dismissed for 111; his direct hit to run\nout Shane Warne from wide mid-off struck a crucial blow. He also took over during\nthe one-day tournament when further injuries forced Wessels home, and at Adelaide\nbecame South Africa's second-youngest Test captain, after Murray Bisset in 1898-99.\nBut there was no fairytale: Australia won by 191 runs to square the series."", ""Wessels was captain again when the two countries resumed hostilities in South Africa,\nand Cronje wasted no time extracting revenge for Adelaide. In six games in 14 days,\nhe hammered the Aussie bowling for 721 runs: he began with 112 from 120 balls, the\nhigher of his two one-day international hundreds, hit 251, his maiden double-hundred,\nfor Orange Free State and finished with 122 in the First Test, which South Africa won\nby 197 runs. The double-hundred - next highest score was Gerry Liebenberg's 39 -\nremained Cronje's best."", ""This was a period of transition for Australian fast bowling, though. Cronje was given\na harder time in England in 1994 and managed only 90 runs in six Test innings as\nDevon Malcolm and the young Darren Gough exposed a technical weakness against\nshort-pitched bowling directed at his ribs. Spin gave him no such problems, and his\narmoury against it included a ferocious slog-sweep over mid-wicket, played on one\nknee. When he made what was then Test cricket's third-fastest fifty, off 31 balls at\nCenturion in 1997-98, he reached it by hitting Muttiah Muralitharan, the world's best\noff-spinner, for 4666 off successive balls."", 'In 1995, he expunged his unhappy introduction to English conditions by making\n1,362 first-class runs at 50.44 in a one-off season for Leicestershire, whose cricket\nmanager Jack Birkenshaw and all-rounder Gordon Parsons, Cronje\'s brother-in-law\nsince 1991, participated in Orange Free State\'s triumphs. Among his four hundreds\nwas 213 against Somerset at Weston-super-Mare. But it would take him ten Tests and\nuntil 1998 to reach 50 against England, whereupon he did so five times on the trot: 81 in South Africa\'s win at Lord\'s, 69 not out at Old Trafford, 126 and 67 at Trent\nBridge, and 57 (plus a duck) at Headingley, where England took the series 2-1 with\nhelp from some inept umpiring. He was South Africa\'s top-scorer, with 401 runs at\n66.83, but it was generally accepted that his unenterprising captaincy had let the rubber\nslip away. Instead of penetration he went for strangulation, setting defensive fields for\nhis seam bowlers and encouraging them to bowl wide of off stump: what Bob Woolmer, South Africa\'s coach, called ""aggressive containment"".', ""Yet when Cronje succeeded Wessels in 1994-95, and began the partnership with\nWoolmer that masterminded South Africa's tactics until the 1999 World Cup, he was\nwelcomed as an adventurous captain; one prepared to gamble. In his first series, against New Zealand in South Africa, he became the first captain since W. G. Grace to win a three-match rubber after being one down. When the teams met again at Auckland\nin March 1995, Cronje's pre-lunch declaration, setting New Zealand 275 to win in 63\novers, was the catalyst for South Africa's 93-run victory. Something saturnine in his\ndemeanour, however, spoke of arrogance and calculated self-control; his dour expression suggested few concessions to humour or emotion. Yet there were times when the composure snapped. "", ""Shortly after becoming South Africa's captain, he received a onematch ban for dissent on dismissal in a Castle Cup game. When the umpires rightly ruled Mark Waugh not out after inadvertently hitting his wicket at Adelaide in 1997-98, and he went on to save the Test, Cronje hurled a stump through their dressingroom door. At Cape Town in 1995-96, he was fined for imposing his will on umpire Dave Orchard to refer a run-out to the television umpire after Orchard ruled England's Graham Thorpe not out; the decision was overturned and South Africa went on to take the match and the series."", 'He could certainly be articulate and persuasive. The England bowler Angus Fraser\nrecalled him holding an audience in thrall for 40 minutes, without notes, and reciting\n""word for word"" from Hamlet. ""His pre-match talks were often inspirational,"" Woolmer\nsaid, ""and he led from the front."" His players revered him. The Western Province seamer Craig Matthews credited Cronje with changing his life: ""He actually persuaded me that I was good enough to play international cricket."" At Cronje\'s funeral, Shaun\nPollock, his successor as national captain, spoke of his love of practical jokes, often\nused to make newcomers feel at home. Pollock recounted being told to field next to\na certain sponsor\'s advert, only to discover the sponsor had boards scattered all round\nthe ground. As with most great leaders, Cronje\'s personality comprised a complex\nskein of qualities.', ""His captaincy record brooks few arguments. South Africa won 27 and lost only 11\nof his 53 Tests in charge, with series victories over every opponent except Australia;\nin 138 one-day internationals there were 99 wins, as well as a tie. His record made\na nonsense of the South African board's decision to appoint him for only the first two\nTests against England in 1999-2000, even allowing for a downturn in his form and\nhis apprehensions about the UCBSA's politically motivated policy of selection on\nracial quotas. Although he was later confirmed as captain for all the Tests and\none-day games, his take on the turn of events was apparent in his brooding presence\nand the fact that he openly flirted with an offer to succeed Duncan Fletcher as\nGlamorgan coach."", ""He was still coming to terms, too, with that cataclysmic tie against Australia that\ncost South Africa a place in the 1999 World Cup final and dashed his boyhood dreams\nof leading his country to World Cup glory. With one run needed to win their semi-\nfinal, and three balls still in hand, South Africa's last pair, Lance Klusener and Donald,\ncontrived the most fatal of run-outs. Cronje, who had been given out for a duck caught\noff his boot, was magnanimous in defeat as ever, but nothing could mask his anguish.\nAustralia remained his bête noire."", ""He did outdo his Australian rivals Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh in winning a Test\nseries in India, in 2000. South Africa won 2-0 and ended India's sequence of 14\nunbeaten home series since 1987. But in that moment of triumph the seeds of his\ntragedy were quickly taking root. Ensnared in illicit dealings with sub-continental\nbookmakers after Mohammad Azharuddin introduced him to the match-fixer M. K.\nGupta on South Africa's previous tour of India, in 1996, Cronje was now in cahoots\nwith Sanjeev Chawla. Cronje unsuccessfully approached Pieter Strydom to underperform"", ""in the First Test; before the Second he asked Mark Boucher, Jacques Kallis\nand Klusener if they were interested in throwing the game for money. They put it down\nas another of Hansie's practical jokes. It was not until the final one-day game at Nagpur\nthat he struck lucky, getting Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams to play to plan for\n$US15,000 apiece. Gibbs was supposed to be out for less than 20 and Williams to\nconcede more than 50. That the plan went awry was ethically immaterial. He had lured\ntwo non-white players, the most vulnerable of his charges in socio-economic terms, at\nthe very time he was supporting South Africa's development programme to bring young\nblack cricketers into the first-class game. When it emerged that he told Chawla he\nneeded $US25,000 for each player, so guaranteeing himself a $US20,000 cut, Cronje's\ngreed was compliant with his guilt. Gibbs and Williams subsequently received sixmonth suspensions from international cricket."", ""Granted immunity from prosecution, Cronje told the King Commission he received\naround $US140,000 from bookmakers, including $US110,000 from Gupta for information on team selection, daily forecasts and when he would declare against India at Cape Town in January 1997. He denied ever fixing the actual result of a match. He\nalso admitted telling the South African team, before the Mohinder Amarnath benefit\ngame at Mumbai in December 1996, that there was $US200,000 (some sources said\n$250,000) on the table if they played badly. The team actually debated whether to\naccept the money before rejecting it; no one reported the matter to the authorities.\nSome of them thought the offer of a bribe reflected South Africa's coming of age in\ninternational cricket."", 'When Cronje rejected further advances from Gupta in November 1997, that might\nhave ended his perfidy. But, as he told Justice King, he had ""an unfortunate love of\nmoney... I am not addicted to alcohol or nicotine, but I believe this is very similar to\nan alcohol problem."" Even so, it was small beer, certainly in terms of personal gain,\nthat made him come off the wagon in January 2000. In response to a late-night\nvisit from a South African bookmaker, Marlon Aronstam, he persuaded Nasser Hussain\nto make a match of the rain-ruined Centurion Test on the fifth day with a double\nforfeiture of innings - something not only without precedent in Test history but also\noutside the Laws. Aronstam had planned to back both sides at long odds and, even\nthough the forfeiture deal was struck too late for him to place his bets, Cronje was\ngiven 53,000 rand (approximately £5,000) and a leather jacket for his wife. He was\nalso acclaimed for his enterprising captaincy by unsuspecting commentators who\nwelcomed England\'s win - South Africa had already taken the series - as a victory\nfor common sense and the game. A fortnight later Cronje was meeting Chawla in\nDurban and leaving his hotel room with some $US15,000 tucked in a mobile-phone\ncontainer. The die was cast. Neither Justice King nor many others believed they had heard the full story, but enough was known for Cronje to receive a life ban from all cricketing activities. The Qayyum Report had already recommended a life ban for Pakistan\'s former captain Salim Malik; India\'s Azharuddin and Ajay Sharma would receive similar sentences before the year was out. And the ICC would eventually publish their own report into corruption in the game and implement a range of measures designed to keep the bookmakers at bay.', 'Meanwhile the most intriguing question - why he did it - remained an enigma. In\nmulti-media interviews between his testimony and his ban in October, reputed to\nhave netted a further £100,000, Cronje talked of ""greed, stupidity and the lure of\neasy money"" and claimed ""I was arrogant enough to think I would get away with it"".\nA born-again Christian who wore a bracelet with the initials WWJD - What Would\nJesus Do? - he talked of how Satan had entered his world when he took his eyes\noff Jesus and his ""whole world turned dark"". There was something pre-Christian in\nthis, an echo of Greek heroes blaming the gods rather than themselves for their\nmisfortunes.', 'Cronje\'s appeal against his life ban was rejected by the Pretoria High Court in\nOctober 2001, and while there was talk of his having some future role in cricket,\nmaybe coaching or in the media, he began to build a life away from the game. He\nenrolled on a Masters degree course, and in February 2002 joined the Johannesburgbased firm Bell Equipment, which specialised in earth-moving machinery, as financial manager. At the time of his death he was commuting weekly to and from his home on the exclusive Fancourt Estate in George. That fateful weekend, he had hitched a ride with the two pilots of an Air Quarius Hawker Siddeley turboprop after his scheduled flight had been grounded by a hailstorm - a risk-taker to the end.\nMore than a thousand mourners filled the Grey College Chapel for Cronje\'s funeral,\nwhile a thousand more outside watched the service, which was televised nationally, on\nlarge screens. It was reported that members of the UCBSA, critical earlier of their\ncaptain\'s betrayal, had been told they would not be welcome, but Bertha Cronje,\nHansie\'s widow, said he would not have agreed with such a ban. The divisions were\nforgotten as South Africa, a nation rebuilding on forgiveness and reconciliation,\nmourned, in Gary Kirsten\'s words, ""a great cricketer, a great performer and a great\non-field leader of his country"".

A natural leader, du Plessis was put in charge of the T20 side in February 2013 and formed part of the senior core in other formats.  \n"", 'All that may have been lost when, in 2007, du Plessis signed a Kolpak deal with Lancashire.

His Kolpak deal had expired by then and he was selected in South Africa's one-day squad for the home series against India in January 2011. A half-century on debut sealed his spot for the World Cup that followed. At that point, du Plessis was known as an aggressive ball-striker and quick run-scorer."", ""He was part of the South Africa Test squad that took the Test mace off England in mid-2012, but did not play a game, instead getting a T20 debut on that tour. He got his Test chance on South Africa's tour to Australia later that year and followed his first-innings 78 in the second Test in Adelaide with a stonewalling effort for the ages in the second innings. Du Plessis spent more than seven-and-a-half hours at the crease, faced 376 balls and remained unbeaten on 110 to take South Africa to an unlikely draw, which set them up for a series win in Perth."", 'His curve continued upwards when in December that year, du Plessis was given the T20 captaincy in a series against New Zealand, despite only having played four T20Is prior to that. He was then given the role permanently the following February. Du Plessis had established himself as a complete batsmen, who had the ability to shift gears and anchor an innings, and played a similar knock against India in December 2013. His 134 in the second innings of the Johannesburg Test took South Africa within eight runs of completing the highest successful Test chase, 458, and in the end secured a draw.

His strike rate was below 50 in Tests and close to 30 in one-day internationals. Inevitably, he was over-bowled and the injuries began to accumulate in the twilight of his career. He quit Test cricket after breaking down in the crushing defeat by Australia at Johannesburg in 2001-02,  retired from ODIs a year later, after South Africa's exit from the 2003 World Cup, and from all cricket a year later as his physical deterioration accelerated.

A cricketer with overflowing talent and the temperament to back it up. A fielder able to leap tall buildings and still come up with the catch - and who will happily move behind the stumps into the wicketkeeper's spot if needed. A fine rugby player, golfer, and tennis player. AB de Villiers has emerged as one of South Africa's greats. \n"", ' \nDe Villiers is a 360-degree batsman who can hit any ball, anywhere, against any bowler. Indeed, his range of inventive shots has grown as his career has unfolded. He has been ranked among the top Test and ODI batsmen in the world and has established a cult-like following in T20 cricket, where his performances in the IPL have earned him a legion of Indian fans. ', 'De Villiers made his Test debut against England in 2004 (in the same match as Dale Steyn), when he was picked after just 16 first-class matches. He opened the batting in that match. He was later moved into the middle order and asked to keep wicket. That would become the story of his career. De Villiers has batted everywhere from No.1 to No.8 and performed well in most of those positions. ', ""After a brief slump in form in 2006 and 2007, de Villiers' returned early in 2008 with a blistering 103 not out off 109 balls in Durban against West Indies. Later that year, he became the first South African to score a double-century against India with his undefeated 217 at Ahmedabad. He topped that up with 174 at Leeds in South Africa's first series win in England since readmission and a 106* against Australia in Perth in the country's first series win in Australia post-readmission. That was de Villiers' best Test year, with 1061 runs at 58.94. "", 'He first came close to that again in 2010, when he scored 996 runs in the calendar year. His 278* against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi gave him the highest individual score by a South African in Test cricket (Hashim Amla later scored a triple-century). That same year, de Villiers also struck three successive ODI centuries - two against India and one against West Indies. ', ""The second time he came within touching distance of four figures in a Test calendar year was in 2013 when he scored 933 runs to ensure South Africa kept the Test mace they won in 2012. By then, de Villiers had also accepted the responsibility of full-time Test gloveman after Mark Boucher's retirement, as well as the ODI and T20 captaincy after Graeme Smith stepped down. He later handed over the T20 reigns to Faf du Plessis. "", ""De Villiers blossomed with the additional responsibility, even as concerns over a chronic back injury grew. He was relieved from keeping in shorter formats to concentrate on captaincy when Quinton de Kock was included in South African squad. By 2014, he had also handed the Test keeper's gloves to de Kock. That seemed a sensible decision because Smith retired in March that year and de Villiers was believed to be the natural successor. However, he was overlooked in favour of Amla."", 'That did nothing to dim de Villiers\' resolve. He came back with even more striking power than before and in January 2015 broke the record for the fastest ODI century, reaching it in just 31 balls against West Indies at the Wanderers. That was the loudest warning cry he could have made for South Africa\'s chances at the 2015 World Cup, but it proved a false one. Despite inspirational leadership from de Villiers, who routinely called his team ""the best"" at the tournament, South Africa bowed out at semi-final stage.', ""  \nThe one stage de Villiers did not set alight was international T20 cricket, where he often found himself batting too low in the line-up and with not enough time to make an impact. He rectified that through the IPL, where he was one of the Royal Challengers Bangalore's most successful players. In a memorable match in the 2014 edition of the competition, de Villiers smacked his countryman Steyn for 23 runs in one over. "", '\nWith de Villiers in high demand from foreign leagues, his workload became a talking point in the 2015-16 summer when he suggested he would have to look at ways to lighten the load. There were rumours of early retirement but those were quashed when he was asked to stand in as Test captain when Amla gave up the job mid-series against England. It was a job de Villiers had always wanted and accepted immediately. He was appointed permanent Test captain in January 2016.\n', ' ']","['ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year - 2010, 2014, 2015']",114.0,191.0,18.0,8765.0,278*,50.66,16077.0,54.51,22.0,46.0,1024.0,64.0,222.0,5.0,228.0,218,39,9577.0,176,53.5,9473,101.09,25,53,840,204,176.0,5.0,78.0,75,11,1672.0,79*,26.12,1237,135.16,0,10,140,60,65.0,7.0,141.0,238,23,10689,278*,49.71,19026,56.18,25,60,,,275.0,6.0,263.0,252,44,11123,176,53.47,,,29,63,,,203.0,5.0,275.0,257,51,7405,133*,35.94,4995,148.24,4,48,611,335,188.0,16.0,114.0,5,204,104,2.0,2/49,2/49,52.0,3.05,102.0,0,0,0,228.0,9,192,202,7.0,2/15,2/15,28.85,6.31,27.4,0,0,0,78.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,141.0,,234,138,2,2/49,,69.00,3.53,117.0,0,0,0,263.0,,192,202,7,2/15,2/15,28.85,6.31,27.4,0,0,0,275.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

The leadership mantle was taken away ahead of the 2012 World Cup in Australia in order for him to concentrate on his batting. It paid off as topped South Africa's batting charts with 284 runs from six matches at 47.33 and a best of 126."", ""De Kock was contracted to the Lions in 2012-13 and caught the national selectors' eyes when he starred in a match-winning partnership with Neil McKenzie in the Champions League T20 against Mumbai Indians. He also finished fourth on the first-class rankings, despite playing only six of the 10 matches that summer. "", ""He was selected for South Africa's T20I series against New Zealand in 2012-13 to keep wickets in place of AB de Villiers, who asked to be rested. But he did not make much of a first impression on the international stage. After a lean series in Sri Lanka in July 2013, he was dropped. "", 'De Kock returned in November that year and scored his first ODI century against Pakistan. A month later, he reeled off three in a row against India. Early in 2014, de Kock made his Test debut after Alviro Petersen took ill, but was only given a permanent place later that year, on a tour to Sri Lanka. He scored two half-centuries in his next three Tests, but then tore ankle ligaments during warm-up in a Test against West Indies in December.

However, he struggled to find his old form and struggled through that tournament and a series against Bangladesh. Subsequently, he was dropped again and sent to the South African A side to find his touch.

Since then he's undergone a blond rinse and sorted out his run-up, but the attitude remains. He still wants to bowl fast and sees no point whatsoever in making friends with batsmen. In the long term, Hayward is clearly seen as the successor to Allan Donald as the spearhead of the South African attack. He has genuine pace, the ability to get bounce and abundant energy. When all these are properly harnessed, he can be a fearsome opponent. He toured England with South Africa in 1998, but it was a largely unhappy trip for the fast bowler. He never quite came to terms with English wickets and lost his rhythm and run-up midway through the tour. Question marks surfaced over his willingness to heed advice and for a while it seemed possible that his undoubted potential might go unrealised. However, he started taking wickets left, right and centre and forced his way into the team for the second Test against England. It was an auspicious debut. He took 4 for 75 in conditions, which suited the batsmen and impressed with his willingness to keep running in under a hot sun. However, after 14 Tests, the last of which was against Pakistan in January 2003, it was revealed that he had signed a deal with Worcestershire which precluded him from being released for international matches. At the time, he said he agreed to the contract because he had not been consistently selected in the national squad, and had therefore given up hope of future selection. But after a rethink, he declared himself available again in June 2004, and was immediately picked for the tour of Sri Lanka later that year. He only managed four wickets in two Tests during that tour and faded out of national reckoning. In April 2007 Hayward signed on as one of Ireland's overseas players for the Friends Provident Trophy, and also played for the Kolkata Tigers in the Indian Cricket League at the end of the year.

Which is all the more remarkable considering that Hall took a bullet in his left hand as a mugger let fly six shots at him at an ATM machine late one night in 1998. Miraculously, the bullet lodged in his hand without causing serious damage and Hall recovered sufficiently to win a place in South Africa's one-day side against the West Indies in Durban in 1999. He was initially thought of solely as a limited-overs specialist and was a regular in the ODI side until 2007, taking part in South Africa's 2003 Cricket World Cup squad and the 2007 Cricket World Cup where he took a maiden five-wicket haul against England in Bridgetown. \n"", ""For a while, he appeared to have slipped out of the selectors' minds until Australia arrived in April 2003 for three ODIs. With Herschelle Gibbs struggling for form, Hall was given a match as Gary Kirsten's opening partner. Against the world's fastest bowler, Brett Lee, Hall looked the part, scoring a composed 46 and it was enough to win him a place in the South African squad for Sri Lanka. When Gibbs was then out of the picture because of his involvement in the match-fixing scandal, Hall resumed his partnership with Kirsten and against a Sri Lankan attack which included Muttiah Muralitharan on a turning wicket, he made a most impressive 81."", 'An allrounder who also played indoor cricket for South Africa before breaking into the first-class game, he was not the only talented cricketer in the Hall family, as his father, sister and brother all played for South African representative teams. He was initially seen as a bowler - the livelier side of medium - and batted down the order, but his batting always carried a threat. During the 2003 England tour, he cemented his place with 16 wickets in the series, and ensured South Africa won at Headingley with a buccaneering 99 not out. ', ""Hall was banned for two Tests in 2003 after he was found guilty of breaching two of the ICC's conduct codes during an ODI in Pakistan. He lost out on a place for South Africa's tour to Sri Lanka in 2004, but fought his way back into the side for a series against India. Given the task of opening the innings in a Test in Kanpur in November 2004, he made the most of the opportunity with 163, his maiden hundred. Kent and Worcestershire were the first English counties to show interest in signing him as an overseas player"", ""He was a part of South Africa's nerve-wracking, unforgettable world record win over Australia at Johannesburg in March 2006. During a Test series against Pakistan in 2007, Hall was a constant source of drive for his team-mates, picked up the vital wickets of Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf at Newlands, and looked almost like Test cricket's version of the Supersub - a player who could come in to do many jobs. He earned a spot in South Africa's 15-man World Cup squad, where he took 14 wickets, but was excluded for the ICC World Twenty20 - a decision which prompted him to retire from international cricket in disgust with 21 Tests and 90 limited-overs matches to his name."", 'Northamptonshire swooped a couple of weeks later to secure his services as a Kolpak on a three-year deal, and it turned out to be a length and productive association, not ending until his release after a 2014 season which had brought Northants relegation but with Hall one of only two ever-presents in the Championship side, despite finishing the season at the ripe old age of 39.', 'He took over the Northants captaincy from his fellow South African Nicky Boje midway through the 2010 campaign and narrowly missed out on leading them to promotion to Division One the following summer before standing down after three years in the role.

He also bowled six balls in his ODI career and conceded 17 in one over against Pakistan. ""Misbah-ul-Haq was on strike and I tossed one of my leggies up and he clubbed it for six,"" he said later. ""I turned round and said, \'Let\'s see if you can do it again\' - and he did.""', 'He signed a Kolpak deal with Glamorgan for the 2015 season, combining that with captaincy of the Eastern Cape-based Warriors. Justification was not hard to find: here was a player with 31 ODIs and nine T20Is spaced out between 2010 and 2013, who batted in every position across the top seven. ""I definitely feel I held my own at international level and put in performances,"" he said. ""Unfortunately I ran into a few really good bowlers when I ended up opening, which wasn\'t my preferred position. It was an unsettling period because I did move around, I was in and out of the side and I didn\'t feel backed.""', 'The move to Glamorgan was cathartic.  His menace was obvious in all competitions in 2015, but his 2016 season was inhibited by a knee injury, suffered at the start of the season, which restricted him to white-ball cricket.

He scored 502 runs in the 2016 T20 Blast season, hitting 29 sixes to share the record with Chris Gayle, and also topped Glamorgan's One-Day Cup averages with 367 runs at 61.1. His legspin was another useful weapon: he took a career-best 3 for 20 against Somerset to get Glamorgan into the last eight of the NatWest Blast, but an improvement on that figure as he took 4 for 32 in the quarter-final against Yorkshire in Cardiff could not prevent Glamorgan's elimination."", ""He stood out, too, in 2017.

Then, all those virtues brought him rich rewards after his playing days too, as he became one of the most successful and popular coaches of India. The side went to the top of the Test rankings during his stint, which ended, quite fittingly, with India's World Cup triumph in 2011. \n"", 'As a batsman, what stood out was his determination, the ability to concentrate for long periods and a burning desire to score runs. A left-hander with a relatively unique technique, Kirsten simply worked out his strengths and weaknesses and based his game around them. In this respect he was one of the most organised batsman to play for South Africa since their readmission. Calm and level-headed, he brought a healthy degree of common sense to the art of batting, which possibly explains why off the field and in the dressing room the dafter side of his personality came out. Periodically, Kirsten endured patches when he persistently got out in similar fashion - chopping the ball on to his stumps, for instance, or getting himself caught down the leg side. ', 'Each time this happened, though, Kirsten worked through the problem, made the adjustments and played himself back into form. He enjoyed particular success on the subcontinent - where other players have floundered against the turning ball. Kirsten, though, was drawn on patience and soft hands to see him through. And if there was any player likely to score a big hundred, then it was Kirsten. His best of 275, a result of batting for over 14 and a half hours as South Africa followed on against England at Kingsmead in 1999-00, was the second-longest in Test history. He then returned to haunt England in 2003 and gutsed out a crucial 130 in the Headingley Test, which South Africa won by 191 runs. His good form in that series persuaded him to postpone his retirement until the end of the New Zealand tour in 2003-04. ', ""Fittingly, he scored a century in the first Test of that series - his 99th - and scored a typically gritty 76 in his final game to help South Africa tie the series. After retiring, he spent some time with the Warriors as a consultant batting coach and, in 2006, set up his own academy in Cape Town. In December 2007, he signed up as coach of India, and his quiet and low-profile approach to the job was appreciated by current and past players. After coaching India to No. 1 in Test cricket and World Cup success in 2011, Kirsten moved on to see if he could repeat the magic with his home country. While the global title didn't come, he did firmly establish South Africa as the No. 1 team in Tests. The highlights of his time with them were away series wins against England and then Australia in the latter half of 2012, results which helped South Africa to the top of the rankings. He stood down as South Africa coach in July 2013 and, a couple of months later, was named coach of the IPL franchise Delhi Daredevils."", '\n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2004'],101.0,176.0,15.0,7289.0,275,45.27,16783.0,43.43,21.0,34.0,922.0,12.0,83.0,0.0,185.0,185,19,6798.0,188*,40.95,9436,72.04,13,45,659,20,61.0,1.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,221.0,387,42,16670,275,48.31,,,46,79,,,171,0,294.0,289,27,9586,188*,36.58,,,18,58,,,97.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,101.0,15,349,142,2.0,1/0,1/0,71.0,2.44,174.5,0,0,0,185.0,3,30,23,0.0,-,-,32.91,4.60,-,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,221.0,,1727,836,20,6/68,,41.80,2.90,86.3,,1,0,294.0,,138,112,3,1/25,1/25,37.33,4.86,46.0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

Jacques Kallis is the broad-shouldered colossus of the South African team, a figure whose looming presence inspires calm in some and dread in others.\n \nFew players who belong to the modern age are a better fit for the notion of the classical cricketer. Kallis is a fine, forceful batsman who has at his disposal both a rock-solid technique and a mind impervious to distraction. Though his role as a bowler diminishes with each passing season, he will be remembered as a purveyor of sometimes surprising pace and swing, and awkward bounce. In the slips, his sure-handedness and rattlesnake reflexes make ridiculous catches look regulation. \n', 'Kallis announced himself as a batsman of international stature in his seventh Test, the drawn Boxing Day epic at Melbourne in 1997, when he scored a fighting 101 on a worn last-day pitch. Not even Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne could dislodge him before he had all but saved the match for South Africa.', 'Over the years Kallis has delivered many such innings, performances in which grit is a far more valuable commodity than glitz to a South African team that remains more confident in the field and with its fast bowlers in full cry than as a batting unit. Kallis has willingly shouldered the role of the fulcrum around which the wheel must try to turn. But, occasionally, he has unfurled a stroke of startling aggression that hints at what might have been.', 'Certainly, his lofted drive, which begins with a menacing backlift before uncoiling into the irresistible momentum of a mighty downward swoop of the bat and finishing in a twirl of Baroque, might be described as Mozart in motion. In the lightning flash of that fleeting instant it really does seem as if Kallis could, in the words of one observer, hit a six whenever he felt like it.', ""His critics, particularly those who have a limited understanding of the dynamics of the South African team, accuse him of not dominating attacks he has already ground into the dust, of unnecessarily slow scoring, and of failing to take the match situation into account as he plots his innings. All of which hints at selfishness, which is quite ironical, because his team-mates vouch for the fact that Kallis bats the way he does precisely because he puts his team first and his personal ambitions some way behind.

Langeveldt first came to prominence with his ability to swing the ball at genuine pace, and further work on his action in recent seasons allowed him to generate even more movement, bringing him to the attention of the national selectors. He made his one-day international debut against Kenya in Kimberley in 2001-02, taking two top-order wickets. He followed that with career-best figures of 4 for 21 when the two sides met for a second time at Newlands shortly afterwards. Langeveldt was included in South Africa's 15-man squad for their ill-starred World Cup campaign in 2003, playing only in the pool match against Kenya. He returned to favour when South Africa experienced a dramatic slump in the middle of 2004, taking 3 for 31 in Sri Lanka and then, in perhaps his most impressive spell so far, 3 for 17 against Bangladesh in the ICC Champions Trophy.  \n"", ""He returned in style again against England at Newlands in 2004-05, breaking his hand batting on his return but taking 5 for 46. It was enough to win him selection for the series in the Caribbean which followed. It was in this series that Langeveldt came into his own. In the third one-day match in Barbados, he produced one of the most sensational finales in one-day international history,  plucking a hat-trick out of thin air to steal a one-run victory over West Indies and giving his team a series victory. After a disappointing tour of India and Australia, Langeveldt did not play against Australia at home. He was recalled for the Champions Trophy, however, after some impressive domestic performances. Looked well below par in back-to-back ODI series appearances against India and Pakistan at home, but was included in South Africa's 15-man squad for the World Cup. With memories of his previous success in West Indies, Langeveldt enjoyed a successful tournament with his brand of late reverse swing being particularly effective. He finished as the team's joint leading wicket-taker but will continue to face stiff competition from the array of pace bowling options around him. In March 2008 Langeveldt, absent from the Test side since early 2006, opted out of a three-Test series in India, upset by the controversy surrounding his selection for the tour to India. His inclusion ahead of Andre Nel was seen by many as pandering to Cricket South Africa's transformation policy. In April 2008, he signed a two-year contract with Derbyshire as a Kolpak player and the doubts over his international future increased after this decision.

His next stop was Dale College, a prestigious school where cricket's roots run deep. Dale was not far from Ntini's home village of Mdingi, but it was a place beyond youngsters of his humble station."", ""By the southern summer of 1997-98 season, Ntini was South Africa's first black African international cricketer. But his career seemed over, or at best hanging by a thread, when he was convicted of rape in 1999. He protested his innocence vehemently and consistently and, with the support of the UCB, was acquitted on appeal."", ""Ntini returned to action after almost 20 months in the wilderness, and was a fixture in the national team for the next 10 years. In 2003, he became the first South African to take 10 wickets in a Lord's Test. Five years later he owned the best Test match figures by a South African: Ntini's haul of 13 for 132 against the West Indies under Port-of-Spain's blazing sun and on a not particularly lively Queen's Park Oval pitch was the perfect précis of his career."", 'His 100th Test, against England at Centurion in December 2009, was celebrated with gusto across the country. But it proved to be his last hurrah. Ntini was ineffective, and he was dropped for the last two Tests of the England series. He insisted he would give his all, as he always did, to get back into the side but the team had moved on.

Nel was sent home from the South Africa A tour of Australia in 2003 after being stopped by Tasmanian police and found to be driving under the influence of alcohol. It was the latest in a string of misdemeanors, but not enough to preclude his selection in the South African one-day squad for the tour of England in 2003, for which he was forced to take a temporary break from his contract with Northamptonshire. Nel was tipped from an early age as a future international and he first made the headlines in February 2001 when he felled his hero Allan Donald with a fierce bouncer during a domestic first-class match. Although Nel burst into tears when Donald was forced to leave the field, it later emerged that he was following instructions from coach Ray Jennings to target South Africa's premier fast bowler.  \n"", ""Further controversy followed later that year, when Nel was one of five South African players found guilty of smoking marijuana during the tour of the West Indies. However, it was during the home West Indies series in 2003-04, during which he got married, that he established himself as a permanent member of the Test team - and was only in trouble once, for making facial gestures to Chris Gayle. A back injury curtailed his progress, but he returned with wickets and more facial contortions against England in 2004-05. Nel came into his own during South Africa's tour of Australia at the end of 2005, where he was an intimidating presence with 14 wickets and an attacking mindset. Four dismissals on Boxing Day led to a strong showing at Sydney, and his ability to fight against the backdrop of racial taunts from the Australian crowd was tough. Failed to back his words, however, during a return series at home, finishing with only six wickets, and was involved in a heated argument with Adam Gilchrist in the second Test after being slammed for 22 runs. An unsuccessful tour of Sri Lanka in the summer of 2006 followed, but Nel was retained in South Africa's 14-man squad for the Champions Trophy in India. "", ""Chipped in with wickets and more than a mouthful of words and cheeky grins against India at home, but will probably be remembered most from the Test series for being at the receiving end of a big six and a famous impromptu dance from Indian pace bowler Sreesanth. He secured a place in the 2007 World Cup squad but wasn't a certainty on the final team-sheet. However, his spells against England and Bangladesh showed what he brought to the attack and his commitment was never questioned. With South Africa settling on a young pace-bowling attack, led by Dale Steyn, opportunities were increasingly limited and he announced his international retirement in March, 2009. He has enjoyed spells with Essex in 2005 and 2007, and was granted early leave from the club in 2008 to play for the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. On the domestic front, he transferred from the Titans to the Lions before the 2008-09 season."", ' March 2009']",['Education: Dr EG Jansen (Boksburg)'],36.0,42.0,8.0,337.0,34,9.91,731.0,46.1,0.0,0.0,40.0,5.0,16.0,0.0,79.0,22,12,127.0,30*,12.7,166,76.50,0,0,14,3,21.0,0.0,2.0,1,1,0.0,0*,-,2,0.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,132.0,153,43,1692,96,15.38,,,0,4,,,53,0,219.0,86,44,482,58,11.47,,,0,1,,,49.0,0.0,56.0,28,13,155,19,10.33,113,137.16,0,0,11,8,11.0,0.0,36.0,69,7630,3919,123.0,6/32,10/88,31.86,3.08,62.0,4,3,1,79.0,76,3801,2935,106.0,5/45,5/45,27.68,4.63,35.8,3,1,0,2.0,2,48,42,2.0,2/19,2/19,21.00,5.25,24.0,0,0,0,132.0,,25915,12212,446,6/25,,27.38,2.82,58.1,,14,1,219.0,,10594,7836,302,6/27,6/27,25.94,4.43,35.0,7,4,0,56.0,56,1240,1394,37,2/13,2/13,37.67,6.74,33.5,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

Adept in any position in the batting order, Ontong is a fighting cricketer who can play pace and spin, a committed fielder and a handy spin bowler. \n"", 'Four years after making his first-class debut, Ontong got an opportunity to make his Test debut, in Sydney in January 2002, but the occasion was mired in controversy. Ontong was selected ahead of Jacques Rudolph for political reasons. It emerged that Percy Sonn, then the South Africa board president, had overruled the selectors and insisted on the inclusion of Ontong, a Cape Coloured, ahead of Rudolph, a white player. Rudolph and Ontong were room-mates at the time and have remained friends despite the circumstances of the tour.', ""Scores of nine and 32 were all that Ontong managed in that match and it would be nearly three years before he earned another opportunity in Tests. He eventually returned to the squad for the trip to India in November 2004. However, the return was short-lived as he again failed to establish himself in a strong batting order and he had to wait until early 2008 for another recall when he was named to face West Indies. A strong 2008 domestic season, during which he was the Cobras' leading run-scorer, saw Ontong included for the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 in India in 2009 but he did not play a single game."", 'Ontong returned to the domestic circuit and the fruits of maturity showed. In two first-class seasons in 2010-11 and 2011-12, he averaged over 50 in first-class cricket and in the latter season, over 70 in List A. He became a regular fixture in the South Africa A side and made a fourth return to national colours under the Gary Kirsten administration in January 2012.', ""Ontong was selected for the limited-overs legs of the tour of New Zealand and featured regularly in the twenty-over side since then. He played in the unofficial tri-series in Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh were also participants, and was used in various positions to firm up an experimental middle order. With South Africa's ODI side also searching for the perfect combination, Ontong was one of the players they decided to use in the series against England.

That innings, and a matchwinning 48 in the third Test at Durban, seemed to shed his reputation as a one-day flasher. But by the start of the 2002-03 season, his form had fallen away horribly, and he failed in four consecutive home Tests against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka."", ""However, Prince returned to the side following some good domestic performances, and valuable knocks in the middle order against the West Indies and England at home has seen Prince become a more regular member of the South Africa one-day side. Despite two hundreds in the 2004-05 season - an unbeaten 139 against Zimbabwe at Centurion and 131 in South Africa's 2-0 rout of the West Indies - Prince still does not find himself an automatic selection in the longer format of the game. Long rated highly by SA's cricket supremo Ali Bacher, Prince is strong through the off side, and was Western Province's player of the year in 2001. His throwing from the deep has been hampered by a long-term shoulder injury, but he remains a brilliant shot-stopping fielder in the covers. The highlight of his career was a fine 119 in the third Test against Australia at Sydney in early 2006, but it was during this series that he became bunny to a legend: Shane Warne. Warne dismissed him in the first five innings - though Prince played the rest of the bowlers admirably - and troubled him plentiful when South Africa hosted Australia in March. Scores of 17, 27, 33 and 7 overshadowed a fantastic 93 in the first innings at Johannesburg."", ""In July 2006 he was named as South Africa's first non-white captain in the absence of the injured Graeme Smith. The result was a disappointing 2-0 whitewash at the hands of Sri Lanka. Prince made way for Mark Boucher to captain in the tri-series, also featuring India, which was ultimately aborted following South Africa's withdrawal over security concerns. Prince was not included in South Africa's squad for the Champions Trophy, but continued his sterling 2006 Test form against India at home. The highest run-scorer on either side in the three-Test contest, Prince's series highlights included an outstanding 97 in a loss at Johannesburg and a third career hundred at Cape Town."", ""When Pakistan toured next, Prince was the only centurion in the three-Test series. His 138 laid the foundations for victory in the first Test at Centurion Park, and his numbers can't be argued with, as he ended the season's six Tests averaging 60.67. It was enough to earn him a recall to the one-day side, including a ticket to the West Indies for the World Cup, but it was a disappointing tournament and he was again omitted for the short tour of Ireland. He enjoyed a reasonable summer against West Indies, however, with 263 runs in the three Tests, and began the subsequent tour of England in scintillating form, with a crucial momentum-shifting century at Lord's, and a brilliant matchwinning 149 at Headingley."", ""Just as it seemed Prince's career was heading in exactly the right direction, he was derailed. He broke his thumb ahead of the 2008-9 series against Australia and lost his place to JP Duminy, who won the series with a sterling undefeated 166 in Melbourne. Although Prince was promised his role back, he did not get it and was only recalled for the return series against Australia at home, when an injury ruled Smith out again. "", 'Prince was asked to captain and open the batting but refused the former if he could not choose his position in the line-up. Jaques Kallis led the side and Prince opened and scored a defiant 150 to announce his return. That was the last of his 11 centuries. ', ""He was moved back to South Africa's middle-order after Duminy lost form and played in 18 more Tests with a top score of 78* and three half-centuries. He was under pressure when South Africa to Sri Lanka for the first time at home in Durban in 2013. Prince was among the low scorers and ran out his partner Hashim Amla. he was dropped for the New Year's Test. "", ""He continued for his local franchise, the Warriors and for Lancashire. He intended to retire from all cricket in 2014 but stayed on to play one more season with Lancashire, where he remained highly productive, and then retired in September 2015 after being named on South Africa's selection panel.

Dad Peter led the South African attack through the 1960s; uncle Graeme was one of the finest, if not the finest, left-hander to play the game. Shaun has bits of both in his makeup, but it is as an immaculate, Hadlee-esque, line and length seamer that he has established himself. At the start of his first-class career, though, he was both slippery and aggressive and his Natal team-mates delighted in totting up the number of batsmen he pinned match after match. He was brought into the South African Test side against Michael Atherton's England tourists in 1995/96 and although his father was the convener of selectors, there was never a hint of nepotism and the younger Pollock took quickly to the higher level.  \n"", ""In 1996 he had a spell with Warwickshire cut short because of an ankle injury and missed the tour to India at the end of that year. But he soon returned to resume his new-ball partnership with Allan Donald and this pairing was the springboard of much of South Africa's success during the latter half of the 1990s. Indeed, it is possible to argue that the emergence of Pollock inspired Donald to greater heights as the latter found himself with a partner who both complemented and challenged him. Perhaps the straightest bowler in world cricket, Pollock is able to move the ball both ways at a lively pace. He also possesses stamina and courage in abundance as in proved in Adelaide in 1998 when he toiled on hour after hour in blazing heat to take 7 for 87 in 41 overs on a perfect batting pitch. "", ""If there is a criticism of Pollock, it is that he has underperformed with the bat, but most Test teams would be perfectly happy to have him in their side if he never scored a run. Pollock was thrust into the captaincy in April 2000 when Hansie Cronje was drummed out of the game, and he faced the biggest challenge of his career - to lift a shocked and demoralised South African side. However, after a solid start to his captaincy, he lost some credibility after a 3-0 drubbing in Australia in 2001-02, and was later blamed for South Africa's disastrous World Cup in which they failed to qualify for the Super Sixes. As a result, Pollock immediately lost the captaincy and was replaced by Graeme Smith. \nThough his nagging brilliance around offstump remains, his pace and ability to take wickets at the top of the order has dipped. "", ""Pollock missed the first Test against Australia at home in early 2006 with a back injury and was relegated from opener to first-change by the third. Four wickets in two Tests, with a new run-up and on pitches tailormade for his style, showed that he has slowed. But with 100 Tests under his belt, Pollock remains an integral part of the side. He missed the first Test against Sri Lanka due to the birth of his second daughter, returned for the second and was a pale shade of his former self. He managed just one wicket, and it was a telling sign of what appeared to be Pollock's decline to see him resort to offspin after being tonked over his head for six by Sanath Jayasuriya. All that was reversed in the Champions Trophy in India, where he showed great form, and against India and Pakistan at home at the end of 2006 and in the new year. Man of the Series in both the ODIs and Tests against India, Pollock was highly impressive with the new ball and chipped in with useful scores down the order. It was fitting that he became the first South African to take 400 Test wickets. Pollock continued his fine form against the touring Pakistanis next, despite being surprisingly rested for the final Test. Thrifty with the ball and useful with bat he offered precious control and breathing space for his captain. In the ODI series, he was the highest wicket-taker on either side and his 5 for 23 in the final game crushed a weary Pakistan. For the second consecutive one-day series in a row, Pollock was adjudged Man of the Series. It was decent form to carry into his fourth World Cup, but his lack of pace was exposed on the small Caribbean grounds, especially by Matthew Hayden, although his miserly spell against England was key in South Africa securing a semi-final berth. He lost his place in the Test line-up late in 2007 but returned against West Indies, on his home ground in Durban, for what turned out to be his final Test.

Philander hails from a country famous for producing high-quality fast bowlers, and he has done everything in his first few games to keep up that tradition. His strength isn't extreme pace, but he has everything else going for him: the ability to move the ball both ways at a sharp speed, and relentlessly attack the stumps over long spells.  \n"", ""His promotion to the Test squad was the result of consistent performances in the domestic circuit - he got a chance to play the home series against Australia in 2011 after taking 35 wickets at an average of 16.11 in the 2010-11 domestic season - but even he wouldn't have anticipated the immediate impact he made. He started with a Man-of-the-Match performance in his first Test, taking 8 for 78, including a second-innings haul of 5 for 15, to help South Africa to a stunning win in Cape Town. He followed it up with another five-for in the second Test, winning him the Man-of-the-Series prize. The good times continued in his next two series as well, as he grabbed 16 in two Tests against Sri Lanka and then tormented New Zealand in the three Test away series. He thus had six five-fors in his first seven Tests, and reached 50 wickets only 139 days from his debut. "", ""Before all that Test success, Philander performed consistently for Cape Cobras. He also played for South Africa Under-19s on their tour of England in 2003 and the U-19 World Cup in Bangladesh. In 2006-07 he produced an impressive one-day season for the Cobras, averaging 72 with the bat and 30 with the ball. It was enough to earn him a place in South Africa's squad for their one-day tour of Ireland, a team he'd been lined up to play for before a stress fracture of his back, and he was rewarded for a good display there with a spot in the Twenty20 World Championships in 2007. \n"", ' ', ' \n']",[],58.0,82.0,18.0,1538.0,74,24.03,3338.0,46.07,0.0,8.0,174.0,15.0,17.0,0.0,30.0,19,7,151.0,30*,12.58,213,70.89,0,0,14,0,6.0,0.0,7.0,4,0,14.0,6,3.50,28,50.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,161.0,221,43,4679,168,26.28,9828,47.60,3,17,,,41,0,128.0,88,29,1382,79*,23.42,1827,75.64,0,5,,,12.0,0.0,108.0,75,37,971,56*,25.55,721,134.67,0,1,53,41,22.0,0.0,58.0,109,10420,4632,214.0,6/21,10/102,21.64,2.66,48.6,7,13,2,30.0,28,1279,986,41.0,4/12,4/12,24.04,4.62,31.1,2,0,0,7.0,6,83,114,4.0,2/23,2/23,28.50,8.24,20.7,0,0,0,161.0,,27981,12242,569,7/61,,21.51,2.62,49.1,31,24,2,128.0,,5365,4172,127,4/12,4/12,32.85,4.66,42.2,3,0,0,108.0,100,1903,2522,81,5/17,5/17,31.13,7.95,23.4,1,1,0,False,False,False,False

Peterson, a left-arm finger spinner from Eastern Province, fills all three vacancies more than competently. At first glance he seems an overly orthodox slow bowler, but he turns the ball appreciably given help from the pitch and is invariably a tidy operator with a steadily developing understanding of flight. Peterson has also cultivated an unusual delivery that turns into the right-handed batsmen.He was part of the South African Under-19 team that took on Pakistan and England, and he played the Under-19 World Cup in 1998. Peterson made his Test debut in 2003 against Bangladesh, taking five wickets and scored 61. It was in Bangladesh where he took his first five-wicket haul as well, on the 2008 tour. \n', ""Given more chances in ODIs, Peterson eventually began to grab his opportunities and his bowling, in particular, developed very usefully. He was part of South Africa's squad at the 2007 World Cup and hit the winning boundary - an outside edge past slip - in South Africa's one-wicket victory over Sri Lanka at Providence. He slipped out of national contention for a time, and didn't play for South Africa again for two years, but in the meantime represented the Warriors with distinction. In April 2009 he moved to Cape Town and, despite having a year remaining on his Warriors contract, requested a transfer to the Cape Cobras because his partner wanted to pursue her career in the Western Cape. "", ""Peterson feared that he was simply treading water, however, and came close to relinquishing his dreams of further honours with South Africa. He made himself unavailable for national selection and headed to Derbyshire as a Kolpak player. Nevertheless, he was named in South Africa's squad for the 2011 World Cup, and though his inclusion was initally greeted by scepticism in some quarters, Peterson proved the doubters wrong with some superb all-round performances. He finished as South Africa's leading wicket-taker in the tournament, and particular highlights included his match-winning innings in the thrilling victory over India and his three-wicket opening burst against England.

Extreme pace, the ability to swing the ball both ways, and accuracy have perhaps made him the country's best ever. At the peak of his powers, Steyn possessed a lithe and wiry body, a steaming run-up that culminated in a aerodynamic action, and a ripper of an outswinger. \n"", ""Steyn grew up in Phalaborwa, in the country's northern-most province, and spent his childhood obsessed with skateboarding. It was only when he moved to a bigger city, Pretoria, that he gave cricket a proper go and it did not take long before he was considered a serious prospect. He played just seven first-class matches before he was selected for South Africa and made his debut against England in 2004, in the same match as AB de Villiers. "", 'He did not have an immediate impact and spent the following winter playing for Essex in Division 2 of the county championship, and the 2005-06 season honing his craft in the domestic set-up before he was recalled, a visibly fiercer bowler. Steyn took 16 wickets in his second series, against New Zealand, but it was only when he faced them the next year, in the 2007-08 summer, that he announced himself as one of the fierce fast men. ', 'A visibly fired-up Steyn took ten wickets in the first Test in Johannesburg. Then, shortly after lunch on the first day of the second Test in Centurion, he delivered a short ball to Craig Cumming, who missed. The ball crashed into his face and sent him to intensive care. ', 'The flow of wickets became a gush, and in 2008, he became the fastest South African at the time, and the 15th fastest overall, to reach 100 Test wickets. That September, Steyn was named ICC Test Player of the Year after taking 86 wickets in 14 matches at an average of 18.10. ', 'He was part of the South African side that beat England and Australia for the first time away from home since readmission, and then proved he could do it on the subcontinent. In 2010, Steyn summoned reverse-swing reminiscent of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis and took 7 for 51 as South Africa beat India in Nagpur. ', 'He went on to win the Test championship with the team in England in 2012 and took his 300th Test wicket the following year, against New Zealand. He was only the fourth South African to rack up that many scalps. ', ""After he turned 30, Steyn's injury-free run ended. He suffered a groin strain in the Champions Trophy in June 2013, a side strain later that year and a rib fracture in early 2014, a year in which he had three hamstrings strains but also played a part in South Africa's first Test series win in Sri Lanka in over two decades."", ""He led South Africa's attack at the 2015 World Cup but also became the face of their failed campaign. He delivered the final over in the semi-final against New Zealand and was hit for six by Grant Elliott off the penultimate ball."", ""Steyn did not seem to be the same afterwards. In November 2015, he suffered a groin strain during the first Test against India in Mohali and missed the rest of the four-match series. He returned in December to play against England but a shoulder injury cut short that summer. In the 2015-16 season, Steyn missed six of South Africa's eight Tests and all their ODIs.

His debut came a year after his selection for the New Year's Test in Australia in January 2002 was vetoed by United Cricket Board president Percy Sonn who demanded that Justin Ontong, a player of colour, debut instead. "", ""\nWhen given his chance, Rudolph's response was a statement of strength. His double-century in Chittagong was also part of a record-breaking, unbeaten 429-run stand for the third wicket with Boeta Dippenaar. The partnership was the first 400-plus stand for South Africa in Test cricket. "", '\nRudolph scored four more centuries, including an unbeaten 102 to save South Africa from defeat in a classic at Perth at the end of 2005, but then managed just one fifty in his next 14 innings and was dropped after a tour to Sri Lanka in 2006. In January 2007, he decided to move to Yorkshire on a three-year Kolpak deal, suspending his international career with South Africa in the hope of redeveloping his game.', '\nHe made 1078 runs at 56.73 in his first County Championship season and immediately extended his contract to the end of 2011. In each of the next three seasons he made over 1000 first-class runs and it rekindled his appetite for the highest level. ', ""\nHe left his Yorkshire deal a year early to re-stake a claim for South Africa with his old franchise, Titans. Rudolph's first season back in South Africa, in 2010-11, was a huge success. He was the leading run-scorer in the SuperSport series, with 954 runs in 17 innings, and was rewarded with a call-up to the national squad to face Australia in late 2011 and partner Graeme Smith at the top of the order. "", ""\nRudolph struggled to carry his domestic form to the international stage and after eight innings was moved down into the middle order. He fared better there, and scored the only century of his second stint, which spanned 13 Tests. He was part of the squad that won the Test mace off England in mid-2012 but was dropped during South Africa's next series in Australia, later that year. "", '\nHe continued playing for Titans until the 2014-15 season, after which he chose to focus on county cricket and T20 leagues. In 2013, he signed a two-year deal at Glamorgan. In 2014,  he made 857 Championship runs which also led to a two-year extension at the end of that year.

Rhodes worked harder than anyone else in a team of hard workers, frequently delaying the team bus at the end of practice for one more round of reflex catches hit from ten metres or less. Nobody has ever fielded better in the key one-day position of backward point, where he leapt like a salmon, threw off balance, and stopped singles by reputation alone. He laboured just as hard over his batting which needed, and underwent, a complete technical overhaul in 1997 - whereupon he averaged 50 for the rest of his Test career, until he gave it up to concentrate on one-day cricket in 2000. The problem was a tendency to bring the bat down from gully and through to midwicket, a legacy of the extraordinary hockey skills that brought him selection for the Olympic Games in 1996 - an offer he had to refuse. Few batsmen have turned the quick single into a finer art form, and his willingness to experiment and adapt enabled him to lead the way with the reverse-sweep under Bob Woolmer's tutelage. But Rhodes was just as likely to delay the bus by relentlessly signing autographs for gaggles of persistent children; the arrival of his own, a daughter, was instrumental in his semi-retirement. Indeed, Rhodes may have become the first cricketer to claim paternity leave. Rightly, there is give and take in Rhodes's life. He has more endorsements than any team-sport player in South Africa's history, is at the forefront of the sporting dotcom revolution, and is constantly exploring the boundaries and horizons of commerce. His final retirement was hastened by an inopportune finger-fracture early in the 2003 World Cup, although there was still time for a successful farewell season in county cricket for Gloucestershire.\n"", ' \n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1999'],52.0,80.0,9.0,2532.0,117,35.66,5467.0,46.31,3.0,17.0,256.0,22.0,34.0,0.0,245.0,220,51,5935.0,121,35.11,7336,80.90,2,33,392,47,105.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,164.0,263,31,9546,172,41.14,,,22,52,,,127,0,371.0,339,68,8907,121,32.86,,,2,51,,,158.0,0.0,6.0,5,0,49,42,9.80,52,94.23,0,0,3,1,1.0,0.0,52.0,2,12,5,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.50,-,0,0,0,245.0,2,14,4,0.0,-,-,32.91,1.71,-,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,164.0,,162,83,1,1/13,,83.00,3.07,162.0,,0,0,371.0,,80,45,2,1/2,1/2,22.50,3.37,40.0,0,0,0,6.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

His early century drought might suggest otherwise, but he is a man for long innings, a man who seems to love to bat on and on. His first century arrived in Bangladesh, in his tenth Test, and he made it a big one, falling five short of a double. He scored two more in the series in India immediately after.

Unfortunately for West Indies, they haven't been able to utilise his services as often as they probably would have liked to: till the end of 2013, more than nine years since his Test debut, he had played only 40 out of West Indies' 81 Tests in the same period. Prioritising IPL over international cricket has led to differences with the board, while injuries have also limited his Test appearances, but as a limited-overs player Bravo remains a key member for West Indies and took over from Darren Sammy as ODI captain in 2013. He held the post till December 2014, when the selectors replaced him with Jason Holder and left him out of the ODI side, two months after he had played a central role in the team pulling out mid-way from a tour to India due to issues with the payment structure in their revised contracts.  \n"", ""As a player, Bravo's skills and self-confidence at the big stage were never in doubt right from the early days in his international career. He made his Test debut at Lord's in July 2004, and took three wickets in the first innings with his medium-paced swingers. He also showed a cool enough temperament to forge a confident start at the crease with the bat. By the end of the series, it was clear that Bravo was a special talent. He scored plenty of runs and claimed a bunch of wickets in four Tests, but nowhere was his ability more evident than in Manchester, where he top-scored for the team, and then restricted England with a six-wicket haul. He hit 107 against South Africa in April 2004-05 at Antigua to bring up his maiden century and in November 2005, scored a magnificent 113 against Australia at Hobart. He dazzled in the ODI series against India in May 2006, bamboozling the batsmen with his slower ones and chipping in with match-winning contributions with the bat. He grew as a player in the limited-overs format in the 2006-07 season with a fluent unbeaten 112, his maiden ODI ton, against England in the Champions Trophy and achieved his best career figures, 4 for 39, against India in the last game before the World Cup. He was often a rare glimmer of joy among some depressing moments until an ankle injury struck in 2008 and ruled him out for eight months. "", ""Around that time, his value as a Twenty20 player came into focus, and with several such leagues coming - most prominently the IPL - Bravo chose those commitments over the West Indians ones. In 2010, he, along with Kieron Pollard, turned down a WICB central contract which would require him to be available to play for West Indies at all times.

His height gives him a curious aspect akin to a windmill when he delivers, but it also makes facing him on a dry track a daunting prospect. He has been economical without being spectacular for West Indies in one-day cricket, but registered remarkable figures of 4 for 6 in a Twenty20 against Zimbabwe in early 2010 - a match that, however, West Indies went on to lose. He picked up eight wickets in the first Test against England at Sabina Park in February 2009 to help set up what was ultimately a Test series win - although his efforts were forgotten amid Jerome Taylor's destruction of England's top order.

His sprint to the crease is reminiscent of Malcolm Marshall's, but, unlike Marshall, his open-chested deliveries seem to limit his ability to move the ball away from the right-hander. His misfortune has been the plague of modern fast bowlers: stress fractures. Yet he is a determined man, who recovered from back injuries when critics had written him off at the end of West Indies' tour of England in 2000, and thus fulfilled his promise to be back in the game. He took four wickets on his return to the one-day side in Zimbabwe in 2001, as West Indies beat India in the final of the Coca-Cola Cup, and after a moderately successful World Cup in 2003, he was recalled to the Test team for the home series against Sri Lanka.

Against India at home in 2006, however, Collymore pegged away all through the series, providing a valuable tourniquet at one end. He was way ahead of the other fast bowlers in terms of his economy-rate (2.33) and always appeared capable of taking a wicket. His spell on the first morning at Antigua floored India and, despite not looking fully fit, maintained his accuracy throughout. He played only eight international games in the 2006-07 season and averaged over 30 but just ahead of the selection for World Cup he rocked Jamaica with a six-for in the Carib series. He failed to carry that form into the tournament itself but still found himself briefly in the top 10 of the ICC Test rankings.

Collins was a keen footballer before he fell into cricket, and his left-arm bowling follows the lineage of Bernard Julien and Garry Sobers, and he finds enough swing into the right-hander to cause the best batsmen difficulty. In November 1998 he took three wickets in 11 balls for West Indies A against India, a spell which led to his Test debut against Australia the following March. For a long time after that, he was best remembered for an injury of the cruellest kind, when a Jason Gillespie delivery trapped a testicle outside his box. He worked on his fitness, though, and he returned to the side in 2001-02, with a higher arm action and an extra yard of pace. He took just nine wickets in West Indies' series victory over India, but claimed the prize scalp of Sachin Tendulkar on three occasions. He struggled on India's flat pitches, though, before terrorising Bangladesh in 2002-03. What followed was a less-than-enchanting outing against Australia, and Collins didn't play for close to a year. But he returned to take on England in March 2004, and within six balls, removed Michael Vaughan, before taking three more wickets, to herald a successful return to the side. After a spell out of the side which saw him miss the World Cup and the 2007 tour of England, he was recalled to the West Indies squad for the Twenty20 World Championship and soon after he signed a two-year deal with Surrey as a Kolpak player.

With a couple of other senior batsmen, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chris Gayle, not being available due to various reasons, Chanderpaul's contributions were immense, as he has defied bowling attacks in all countries and all conditions, often with minimal support from the other end. One of the best examples of that was against Australia in 2012, in the series in which he got to 10,000 Test runs: he ran up scores of 103*, 12, 94, 68 and 69, for an aggregate of 346 in five innings.

There are many similarities between Chanderpaul and Deonarine, both having come through the cricket system in Guyana, from the sharp fielding at cover-point to the anti-glare patches under his eyes. His offspin showed promise - in the Carl Hooper mould - but his stay at the top was brief once the big-guns returned. He fell out of favour for almost two years, until he was called up to West Indies' Twenty20 squad for the inaugural World Championship in September 2007, but didn't make the final squad.

He was part of West Indies' 1983 World Cup squad, hitting the headlines when he took a record 7 for 51 against Australia at Headingley, but he suffered on the docile Indian pitches the following winter.  He was called into the touring West Indies squad as injury cover from Glamorgan (where he had been since 1982) and did enough to gain selection for the tour to Australia where, again, he struggled with eight wickets at 52.  In two home Tests against New Zealand he took ten wickets, including his Test-best 4 for 19 at Kingston.  He returned for his second tour to India where he took 13 wickets at 30 each, but thereafter slipped out of the reckoning as many fast-bowling rivals emerged.

Spotted in the nets by Brian Lara, he was called up for his Test debut after just one match for Barbados, and promptly took five wickets against Sri Lanka in Jamaica in June 2003. He added five in his first overseas Test, and six in his first one-day international. With a round-arm action not unlike Jeff Thomson's, which has left him vulnerable to back strains, he was more of a protégé of his neighbour Corey Collymore than his half-brother Pedro Collins. He bowls fast, can swing the ball and get reverse swing, but insists that he does not go for out-and-out pace.  \n"", ""Despite regular chances at Test level, however, he rarely showed enough control to be a match-winner and the selectors blew as hot and cold as did his bowling.  They did draft him into the squad to tour England in 2007. He bowled well in the Chester-le-Street Test but was fined for swearing too loudly, and an unproductive series in South Africa followed. He lost his spot for the first Test against Sri Lanka, was recalled in Trinidad and grabbed five wickets to help West Indies draw the series. At one-day level he was given a long run in 2006 but axed towards the end of the year after failing to shine at the Champions Trophy. Edwards was not needed at the World Cup but, on his ODI recall, he blasted through England with 5 for 45 at Lord's."", ""He reached a personal milestone in the second Test against New Zealand at Napier on West Indies' 2008-09 tour, taking 7 for 87 - his career-best figures - to pass 100 Test dismissals. Settling into the role of senior bowler in the West Indies side, he bowled aggressively without much reward on England's tour of West Indies in early 2009, and was particularly venomous towards Kevin Pietersen and James Anderson. But arguably his most important performances in the series came with the bat, as he and Daren Powell clung on for 60 balls to secure a draw in the third Test in Antigua. Edwards was at it again in the fifth Test in Trinidad, surviving a tense finale to secure the Wisden Trophy for the first time since 2000."", ""But just as Edwards began to find the consistency that had long eluded him, he picked up another back injury in the course of West Indies' campaign at the World Twenty20 in England in June 2009. He returned to Barbados and was put on a remedial programme, but abandoned it to represent Deccan Chargers in the Champions League later that year. He picked up another injury in the course of that tournament, and was ruled out of West Indies' tour of Australia - perhaps a relief as the depleted side failed to win a single game. The last of his 55 Tests came against Bangladesh in Khulna in 2012."", 'Hampshire benefited from his presence in 2015. By picking up 45 Championship wickets at 20.8 from eight matches, he was the prime force in their First Division survival, taking 10 wickets in a first-class match for only the second in his career as Hampshire crucially beat Nottinghamshire in the last match to avoid relegation. A broken ankle suffered in a pre-match warm-up at Headingley wrecked his 2016 season as Hampshire only escaped relegation because Durham were demoted after a financial bale-out, but a useful season a year later again helped Hampshire escape on the final day.

But a lack of respect, for opposition bowlers at least, has served Gayle well since then. Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers. And in this era of Twenty20 cricket, Gayle is the batsman who has thrived like no other. \n', ""Among his many strengths, perhaps the biggest one is his outstanding hand-eye coordination, which allows Gayle to regularly hit even good-length deliveries for boundaries. Technique and footwork aren't his greatest assets, but most often he compensates with other skills. No batsman has taken to the 20-over format like he has. He showed early signs of his liking for that format by smashing the first century in Twenty20 internationals - a 57-ball 117 against South Africa in the World Twenty20 in 2007 - and when Twenty20 leagues mushroomed the world over and sought international stars, Gayle was the biggest beneficiary. "", 'Over two seasons - 2011 and 2012 - of the IPL, he became easily the most feared batsman of the league, smashing more hundreds and sixes than any other batsman, by far. When he carted Pune Warriors all over the ground to score an unbeaten 175 in IPL 2013, it felt right that he should finally own the record for highest individual score, fastest century, and most sixes in a Twenty20 innings, because no batsman has dominated Twenty20 cricket like he has. ', ""Gayle's free-stroking, aggressive style is obviously best suited for limited-overs cricket, but that doesn't mean he hasn't cut it as a Test batsman. When he has turned up for West Indies, his pugnacious approach has become an attacking weapon in its own right, in what's been a lean era for West Indian cricket. His 79-ball century at Cape Town in January 2004, on the back of a South African first innings of 532, was typical of his no-holds-barred approach. However, Gayle has also shown the ability to bat long periods and the hunger to make big scores. In 2009 against Australia, Gayle batted almost seven-and-a-half hours in scoring an unbeaten 165 to save the Test in Adelaide; in the very next game, though, he smashed the fifth-fastest Test century - off 70 balls - to indicate that quick-scoring remained his preferred method. Next year he batted almost ten hours and scored 333 against Sri Lanka and Muralitharan in Galle, becoming only the fourth batsman to score two triples in Tests, thus proving again his ability to bat long periods."", ""And then there is also his brisk non-turning offspin, with which he has turned himself into a genuine allrounder in limited-overs cricket. His tendency to stay aloof on the field sometimes suggests he isn't interested in the proceedings, but his relaxed approached was good for the team whenever he led West Indies. However, West Indies have missed his services far too often due his differences with their board. During his exile, he was a Twenty20 regular in various leagues around the world, entertaining crowds in Australia, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. After a long spell out from international cricket he returned strongly in 2012 on the tour of England and subsequently at home against New Zealand.""]",[],103.0,182,11,7214.0,333,42.18,11970,60.26,15,37,1046,98,96.0,0.0,289.0,283,17,10151.0,215,38.16,11649,87.14,25,51,1093,314,120.0,0.0,58.0,54,4,1627.0,117,32.54,1139,142.84,2,13,138,105,15.0,0.0,180.0,321,26,13226,333,44.83,,,32,64,,,158.0,0.0,361.0,354,24,12860,215,38.96,,,29,67,,,150.0,0.0,371.0,363,47,12318,175*,38.98,8374,147.09,21,76,942,907,87.0,0.0,103.0,104,7109,3120,73.0,5/34,6/81,42.73,2.63,97.3,2,2,0,289.0,195,7334,5846,165.0,5/46,5/46,35.43,4.78,44.4,3,1,0,58.0,23,319,377,17.0,2/15,2/15,22.17,7.09,18.7,0,0,0,180.0,,12511,5194,132,5/34,,39.34,2.49,94.7,,2,0,361.0,,9610,7300,227,5/46,5/46,32.15,4.55,42.3,4,1,0,371.0,131,1945,2479,80,4/22,4/22,30.98,7.64,24.3,2,0,0,False,True,False,True

It wasn't until his fourth coming as an international cricketer that he really made his mark, with back-to-back centuries against the mighty Australians. All of a sudden, his phlegmatic approach became a vital counterpoint to a rejunevated Brian Lara at the other end. But his form fell away and he was dropped after the first Test against South Africa in April 2004-05. Recalled for the 2005-06 tour to New Zealand, he was the second highest run scorer in the three-Test fixture. He looked good for a third hundred - and West Indies for a rare victory - in the first Test at Auckland, but a rash stroke on 95 ruined all that and Ganga was in for flack from his critics. Indifferent innings at Wellington and Napier notwithstanding, he was retained for the series against India later that season. It proved to be a benchmark of sorts, and Ganga clearly had taken a mature step forward. His total of 344 runs in four Tests was a team high by some margin, and his 135 and unbeaten 66 in the drawn third Test in St Kitts were innings of confidence and composure.  He cemented his place with back-to-back 80s in Pakistan. Touring England as the vice-captain, Ganga's position was soon elevated following Ramnaresh Sarwan's injury. Ganga, however, failed to shine with the bat and was dropped for the Natwest Series that followed. Even after being named as Trinidad & Tobago's cricketer of the year, Ganga failed to find a place in the squad for the ICC World Twenty20 and the tour of Zimbabwe before making a return to the squad for the the tour of South Africa that followed. However he had six poor innings in South Africa and was not picked by the selectors for the rest of 2008 and the majority of 2009. He continued to lead Trinidad and Tobago, and their victory in the Stanford 20/20 won them a berth in the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 in India, where Ganga's stock went up when he guided his team to the final.\n"", ' October 2009\n \n']",[],48.0,86,2,2160.0,135,25.71,5556,38.87,3,9,284,2,30.0,0.0,35.0,34,1,843.0,71,25.54,1414,59.61,0,9,69,7,11.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,26.0,26,26.00,31,83.87,0,0,3,1,0.0,0.0,172.0,302,29,10137,265,37.13,,,23,48,,,112.0,0.0,109.0,108,13,2810,101*,29.57,,,2,20,,,36.0,0.0,40.0,31,5,518,62*,19.92,476,108.82,0,1,27,19,14.0,0.0,48.0,8,186,106,1.0,1/20,1/20,106.0,3.41,186.0,0,0,0,35.0,1,1,4,0.0,-,-,32.91,24.00,-,0,0,0,1.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,172.0,,622,334,4,1/7,,83.50,3.22,155.5,,0,0,109.0,,301,193,5,2/20,2/20,38.60,3.84,60.2,0,0,0,40.0,1,6,18,0,-,-,-,18.00,-,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

His scores of 165 and 52 included 33 boundaries. A fallow period followed, thanks partly to some harsh umpiring decisions in England, but the real problem was that lazy front foot. As opposition coaches caught on, edged drives and leg-befores abounded. It was a surprise, then, when Hinds was promoted to open for the last Test of West Indies' 2000-01 Australian tour, and all the more so when he and Sherwin Campbell shared opening stands of 147 and 98. Then Chris Gayle happened, and that, along with the team's tendency to chop and change after each series, Hinds was dropped. But after West Indies tried three different opening combinations during the one-day series in England in 2004, he was recalled for his experience and the stability the team required during the Champions Trophy. He failed with the bat, but his bowling was effective in the semi-final and final, when wickets were needed most. He was dropped after another poor showing in the tour of New Zealand in March 2006 but returned in May for the ODI series against India at home. He still struggled to nail down a permanent place and disappeared from the scene again after the Champions Trophy. He signed a Kolpak deal with Derbyshire for 2008 meaning his international future is in doubt.\n"", ' \n']",[],45.0,80,1,2608.0,213,33.01,5459,47.77,5,14,368,16,32.0,0.0,119.0,111,10,2880.0,127*,28.51,4393,65.55,5,14,261,50,29.0,0.0,5.0,5,1,30.0,14,7.50,41,73.17,0,0,3,0,1.0,0.0,175.0,295,17,10110,213,36.36,,,23,51,,,80.0,0.0,211.0,198,15,5093,127*,27.83,,,6,28,,,47.0,0.0,46.0,41,9,940,72*,29.37,881,106.69,0,4,70,23,6.0,0.0,45.0,25,1123,590,16.0,3/79,5/134,36.87,3.15,70.1,0,0,0,119.0,34,945,837,28.0,3/24,3/24,29.89,5.31,33.7,0,0,0,5.0,-,-,-,0.0,-,-,-,7.05,-,-,-,-,175.0,,3967,1872,50,3/9,,37.44,2.83,79.3,,0,0,211.0,,1508,1353,49,4/35,4/35,27.61,5.38,30.7,1,0,0,46.0,13,145,183,4,2/14,2/14,45.75,7.57,36.2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False

But in the pavilion there hangs a portrait of Roger Harper, who learned his trade there as one of the game's finest. Graham Gooch remembers him all too well. Batting for MCC against the World XI in the festival MCC Bicentenary match at Lord's in 1987, Gooch had passed 100 when  he drilled Harper's offspin just to the on side of straight and took some anticipatory paces down the pitch. It was not a clever move. Harper took one stride to his right, his right arm telescoped and plucked the ball cleanly from the turf. In the same flowing movement he threw down Gooch's middle stump with the batsman upended on all fours. Harper was not a great offspinner - he suffered in later years from the yips - and little more than an adequate hard-hitting batsman. But his fielding was fabulous. After retirement he went into coaching, taking charge of West Indies between 2000 and 2003 during a period of transition.  He was appointed as the U-19 coach in December 2005, but quit after a month to take charge of the Kenyan national side where he rebuilt a squad that was close to a shambles when he arrived.

A wicketkeeper and left-hand bat, he hailed from Swetes, the same Antiguan village as Curtly Ambrose, but had to wait until his 31st birthday for his Test debut, which came against South Africa in 1998-99. Jacobs's relish for fast bowling helped him top the batting averages on that unhappy tour, and three years later he notched his maiden Test century against the same opponents in Barbados, and scored two more after that - the second of which kept England's bowlers away from the West Indian tail as Brian Lara went about scoring his 400. Given a true pitch, Jacobs could be compelling viewing, unleashing booming strokes off either foot from a high backlift, but quality spin tended to tie him in knots. His batting, if inelegant, became more consistent and he was a valuable source of runs for West Indies. However, his glovework started to fail him and his form fell away dramatically in England in 2004.

The following winter he toured India (his first eight Tests were against them) again only standing out once. In fact, his first ten innings contained one hundred, one fifty, and eight scores of 13 or less - and four ducks.  He played once against Australia in 1983-84, making a superb 97 in front of his home crowd, a performance which won him a place on the 1984 England tour. He didn\'t appear in any of the Tests, but made 585 runs at 73.12 nevertheless.  Two mediocre series home and away to New Zealand followed, but he finally found consistency in India, his chanceless hundred at Calcutta the highlight.  Thereafter he was a more regular contributor, although there were still poor patches, most notably against Pakistan and Australia,  but in England in 1988 he topped the averages with 364 runs at 72.80, winning the Man of the Match at Lord\'s for his 81 and 95*.   However, his next visit to England was less successful and brought the curtain down on his Test career.  Logie remained loyal to his third-division club side, Texaco-Brighton, arguing that nobody wanted to know him when he was a nobody, and as he had started, there he would finish there.   After retiring in 1993, he moved into coaching, taking charge of Canada and then guided West Indies to their triumph in the 2004 Champions Trophy. But despite that, it was a difficult time for West Indies cricket and Logie\'s tenure was rarely without criticism and he quit ""by mutual consent"" shortly after returning home.  He then took charge of Bermuda, but inherited a side with deep-rooted problems, not the least being the poor personal discipline of many senior players.

6 ft 4 in ",,,Left-hand bat,Right-arm medium,Referee,Cousin - ,,"['\n6\'5"" with stooped shoulders, a large moustache and thick glasses (his eyes were damaged when he was 12 as he attempted to break up a fight at school), Clive Lloyd was the crucial ingredient in the rise of West Indian cricket. A cousin of Lance Gibbs, he was a hard-hitting batsmen and one of the most successful captains in history. An almost ponderous, lazy gait belied the speed and power at his command and the astute tactical brain that led the West Indies to the top of world cricket for two decades. \n', 'Clive Lloyd made his first-class debut as a left-hand middle-order batsman in the then British Guiana in 1963-64 and played for Haslingden in the Lancashire League in 1967. He was offered terms by Warwickshire before signing for Lancashire, making his debut for them in 1968, and winning his cap the following season.', 'Lloyd had already made his Test debut, against India at Mumbai (then Bombay) in December 1966, hitting 82 and 78 not out as he put on 102 runs with Sobers to win the match on a pitch helping the spinners. His first home Test also brought his first Test century, 118 against England in Trinidad that helped stave off defeat. Another century followed in the fourth Test of that series to confirm he was at home at the highest level. Touring Australia in 1968-69 he hit another Test century, at Brisbane, in his first Test against them.', ""Lloyd was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1971 for his performances in the previous 12 months, when he'd scored 1600 runs for Lancashire at 47. Often raising his game for the big occasion, he struck 126 against Warwickshire at Lord's to help Lancashire to the Gillette Cup (1972), and hit a wonderful century in the first ever World Cup Final at Lord's in 1975 to take the West Indies to victory."", 'At his best Lloyd was a flamboyant destroyer of bowling. His heavy bat, powerful shoulders and full swing of the arms could turn the course of any game, once scoring 201* in just 120 minutes against Glamorgan - equalling the record for the fastest ever first-class double hundred (1976).', ""Far from inhibiting his batting, Lloyd's first tour as captain (1974-75) marked a dramatic improvement after a run of low scores. 163 in the First Test at Bangalore (his century came in just 85 balls) was followed by a Test-best 242* in the Fifth Test in Mumbai to set up a series-deciding win for the West Indies. Often he was obliged to curb his natural, attacking instincts in order to work his team out of trouble, as on the tour of Australia of 1975-76 where he scored 469 runs at an average of 46.9 as his team were swept aside 5-1 by Thomson and Lillee."", 'The unsuccessful tour of Australia proved to be a major turning point in West Indian cricket however, as Lloyd decided to adopt the intimidatory tactics of the Australians and stack his team with fast bowlers. Some may say his job as captain was fairly straightforward: with a battery of fast bowlers including Roberts, Marshall, Garner, Holding and Croft at his command, and batsmen of the calibre of Greenidge, Haynes and Richards, he certainly had some handy players to call upon. But he instilled his talented side with the professionalism and determination to win consistently and when the conditions suited the opposition. He united the disparate threads of the separate nations that make up the West Indies, and was the force that gelled them as a team rather than a bunch of talented individuals. There was controversy too, though. Slow over rates and intimidation of batsmen with short-pitched bowling were both characteristics of his reign as captain. His side changed the way Test cricket was played too, as other nations copied the formula of fast bowling and intimidation he had come to admire in Australia.', 'During the Packer crisis Lloyd resigned as captain after disagreeing with the selectors on the eve of a Test against Australia (1977-78), but he returned to lead his team to the 1979 World Cup. On the subsequent tour of Australia he underwent surgery on his knee that improved his mobility and effectiveness. Centuries at Adelaide and Old Trafford followed, and back in the West Indies he found the most consistent form of his career as in nine successive innings his lowest score was 49 (run out). He averaged 76 in the series against England and a phenomenal 172.50 in domestic cricket.', 'Although age slightly decreased Lloyd\'s belligerence at the crease, he remained a key player in the middle order; able to dig the team out of trouble or add impetus when applicable. In Australia in 1981 he played the crucial innings to secure the West Indies a win at Adelaide to draw a series that had seemed destined to be won by Australia, encouraging his fast bowlers to rush on to the pitch and carry him off on their shoulders. Normal service was resumed with home and away victories against India and Australia. On his final tours he averaged 67 in England (1984) as the West Indies completed a famous 5-0 ""blackwash"", and 50.85 against Australia (1984-85) as he helped secure a 3-1 triumph.', ""Lloyd's final record as captain was remarkable, including a run of 26 Tests without defeat, and 11 successive wins. He also became the first West Indian to win 100 Test caps. Having been a schoolboy athletics champion, he became a brilliant cover fielder before knee problems forced a move to the slips, where he pouched many of his 90 Test catches."", 'Lloyd was a useful right-arm medium-pacer too, taking 114 first-class wickets in all (including a best of 4-48, Lancashire v Leicestershire at Old Trafford, 1970) with 10 in Tests. He was awarded a testimonial by Lancashire in 1977 (that raised £27,199) made captain of the club in 1981 and brought his children up in the county.', 'Although Lloyd has worked as a civil servant for Guyana Ministry of Health, he has remained involved in cricket. He has coached and commentated on the game, as well as managing the Guyana team. A promising career as ICC Match Official (he officiated in both semi-final and final of the 1996 World Cup) was put on hold to take on the management of the West Indies team after their disappointments in the World Cup. It was a frustrating period for Lloyd, whose hands were tied by the decision not to appoint him as a full selector (although he was a selector while on tour), and whose responsibilities became increasingly administrative. He resigned at the end of the 1999 tour of New Zealand after a three-year period that coincided with a decline in the fortunes of West Indies cricket.', 'With that experience behind him, he resumed his duties as an ICC Match Referee - a position he occupied with great presence and no little humour to earn the respect and confidence of the players. They knew he understands the game as well as anyone and that he holds the good of the game in the highest regard at all times. ', 'In 2008 Lloyd was appointed the chairman of the ICC Cricket Committee after Sunil Gavaskar stepped down to pursue his role as a media columnist and commentator.']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1971'],110.0,175,14,7515.0,242*,46.67,,,19,39,,70,90.0,0.0,87.0,69,19,1977.0,102,39.54,2434,81.22,1,11,,,39.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,490.0,730,96,31232,242*,49.26,,,79,172,,,377.0,0.0,375.0,343,72,10915,134*,40.27,,,12,69,,,146.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,110.0,45,1716,622,10.0,2/13,2/22,62.2,2.17,171.6,0,0,0,87.0,10,358,210,8.0,2/4,2/4,26.25,3.51,44.7,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,490.0,,9551,4104,114,4/48,,36.00,2.57,83.7,,0,0,375.0,,2938,1958,71,4/33,4/33,27.57,3.99,41.3,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

5 ft 8 in ",,,Left-hand bat,Legbreak googly,,,,"[""\nThe 10th of 11 children, Brian Lara learnt his game at the Harvard Coaching Clinic, where he was enrolled at the age of six, and although at school he played for Trinidad's junior football and table tennis side, it was cricket which really drew him. Aged 14, he made  745 runs at 126.16, earning him selection for the Trinidad Under-16 team. A year later he was in the West Indies Under-19 side.  In 1990, aged  20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest captain, leading them to victory in the Geddes Grant Shield. In that year he made his Test debut, scoring 44 and 6 against Pakistan. \n"", ""No-one since Bradman has built massive scores as often and as fast as Lara in his pomp. Even his stance was thrilling - the bat raised high in the air, the weight poised on a bent front knee, the eyes low and level. Then the guillotine would fall, sending the ball flashing to the boundary. In the space of two months in 1994, Lara's 375 and 501 not out broke world records for the highest Test and first-class scores, but sudden fame turned him into a confused and contradictory figure. During an inventive but largely fruitless spell as captain of a fading team, Lara reiterated his genius by single-handedly defying the 1998-99 Australian tourists with a sequence of 213, 8, 153 not out and 100. For a while, excess weight and hamstring problems hampered his once-lightning footwork, and the torrent of runs became an occasional spurt. But after Garry Sobers suggested a tweak to his flourishing backlift, Lara returned to his best in Sri Lanka in 2001-02, with 221 and 130 in one Test and 688 runs - a record 42% of West Indies' output - in the series, and reclaimed the captaincy the following year. "", 'The task proved as hard second time round, leading a side where he was far and away the best player and where discipline was a constant worry. He led them to defeat for a second time in South Africa, and then lost to England in the Caribbean, too. But then, just when all hope seemed to have deserted West Indies cricket, Lara responded to the prospect of a home series whitewash with an astonishing unbeaten 400 in the final Test against England in Antigua. In doing so, he became the first man to reclaim the world Test batting record, a feat that ensured he would stand alongside Shane Warne as the most charismatic cricketer of the modern era. ', ""Then followed a spectacular low, when Bangladesh came visiting and had West Indies in trouble in the one-day series and the first Test, prompting Lara to threaten his resignation if his batsmen did not lift their game. They responded in the following game, and Lara captained the side in England, where the team was beaten in every Test they played. Astonishingly, he then galvanised his charges and led the one-day team to victory in the ICC Champions Trophy to spark off hopes of a West Indies resurgence. But it was under Shivnarine Chanderpaul that Lara registered his next big moment - in Adelaide in November 2005, when he went past Allan Border's tally of 11174 runs to become Test cricket's most prolific scorer. Then in April 2006, after protracted dispute between the West Indies board and the players union (WIPA), he was reinstated - for the third time - as West Indies captain. Lara's leadership in the five-match one-day home series against India came in for much praise as the tourists were knocked over 4-1, but in the succeeding Test series he struggled. His captaincy was erratic - inspiring in parts, questionable on many occasions - though he later revealed that his hands were tied due to peripheral issues related to team selection."", 'In Pakistan he led by example with the bat but results continued to go against his side and as West Indies struggled both on and off the field, it became increasingly obvious that Lara was unable to inspire them to greater things, and he appeared increasingly at odds with many of his team-mates. The World Cup offered him a chance to bow out on home soil and on a high, but it was not to be. He showed glimpses of his abilities, but one fifty in seven innings was not enough as West Indies went out with a whimper. He quit, one ODI short of his 300, amid rumours of bitter disputes with administrators. It was a sad, but perhaps inevitable, way for such a genius to bow out.\n', ' April 2007']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1995', 'Honorary Member of the Order of Australia, Nov 2009']",131.0,232,6,11953.0,400*,52.88,19753,60.51,34,48,1559,88,164.0,0.0,299.0,289,32,10405.0,169,40.48,13086,79.51,19,63,,,120.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,261.0,440,13,22156,501*,51.88,,,65,88,,,320.0,0.0,429.0,411,43,14602,169,39.67,,,27,86,,,177.0,0.0,3.0,3,0,99,65,33.00,86,115.11,0,1,11,1,0.0,0.0,131.0,4,60,28,0.0,-,-,35.33,2.80,-,0,0,0,299.0,5,49,61,4.0,2/5,2/5,15.25,7.46,12.2,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,261.0,,514,416,4,1/1,,104.00,4.85,128.5,,0,0,429.0,,130,149,5,2/5,2/5,29.80,6.87,26.0,0,0,0,3.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,False,False,False,False

 ","['\nMalcolm Marshall slithered to the crease on the angle, pitter-pat feet twinkling as if in dancing shoes. It was reminiscent of a sidewinder on the attack. Purists occasionally criticised his action as too open, but it had method: he maintained mastery of orthodox outswing and inswing from a neutral position without telegraphing his intent. He was lithe, with a wickedly fast arm that elevated him to express status. Only in inches was he lacking - but he even turned that to his advantage with a bouncer as malicious as they come, skidding on to the batsman. Later in his career, he developed a devastating legcutter which he used on dusty pitches. Allied to a massive cricket intelligence, stamina and courage, Marshall had all the toys and he knew how and when to play with them. His strike rate of 46.22 was phenomenal, his average of 20.95 equally so. He may well have been the finest fast bowler of them all. \n', 'He reserved his best figures for England. In 1984, he broke his left thumb while fielding early in the match, but first of all batted one-handed, hitting a boundary and allowing Larry Gomes to complete a century, and then, with his left hand encased in plaster, he shrugged off the pain to take 7 for 53. Four years later, on an Old Trafford wicket prepared specifically for spinners, he adjusted his sights, pitched the ball up, and swung and cut it to such devastating effect that he took 7 for 22. Let that be a lesson, he seemed to be saying, and indeed it was. The whole cricket world mourned his tragically early death, from cancer, at 41.', '\n', '\nMARSHALL, MALCOLM DENZIL, who died of cancer on November 4, 1999, aged 41, was one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time. Even in the formidable line-up of West Indians whose speed and ferocity dominated world cricket for the last quarter of the 20th century, Marshall stood out: he allied sheer pace to consistent excellence for longer than anyone else; he was relentlessly professional and determined; and he was also the best batsman of the group, coming nearer than any recent West Indian to being an allrounder of the quality of Garry Sobers. Though batsmen feared him, he was exceptionally popular among his peers: his death was mourned throughout the cricket world, but his fellow-professionals, who knew him best, were most deeply affected.', 'Marshall was born in St Michael, Barbados. As with Sobers, his triumphs grew out of childhood tragedy: his father was killed in a road accident when he was a baby, and he learned the game from his grandfather as well as at the beach and the playground. He began as a batsman, then discovered his ability to strike back. After playing just one first-class match for Barbados as a 19-year-old, he was taken to India amid the confusion of the World Series schism in the weakened team captained by Alvin Kallicharran. He made his Test debut, aged 20, in December 1978 in Bangalore. Marshall made no immediate impact at that level but showed enough to be taken on by Hampshire as successor to Andy Roberts. He missed part of the 1979 season because of the World Cup. But, with West Indies back to full strength, he could not get on the field for them; on the team picture, standing next to Joel Garner and Colin Croft, he looks an insignificant figure. In county cricket, meanwhile, he did not yet have the firepower to carry a struggling team.', 'However, on the 1980 tour he secured a Test place and at Manchester was instrumental in causing a collapse of seven wickets for 24. It began to be noted that, although not physically imposing - he was 5ft 11in - he had a natural balance and athleticism. Furthermore, he applied himself to his craft. In 1982, he was devastating, taking 134 wickets for Hampshire - a figure no one else touched in county cricket in the last 32 years of the century - and building a reputation as the bowler best avoided by anyone with a sense of self-preservation. Careful observers noted that he also bowled more Championship overs than anyone else. His first really dominant Test performance came at Port-of-Spain the following March, when he took 5 for 37 against India. When West Indies played Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup semi-final at The Oval, he worked up top speed even in a one-day game, and it was obvious - though he was still first-change - that the global fast-bowling crown now rested on his head.', ""And there it stayed. Batsmen agreed that Marshall was hardest of all to face because of the way he used his ordinary height to produce telling rather than exceptional bounce. He was, they said, a skiddy bowler. His outswinger was magnificently controlled. And when he dropped short of a length - he was never shy of doing that - especially from round the wicket, he produced deliveries that were as physically intimidating as anything the game has seen. In 1983-84, he was the prime avenger for the World Cup final defeat by India, taking 33 wickets in a six-Test series which West Indies won 3-0. Less than four months later, he overpowered Australia's batsmen, taking five for 42 when they were 97 all out in Bridgetown, and 5 for 51 in Kingston. But it was at Headingley in July 1984 that he produced his most astonishing performance: on the first day, he broke his left thumb in the field and was assumed to be out of the game. When the ninth West Indian first-innings wicket fell, the England players were about to stroll off. Suddenly, Marshall marched down the dressing-room steps and batted one-handed long enough for Larry Gomes to score a century. Then, with his lower arm encased in pink plaster, Marshall took 7 for 53: bowling first at his normal pace, then swinging the ball in the heavy northern air, throughout showing an indomitable ability to play through pain that in itself helped force England into submission. He recovered from the injury to blast England out with a fusillade of bouncers at The Oval: his seventh five-for in ten Tests, a sequence he took to 11 in 14 a few months later when he took command of the series in Australia."", ""At this point, Marshall was in his unbeatable prime. He set the tone for the 1985-86 series against England by breaking Mike Gatting's nose in a one-day international, just as he had done when he hit Andy Lloyd (who never recovered as a top-level cricketer) at the start of the 1984 series. And he led an assault on the New Zealand batsmen in Kingston in 1984-85 that may well have been the most intimidatory of the lot. No umpire in the world - and certainly none in the West Indies - had the courage to limit properly the number of bouncers."", ""But venom was only part of his armoury. Marshall acquired ringcraft at an early stage: he developed the inswinger and the legcutter. And he became capable of playing vital Test innings as well, at No. 8 or even higher (he made 92 against India in 1983-84, and scored seven first-class centuries) without ever quite losing his fast bowler's relish in batting as a hobby. He produced another commanding performance with the ball in Lahore in 1986-87, and against the England rabble of 1988 took 35 wickets at just 12.65. Five of them came in an hour at Old Trafford where he finished with 7 for 22 and England were 93 all out. He rarely bowled a bouncer in that series; there was no real need. But in the report of the Old Trafford game "", "" noted the progress of the unknown Ambrose at the other end. Batsmen never threatened Marshall's dominance but soon after West Indian bowlers did. He did another blazing match (11 for 89) against India in Port-of-Spain in 1988-89, but more often he was one of the pack, and he played his 81st and final at The Oval in 1991, where Graham Gooch became his 376th Test victim. This remained a West Indian record until Walsh overtook him in 1998-99. But Marshall's average of 20.94 is unsurpassed by any bowler who has taken 200 Test wickets."", ""Marshall continued playing for Hampshire for the next two seasons, and was thrilled to bits when they won the 1992 Benson and Hedges final. He returned to the club as coach in 1996, emphasising that this was not the ordinary businesslike relationship that exists between a county and an overseas pro. He became West Indies' coach that year too, though by the time he was taken ill during the 1999 World Cup, Marshall was inevitably taking his share of the blame for the team's inability to live up to the standards he had himself helped to set. The fact that both his old teams wished to employ him was a testament to the esteem in which he was held. He was diagnosed with cancer of the colon in the spring of 1999. Chemotherapy in England failed, and he went home to Barbados, marrying his girlfriend Connie a few weeks before he died."", 'It was his willingness to work hard at his game that made Malcolm Marshall supreme even in a great generation. He was a relentlessly probing and thoughtful opponent - his Hampshire team-mate Robin Smith said he could nominate the deliveries that would get players out. And, to an extent matched only by the slightly more sedate Walsh, he was willing to produce his best on dull days and dull pitches when other overseas players might lay off the accelerator. After play, he was affable among his fellow pros and polite to all-comers.

He had a fine season with Worcestershire at the Friends Life t20 in England in July 2013 and a ground-breaking Caribbean Premier League a month later when his team Jamaica Tallawahs became champions.

Like Richards, he also declined to wear a helmet, and his wide-brimmed maroon sunhat became a trademark. He was a destructively brilliant batsman, particularly on hard pitches where he could throw the bat through the line with abandon, carving the ball square. He hooked willingly too, usually up, frequently for six. Criticism was usually directed at his lack of concentration, but he was capable of that: his 69 grafted out over four hours on a vile pitch at Edgbaston in 1995 was a masterly exhibition of bad-wicket play. He reserved his finest innings for the Australians: only Sachin Tendulkar and Jack Hobbs have bettered his nine centuries against them. The finest was at Georgetown in March 1991, when he blasted 182, including 106 in the final session of the first day.', '\n', ' \n']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1992'],86.0,146,12,5949.0,194,44.39,,,16,27,,23,90.0,0.0,224.0,217,30,6248.0,122,33.41,9801,63.74,5,44,,,75.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,86.9,,,,,,,234.0,390,31,14618,194,40.71,,,37,68,,,207.0,0.0,313.0,304,37,8458,122,31.67,,,6,59,,,92.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,86.0,7,66,18,0.0,-,-,35.33,1.63,-,0,0,0,224.0,6,58,46,1.0,1/4,1/4,46.0,4.75,58.0,0,0,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,7.05,,,,,234.0,,913,441,13,5/40,,33.92,2.89,70.2,,1,0,313.0,,88,85,2,1/4,1/4,42.50,5.79,44.0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False

While he has only managed a brief and disappointing Test career, he has shown his value as a limited-overs player for West Indies, particularly in the shortest format, and has also forged a successful career for various franchises around the world including Mumbai Indians, Brisbane Heat and Karachi Kings. ', ' \n', ' \nSimmons, the nephew of the former West Indies allrounder Phil, was handed his international debut in late 2006, during an ODI series in Pakistan, and scored 70 in his second match. It was to be his only half-century in his first nine international innings, however, and he was soon left out of the side. ', ' \nHe returned in March 2009, this time making his Test debut, having forced his way back by scoring 282 in a first-class game for West Indies A against the touring England XI. His returns, however, were poor: the last of the eight Tests he has played so far came in October 2011, and his 16 innings have only yielded a highest score of 49. ', "" \nBut he has enjoyed happier times in the limited-overs formats. ODI highlights include the 792 runs he scored in 2011, at 49.50, including a maiden century and eight fifties, and the start he enjoyed to the 2015 World Cup, with an 84-ball 102 against Ireland followed by a 46-ball 50 against Pakistan. In T20Is, he has been a frequent source of brisk runs anywhere in the top four. He has been one of the most consistent overseas players in the IPL, and topped Mumbai's run-charts with 540 runs at 45.00, helping the team clinch the IPL title in 2015. "", "" \nSimmons played a brief but vital role in West Indies' title run at the 2016 World T20. Initially ruled out of the tournament with a back injury, he got his chance thanks to a hamstring injury suffered by Andre Fletcher just before the semi-finals. Having arrived in the country only a day-and-a-half earlier, he scored an unbeaten 51-ball 82 at the Wankhede Stadium - his home ground in the IPL - to make short work of India's total of 192 and steer West Indies into the final.

After his first Test innings, 84 not out against Pakistan, Ted Dexter was moved to predict a Test average of more than 50 - quite a millstone to hang around any young player's neck. But on his first tour, to England in 2000, Sarwan lived up to the hype by topping the averages. His footwork, which seemed to require no early trigger movements, was strikingly confident and precise. \n"", ""It was a surprise when he then produced a horror run of three runs in five innings in Australia, but against India in 2001-02 he was back to his composed best. Sarwan, who took over as Brian Lara's vice-captain in March 2003, required 28 matches and 49 innings to post his maiden Test century - 119 in December 2002 - and even then it came against the less-than-mighty Bangladeshis. As the likes of Graham Gooch and Steve Waugh can testify, the first time is often the hardest. "", 'A dream series against South Africa in 2003-04, where he averaged nearly 100 runs a Test, was followed by a lean run against England. But he returned to form in a stunning manner with an unbeaten 261 against Bangladesh in June. Then came an England tour in 2004 where he began and ended the tour on a low note, but was prolific in the middle. However, West Indian fortunes were on the ascendancy in one-dayers, as they reached the finals of the NatWest Series and then won the ICC Champions Trophy with Sarwan playing a big hand in both tournaments. ', 'Sarwan was one of the players involved in a contract dispute with WICB and missed the first Test against South Africa in 2005. On his return he scored attractive runs, but was again overlooked for the captaincy when it was handed back to Brian Lara. ', ""He didn't fare well with the bat in the 2006-07 season, averaging just 25.90 in 13 games he played till the end of the Champions Trophy. It was still a shock when he was dropped from the second Test against Pakistan in the away series in November. He returned for the third Test and sustained a foot injury which kept him out of the one-dayers against Pakistan and the tour of India."", ""Finally, the West Indies captaincy came his way following Lara's retirement. It wasn't exactly a field full of promising candidates as West Indies cricket yearned for true leadership. Injuries limited his appearances in 2007, and a friendly captaincy competition between Sarwan and Gayle continued with both players publicly supporting one another. Sarwan was Gayle's deputy on his return to the side in 2008 for the home series against Sri Lanka but the demotion did not affect his output, and he made three half-centuries and a hundred in the two Tests."", 'In the 2009 home series against England, Sarwan recorded his personal best of 291 in the first innings of the fourth Test, equalling the highest score for the West Indies made by Sir Vivian Richards. He scored his 15th Test century against England at Chester-le-Street in May of the same year but West Indies lost the series 2-0. ', 'The following year, Sarwan lost his central contract in 2010, subsequently winning damages from the West Indies Cricket Board over comments made about his attitude and fitness. He played his last Test against India in Bridgetown in July 2011. ', ""Having fallen out of international favour, he signed for English county Leicestershire for the 2012 English season and enjoyed noteworthy success in a struggling side, scoring two centuries in the Championship, another two in 40-over matches and falling short of 1,000 first-class runs largely because injury caused him to miss two matches.  He agreed to return as four-day captain in 2013 but played only half the season because of injury and West Indies' limited-overs commitments."", 'West Indies recalled him for the first time in 18 months for the limited overs side that toured Australia in early 2013, although it was an inauspicious return.  He was out without scoring in each of the first two ODIs and omitted after the third, in which he made 12.

When he started his Test career at 19, without yet representing his native Jamaica in a first-class match, his composure and skill prompted comparisons - quite unfairly - with Viv Richards. His technique was near to faultless, and he exudes a bull-headed confidence - he used to skip his schoolwork on the basis that exams were irrelevant to future Test cricketers. \n', ""However, that confidence, which often overflowed into perceived arrogance, has landed him in plenty of trouble. It almost got him sent home from India late in 2002 after he defied a team curfew - but he was kept on, and responded with his a disciplined maiden Test century in Kolkata. His lack of consistency meant he remained an irregular member of the team in the 2000s, but just before his selection for the 2007 World Cup, he was drawn into a major controversy after Nagpur police alleged that he passed on match-related information to an alleged bookie ahead of an ODI against India. He was included in the World Cup squad despite the ICC's investigations into the issue, where he only briefly shone, ending the tournament by running out Brian Lara in his last international innings."", 'He was called for the World Twenty20 in South Africa in 2007, but the match-fixing allegations reared its head in 2008 when he was found guilty of ""receiving money, or benefit or other reward that could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute."" Samuels was subsequently banned for two years, at a time when West Indies desperately needed solidity in their middle-order. He returned to the West Indies Test and ODI teams in 2011, but it was only on the tour to England in 2012 that he finally showed what he was capable of. Against a top-class bowling attack in difficult conditions, Samuels scored 386 runs in five innings, with a century and three fifties, defying the England bowlers every time with his correct technique and classy strokeplay. Later that year came a highlight of his career: a gutsy, snappy 78 in the World Twenty20 final against Sri Lanka, which lifted West Indies out of a hole and to their first world title since the 1979 World Cup.', ""A month after the World T20 triumph, Samuels notched up his first Test double-century, scoring 260 against Bangladesh in Khulna. Consistency eluded him, however, as the big scores were often followed by dips in form and injuries. A facial injury suffered during the Big Bash League in January 2013 ruled him out of West Indies' limited-overs tour to Australia. He picked up a four-for on his return to international cricket against Zimbabwe but his batting form did not improve. Samuels scored just two international hundreds, both in ODIs, in the two seasons following the double-hundred and his lack of form in Tests, and competitions like the World T20, only contributed further to West Indies' struggles. As a result of his poor form, he was dropped after just one Test in the home series against New Zealand in June 2014. "", 'Samuels, who is a handy part-time offspinner, was reported for a suspect action during the second Test against India in Mumbai in November 2013, along with offspinner Shane Shillingford. Following a biomechanical analysis of his action, Samuels was barred from bowling quicker deliveries in international cricket in December 2013.']",[],71.0,127.0,7.0,3917.0,260,32.64,8219.0,47.65,7.0,24.0,537.0,32.0,28.0,0.0,207.0,196,26,5606.0,133*,32.97,7463,75.11,10,30,526,118,50.0,0.0,67.0,65,10,1611.0,89*,29.29,1386,116.23,0,10,144,69,12.0,0.0,122.0,211,12,7295,260,36.65,,,14,40,,,68.0,0.0,275.0,261,36,7652,133*,34.00,,,14,44,,,66.0,0.0,187.0,181.0,38.0,4571.0,106*,31.96,3876.0,117.93,2.0,29.0,388.0,191.0,45.0,0.0,71.0,69,4392,2445,41.0,4/13,6/50,59.63,3.34,107.1,1,0,0,207.0,134,5091,4127,89.0,3/12,3/12,46.37,4.86,57.2,0,0,0,67.0,30,479,622,22.0,3/23,3/23,28.27,7.79,21.7,0,0,0,122.0,,7432,3909,71,5/87,,55.05,3.15,104.6,,1,0,275.0,,7003,5464,135,4/21,4/21,40.47,4.68,51.8,2,0,0,187.0,92,1636,1957,70,3/10,3/10,27.95,7.17,23.3,0,0,0,False,True,False,True
